Subject:Good day.

Dear Friend,
Good day.
I have some information for you about your unpaid fund, the people you are
dealing with is not the original bank, why can't you deal with the bank
instead of sending money to people to help you get your fund, I have their
direct Contact Information and I can direct you to the proper office/Bank
where you can get paid than to be wasting your time and money.
And just bear it in mind that all this money you have been sending would
have completed your payment transmission before now. Email me back only on
this email  samchambers594@yahoo.com.hk
Waiting to hear from you if you needed my assistance.
Regards,
Barr. Samuel Agbala
