Subject:bad news... (incredibly time sensitive!)
Hey,

If you're opening this on Monday, I may have some 
bad news for you... 

Over the past four days, I've tried everything in 
my power to try to make sure you're going to make
it to Rich Schefren's free training on time...

If you're running late, don't waste time... click 
now, and try to register right away.

Now, here's why I've been trying my hardest to be
sure you make it to this training... 

Rich is one of my personal coaches, and someone I
credit with a lot of my recent success... and, my
record year in 2010 too. 

He's also the guy who wrote the ONLY ebook that I
have ever printed out... and I do mean ever. 

I've read a good 1,500 to 2,000 ebooks over my 13
years online... and Rich's is the only one I felt 
was worth printing, putting in a hard binder, and 
saving to refer back to time and time again... 

It's called the "Internet Business Manifesto" and
if you still have time, you'll get a copy of that
ebook, for free, when you register for his killer
free training...

This will be the last email I send you about this
free training event for the foreseeable future...

If you're feeling frustrated, overwhelmed, and as
though you're never making any progress no matter
how much time, effort, and energy you're spending
on your business... you need to learn from Rich.

But please, hurry... and I'm not kidding.

It's time you go from frustration, to freedom. 

Thanks & Good Luck,
Gary Ambrose
