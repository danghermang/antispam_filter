                  IMMEDIATE RE-ISSUING OF YOUR ATM CARD.

Your attention is to be drawn to the current development on your ATM card delivery which has been deactivated for security reasons as we found out it was delivered to a wrong address different from its original delivery address through the delivery company online tracking system.

The ATM card is loaded with your $3,100,000.00musd (Three million one hundred thousand United States dollars) been the approved compensation to you by the EU (European Union) in respect of your contract/inheritance payment as directed by the supreme court of England, See link below:

You will be required to contact the refund programme director for the re-issuing of your ATM card without further delay to process and deliver your ATM card through your trusted and secured courier company to you in your country with the details below:

Name: Mr Antonio Juan

Email:  mrantonio@live.com

Direct contact mobile no. +34 672987337

Once you contact him, details required to re-issue and deliver your ATM card will be sent to you without further delay for re-processing and delivery.

We will not want to entertain same security lapses concerning the delivery as there will be no room for re-issuing of your card to enable the continuation of the programme.
