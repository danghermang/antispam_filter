MOST IMPORTANTLY: Due to the content of the package, the courier company mandated that before your package will be shipped, a Stamp Duty must be procured according to the New Shipping Creed on all packages leaving The essence of such Document is to ensure a hitch-free delivery and the amount of the Stamp Duty Fee is 98 USD. When this is done, the Courier Company will issue you with the tracking numbers for your package before the shipping commences.

Therefore reconfirm your current delivery address. Do not forget that this $98 USD is all that you should send to them, the rest of the fees have been paid. Finally, for security reasons, and considering the huge amount the ATMCard contains, the package was coded thus, Registration Ref: skyxxx/777# 

This is the code number that you will send to the courier company while contacting them and note that the courier company is not aware what the content of the package is. We told them that it contained some very vital official documents being sent to an offshore staff. Do not reveal the content of the package to the courier company or any body for security purposes. The information of the courier company is here-by given to you as soon as you respond to this message,


Please hurry now as your package might incur demurral if it stays more than 3 days with courier company,


Thanks,
Lord Charles Twyford ATM Department
