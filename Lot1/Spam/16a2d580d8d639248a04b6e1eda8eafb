Subject:VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR FUND
Hello Dear FRIEND,

I am Miss FAITH OKEKE. A computer scientist with central bank of Nigeria. I Am 26 years old, just started work with C.B.N.? I came across your file which was Marked X and your released disk painted RED, I took time to study it and found out that you have paid VIRTUALLY all fees and certificate but the fund has not been release to you. The most annoying thing is that they cannot tell you the truth that on no account will they ever release the fund to you, instead they
Let you spend money unnecessarily.

I do not intend to work here all the days of my life, I can release this fund to you if you can certify me of my security, and how I can run away from this Nigeria if I do this, because if I don't run away from this country after I made the transfer, I will be seriously in trouble and my life will be in danger. Please this is like a Mafia setting in Nigeria, you may not understand it
Because you are not a Nigerian.

The only thing I will need to release this fund is a special HARD DISK we call it HD120 GIG. I will buy two of it, recopy your information, destroy the previous one, and purchase the computer to reflect in your bank within 24 banking hours. I will clean up the tracer and destroy your file, after which I will run away from Nigeria to meet with you. If you are interested.

SPECIAL INFORMATION: YOU WILL SEND THE FEE FOR THE HARD DISK FIRST BEFORE I MAKE YOUR TRANSFER OR YOU BUY THE HARD DISK IN YOUR COUNTRY AND SEND IT TO ME, DON'T CONTACT ME IF YOU CAN NOT SEND THE HARD DISK FEE FIRST OR THE HARD DISK.AS SOON AS I RECEIVED YOUR EMAIL I WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE DISK WILL COST YOU.

Do get in touch with me immediately, You should send to me your convenient tell/fax numbers for easy communications and also re confirm your banking details, so that there won't be any mistake.
For phone conversation, please call me on +2348052520211

Regards,

Miss FAITH OKEKE
