Subject:Don't get me wrong
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and romantic. I like fitness, as I get not only my beautiful body after it but also a positive mood!. 
It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, reliable and with various interests. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://tovanuhe.metrohosting.info If you want to know me better
