Subject:Letter from the bride
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very kind and romantic. I adore kids, and I feel that it is time to have my own children.. 
It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, reliable and with good sense of humor. 
And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://dgjorux.5ballov.ru If you want to know me better
