Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Mr.Cave Man,I'm a Singaporean and a seasoned Banker with Malaysia 
HSBC Bank (Malaysia office), am as well an account officer to a deceased 
customer of our bank, we lost this customer in the tsunami disaster on the 26th 
December 2004 in Sumatra Indonesia. http://asc-india.org/lib/20041226-sumatra.htm 
and his account of US$19.761 million with us have been unclaimed due to 
unavailability of next of kin/relatives to claim his estate.

My late customer was awarded two different contracts with Shell Development 
Company here before his untimely demise on 26th December 2004

In accordance with the escheat laws in Malaysia as a kingdom, the board of 
directors of the bank met forth night ago and resolved to turn the estate of the 
deceased over to Government having waited for too long without the deceased 
relatives/next of kin surfacing property and if this is done, invariably, the 
funds will end up to become Government property and it is as a result of this 
that am moved to contact you considering the fact that you share almost the same 
name with the deceased.

In view of this, I am seeking your cooperation and understanding to stand as the 
deceased next of kin to enable us claim the inheritance before the period given 
by the bank elapse. If you are interested and in agreement with me, get back to 
me quickly and I will send to you all our bank contacts and the information you 
may need to proceed without coming to Malaysia, and be rest assured that it is 
risk free project and the proceedings will be shared 50% each once the fund are 
repatriated into your account anywhere in the world.

Please reply mrcaveman22@yahoo.co.uk immediately with your information including 
your telephone number for easy communication and oral discussion. I await your 
prompt response immediately. 

Best Regards.


Mr.Cave Man
