***NOTE*** Please print this page for your records. You'll need your
verification link if you lose access to your account (for example,
if you forget your username or password).

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user
entered your email address while trying to create an account for a different
email address. If you don't click the verification link, the account won't
be activated.

If you didn't request this email, but you decide to use this account,
or delete it, you'll first need to reset the account password by
entering your email address at
https://www.google.com/accounts/recovery.

If clicking the link above does not work, copy and paste the URL in a
new browser window instead.
