Subject:CONTACT MY SECRETARY AT mark.geoffery010@kimo.com
Dear Friend,
 
How are you today? Hope all is well with you and your family and this mail meets you in a perfect condition? You may not understand why this mail came to you, but if you do not remember me, you might have received an email from me in the past regarding a Multi-million-dollar business proposal which we never Concluded. I am using this opportunity to inform you that this Multi-million-dollar business has been concluded with another partner from France who financed it to a logical conclusion. I thank you for your great effort to our unfinished transfer of funds into your account due to one reason or the other best known to you.
 
But I want to inform you that I have successfully transferred the fund out of my bank to my new partner's account that was capable of assisting me in this great venture. Due to the effort, sincerity, courage and trustworthiness you showed during the course of the transaction, I have decided to compensate you and show my gratitude to you with the sum of $850,000.00.
 
I left an international certified bank draft with my secretary in South Africa for you worth $850,000.00; cashable any where in world. I have authorized him to release the international certified bank draft to you as soon as you contact him regarding this issue. My dear friend, I will like you to contact him for the collection of this international certified bank draft. At the moment, I'm already in France and very busy here due to the investment projects which myself and my new partner is having at hand.
 
Please I will like you to accept this token with good faith as this is from the bottom of my heart.
