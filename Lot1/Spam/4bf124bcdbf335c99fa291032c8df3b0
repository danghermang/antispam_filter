Subject:No I did not go
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very beautiful and generous. 

I like to travel there. I would like to try some extreme sports. I am very adventure woman.. It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be ambitious, educated and with various interests. 

I want to love and to be loved http://yejijew.cjjb.net Let's begin our acquaintance
