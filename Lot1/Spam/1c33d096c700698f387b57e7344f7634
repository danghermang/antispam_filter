Subject:Hello, you my friend?
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very nice and responsive. 

I like animals and I always try to help every living being.. It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, communicative and very attentive. 
I want to love and to be loved http://yipuqiya.prohosts.org Let's begin our acquaintance
