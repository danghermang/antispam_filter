Everything inside the restaurant feels modern and opulent from the lifesized sculptures against the wall to the blown glass vases placed in their own speciallycarved recesses in the wall Service is extraordinarily attentive and fast; it wont be long after youve completed one course before the next course is delivered to your table Everything is prompt and the servers are very effervescent and seem to care about their patrons checking in to make sure everything was prepared to their liking The bread came out first which was nothing to complain about Two different breads came in the bread basket one of which was toasted and the other one was light and fluffy It was served with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette for dipping For the rest of our meal we ended up doing the three course tasting menu with sparkling wine The sparkling wine came out first and I got the J Vineyards rose while my girlfriend got the Drusian Prosecco The rose was the better of the two and had a nice fruiti
 ness to it with a mild acidic finish The prosecco was drier and had a milder flowery flavor to it As we continued sipping on our sparkling wines out came the antipasti I ordered the fennel soup which was just exceptional It was made from a blood orange gelee toasted brioche and a Sicilian fennel seed the menu also said salsa cruda although I didnt see or taste that but who knows? It really had a wonderful flavor that was somehow savory sweet and spicy all at the same time My girlfriend got the carne cruda piemontese which came with ciabatta crostini Italianstyle toasted ciabatta bread on which you could spread a meat patty made from veal tartare truffled porcini mushrooms and lemon I wasnt as crazy about this but Im usually not crazy about the earthy flavor of mushrooms That said my girlfriend who is much more of a mushroom lover agreed that my fennel soup was the better appetizer For our secondi I got the Angus beef ribeye which was made with a sauce from a  year Lagavulin 
 scotch; it was then topped with a celeriac celery root and carrot puree along with shallots on the side The steak was good enough although the flavor was milder than I expected and nothing really brought the flavor of the scotch out My girlfriend got the grouper agghiotta which was a grouper and white prawns served in a red sauce "agghiotta" made from San Marzano tomatoes plum tomatoes orange olive oil and a variety of vegetables The grouper in the agghiotta sauce was definitely the highlight of all of our dishes; it had a wonderful spiced flavor to it that was just excellent brimming with flavors That said I wasnt as crazy about the prawns in the agghiotta sauce; it was harder to taste the agghiotta flavor amidst the very large meaty prawns For our final dolci course we ordered the orange creamcicle and chocolate tortino The <br><br>
creamcicle was a panna cotta with the traditional orange and vanilla flavors; it was then topped with a vanilla anglaise sauce It had a very nice sweet flavor to it that was just excellent I wasnt as crazy about the chocolate tortino molten chocolate cake although it was also good If you like chocolate you will really like the chocolatecovered chocolate that is the molten chocolate tortino It is covered in chocolate sauce served with four raspberries and then placed with a scoop of hazelnut ice cream on the side Although I wasnt crazy about the chocolate tortino I WAS crazy about the hazelnut ice cream What a great flavor which certainly complemented the chocolate very well Overall Quattro was an enjoyable experience Id recommend it if youre in the area and are looking for something Italian influenced but is different from its other Italian counterparts in the most creative and fun way possible Youll get all of that along with some great flavors and a nice comforting ambiance
  at the Four Seasons Quattro Restaurant Was this   Funny Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Katie Anne N Elite   friends  s Katie Anne N San Francisco CA   This  is for the BAR After deciding to avoid downtown Palo Alto on a Saturday night we spontaneously stopped at the Four Seasons Bar Quattro for a night cap The valet kindly parked the car for us even though we were not guests The best part about that was when we retrieved the car at the end of the night they remembered my bfs namecar without even asking That is top notch service right there Ive never had that happen before at any establishment Good job  The bar area is long with a few lounge seats in the front of the bar If you walk past the bar youll reach the open dining room of the restaurant Beautiful place Ill have to check that one one of these days  We ordered a couple of cocktails which were great We also decided on some dessert and chose the cheesecake Super delish The bartend
 er was super nice Offered us some fresh fruit that was in season that they were using for specialty drinks Highly recommend this bar for a drink if you want to escape the rest of the nightlife in the area Beautiful property and decor Youll receive top notch service as expected from any Four Seasons Highly recommend Was this   Funny Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from marc a  friends  s marc a Belmont CA   Overall the food quality is good However the service and business practices are outright horrible and unprofessional The service in an empty restaurant took us about  minutes get water Once that was finally delivered and the food arrived we noticed there was no silverware on the table with no servers in sight to help us out The worst part about this place is the business practice We had a <br><br>gift card that we were told expired however being in California that is not possible They said they would confirm with their finance department t
 hat it was never used and they would be able to apply the gift card value to our bill but would require us to put down a credit card which would be refunded once the gift card was processed We were informed the next day that would not honor that agreement and would charge our credit card the full amount In addition to the restaurant manager not honoring her verbal agreement she has not returned any phone calls Disappointed in this restaurant and the management for making promises and not following through on their agreements Was this   Funny   Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Susie O  friends  s Susie O San Jose CA   My darling luvah took me to the Four Seasons for a Valentines bedbreakfast weekend and we dined at Quattro Sat night and had brunch the next morning The decor is beautiful and service is impeccable but the food was not as impressive A few of our dishes came out lukewarm  Dinner Notables   Lobster Risotto  rich dynamic flavor
  but the rice was a tad undercooked  Raviolli stuffed with smoked sausage  Delicious Wellcooked and bursting with flavor  Italian donut wmelted chocolate and salted caramel sauce  The salted caramel was dip was great but everything was againlukewarm  Ribeye  cooked perfectly great cut butyesthey let it rest too long before servingArgh The dinner service was outstanding Pierre our friendly server was very knowledgeable about the menu and  made some outstanding recommendations The bussers were very efficient Brunch Notables  Quattro Benedict  Delicious The bread that the poached egg and shaved parma were served on was great Againthe meal was barely warm Potatoes were almost cold  Mimosas were not good They used cheap champagne and low quality orange juice  Brunch service was excellent Our server was very attentive warm and helpful Bottom Line Dinner & Brunch were memorable only for the great service and my delicious date Wouldnt go out of my way to come back Was this     Funny
  Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Andrew K Elite   friends  s Andrew K Palo Alto CA   $ for a three course meal? Sign me up  The Sunday Supper indeed was a fantastic deal   My gf and I agreed that the starters were the highlight of the meal  A great wedge salad amazing sausage flatbread Ill let you guess who ordered what  The mains were a bit heavy and only soso pestoinfused pasta and a lamb dish but the desserts sponge cake type dish and apple crepe were delectable Service was efficient and cordial but I dont really understand why the servers rotated throughout the entire meal  I cant really complain since everyone was friendly and helpful but it just seemed strange that random waiters that we had never seen before would stop by asking if everything is alright   Overall the Sunday Supper deal is highly recommended Was this   Funny Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Katja J  friend  s Katja J Hamburg Germa

 ty is I automatically think of The Four Seasons and the restaurant there Quattro  As someone who plans a lot of <br><br>meetings I appreciate an organized and communicative staff which you will find there  RichBeverage Director RobCatering Manager Marcochef and NicolePR are a phenomenal team to work with if you want to host a fun stress yet impressive event   The chef specializes in regional Italian cuisine made from local fresh ingredients and is willing and happy to customize menus for specific tastes and for your budget  Ditto of the beverage director  Friends and colleagues seem surprised when I suggest the Four Seasons asking me "Isnt that expensive"?  However Ive found that within a reasonable budget the team at the Four Seasons will go out of their way to accommodate you   This is in contrast to the lack of value you might receive at other luxury hotels nearby  Rob with catering is great at interpreting your wishes in terms of the ambiance for your specific purpose wh
 ether it is a business function or personal celebration  From an event held last May we still get happy comments regularly from guests who attended an event  months ago on everything from the food to the layout and so on What we had Asparagus SoupDivine perfect Quinoa Saladhealthy and delicious Chicken Cacciatorehearty Rigatoni Bolognesehouse made pasta noodles need I say more? Dessertthey can do "healthy" Panna cottafruit combo options or choose from a variety of more traditional desserts I was just asked today "Where should we have our meeting" and without pause I said "The Four Seasons" so hence this  Was this     Funny   Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Peggy T  friends  s Peggy T Irvine CA    Checkin Here I have been ruminating over writing this  for the last  hours   hours while I was actually there having dinner and the  minutes it took to drive home The first  minutes at this restaurant ruined my mood for the rest of dinner and t
