Subject:Confirm Bank Transfer
Hello,

I am Mr.Mark Morris presently working with the Financial Service Authorities 
United Kingdom(FSA). I have urgent information which you might find very 
useful. Following investigations carried out by my office,I have discovered 
that there are some long overdue payment presently here in the United Kingdom 
yet to be claimed. These funds have been processed in your name and should be 
released to you ASAP as directed by financial instruments but we are 
realizing that the earlier documents validating this sum was re written or 
altered.

Furthermore, we received an email from one Paul Miller who told us that he is 
your next of kin and that you died in a car accident couple of months ago.

To enable me confirm the status of the information I have for you, I need you 
to confirm the account information below, as this is the destination we have 
for the funds processed in your name and the transfer should be effected by 
Monday 30 May 2011 13:00 Hrs.

are dead or not.And to also know if you authorize the transfer of your funds 
to the account mentioned above.

entitlements in the United Kingdom is being redirected for personal interest
