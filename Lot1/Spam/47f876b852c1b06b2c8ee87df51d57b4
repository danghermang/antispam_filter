 find an umbrella for my drink but spared me the embarrassment and pretended that he couldnt find one The food was genuinely excellent across the board made only better with the extravagant and voluptuous red wine chosen and paid for by our generous dining companions  I had homemade pasta with a buffalo ragu tasty and lean and I couldnt tell you what anyone else had because I was so satisfied with my choice I forgot to look up I did notice that the portions were pretty modest in size but dont take this as a complaint as if were being honest fine dining is about quality over quantity  Still if youre dropping some Jacksons to eat you certainly dont want to go home hungry For dessert I had an artisan cheese selection that came with honeycomb dried fruit and other incredible accoutrement  A gorgeous way to top off a lovely meal and wonderful evening spanning nearly  hours The service was terrific  friendly knowledgeable and supportive you know the kind with a gasp actual opinion

Note  EXCELLENT expense account option for you boondogglers out there  For cheapskates like me a good option would be landing here for a night cap and cheese plate for dessert while soaking up the vibe and watching at all of the Silicon Valley executive types Listed in Brad Ps personal favorite… If money were no object   Was this   		 		Funny 		Cool 		 		 Add owner comment 		 Bookmark 		 Send to a Friend 		 Link to This 		 		 		 from Anna R 		 		Elite  		  friends 		  s 		Anna R 		 Palo Alto CA 		 		    Checkins Here  Ive frequented Quattro about a half dozen times for brunch with my man making it one 
 
 of our favorite weekend spots to start the day Sometimes we are nice enough to take along his parents and on one occasion my mom when she was visiting from Germany  The ambiance is great with amazing decorations Whether its the handmade colorful vases on one wall the extensive lighting architecture in the room or the giant cement slabs behind a glass wall that are hollowed out with various human shapes I always have something to stare at while I wait for my food  The host is very friendly and efficient always asking if youd like your coat to be taken and the waiters are equally attentiveThey have that certain knowhow here when to leave you alone for a while and when to be a little more present  We generally try to order at least one new dish on their seasonally changing menu but are always happy to stick to a couple of our favorites that fortunately have not yet been removed from the selection Our alltime winner is definitely the scrambled egg pizza Thin crust slices of heav
 en topped with sundried tomato Italian sausage and mozzarella topped with juicy scrambled egg for breakfast  who doesnt want that? A few weeks ago we shared the pizza and the smoked turkey club which was served on deliciously fresh rosemary focaccia with applewood smoked bacon avocado and tomato The sandwich was accompanied by crispy parmesan french fries  If you have a sweet tooth in the morning I recommend their lemon strawberry pancakes or their amazing French toast with mascarpone  Their mimosas and bellinis are priced a little to steep for my taste so we usually order the fresh juice of the day which is always to die for Last time it was a blend of bananas peaches and strawberries if I remember correctly Ive always left here stuffed and happy Listed in Ladies who Brunch  Was this   		 		Funny 		Cool 		 		 Add owner comment 		 Bookmark 		 Send to a Friend 		 Link to This 		 		 		 from Betty N 		 		Elite  		  friends 		  s 		Betty N 		 Santa Monica CA 		 		 Updated     ph

 still blown away by Edward Higgins mastery of the food arts He just knows how to pair food together balancing authentic flavors and yet teasing the palette with twists and turns For example the veal tartare crostini Say what? I have been schooled please see picture I didnt know such heavenly veal bliss even existed Thank you Edward You have enlightened me and some My personal alltime favorite was the toasted brioche and almonds in garlic butter with almond sorbet which was as amazing as it sounds Who knew bread and sorbet can go well together and it did The tomato gazpacho was also fantastic Super SUPER fresh I can NEVER get enough of the pastas here Had the smoked bucatini with cabbage fontina and mushrooms and it was just incredible I was daydreaming of Italy while eating The hybrid striped sea bass with crispy skin shaved fennel red onion micro cilantrofennel and olives was experimental and I appreciated the creativity with the simple ingredients The roasted quail with br
 uleed figs and rosemary balsamic quail reduction was another favorite of mine Nothing beats sweet figs and delicious quail it is a classic winning combination I absolutely love this restaurant and I cannot wait to return It seems too good to be true really Another memorable meal engraved    to be continued Listed in PALO ALTO EATS FOR THE… BEST RESTAURANTS FOR DATES…  Was this   		 		Funny 		Cool 		  Previous s Show all »  		 		 HOLY MOSES PART THE WATERS GOOD I havent eaten this well in the Bay Area since    since   … Read more »  		 		 Add owner comment 		 Bookmark 		 Send to a Friend 		 Link to This 		 		 		 from Denise Q 		 		Elite  		  friends 		  s 		Denise Q 		 San Francisco CA 		 		   Of course if you are dining at the Four Seasons you are expecting a certain dining experience   And so we were at Quattro after a fashion shoe line debut party at the pool on the rd floor  We went in around pm and were seated right away  We ordered some drinks as our waiter showed up ri
 ght away to help us  The drinks took a bit to get back to us but that was okay as the in the meantime the delightful bread basket showed up   The bread basket contained a variety of breads  Good breads that I couldnt stop picking up and eating  It was accompanied by butter sprinkled in some leaves or herbs or something  It looked cute and it tasted good  Also with the butter was a small option of salt or pepper which I thought was a cute touch   Though I have never added salt and pepper to my butter  
 It was cute though   For an appetizer we had their signature antipasto dish "to share" as listed on the menu  It came with salami  nostrano prosciutto di parma mozzarella peperonata and bagnain other words lots of meat and cheeses and breads and dips  Very elegant and really good meat  Definitely something I enjoyed   For entrees we ordered the house made gnocchi sea bass and the duet of ducks  The gnocchi was my favorite but that is also what I personally ordered  It came with sausage toasted walnuts and gorgonzola  There was a cream sauce that it came in also and it was the perfect amount of cream to add the flavor that made the dish but I didnt feel like my plate was all cream and with gnocchi on the side  It was delicious perfectly cooked and with just the right amount of sausage walnuts mini asparagus and tomatoes   The sea bass also was great  Soft and placed upon a small serving of asparagus pesto noodles with some sauteed spinach sandwiched in between  Had I not orde
