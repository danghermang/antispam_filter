Dear Friend,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
My name is Capt.Steve Brown, a Captain in the&nbsp; Army now on a tour of duty in Northern Iraq. During one of our duty assignment, we stumbled on an Al-Qaeda dump site where was stacked many arms and also cashdollars to the amount of over $50 Million. We only declared the arms and kept quiet concerning the money. The money was shared among us and I being the Platoon commander got $10.7 Million. I was able to move this money out of Iraq to Bangkok Thailand through a Non Governmental Organization.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Presently the money is lodged with a Safe Keeping company. My tour is not finished and because of my status I am not eligible to possess such a huge amount of money. So I am seeking a trust worthy person who will stand as the beneficiary of this fund on my behalf and move the money to your country and hold it on trust for me until I am back from my national service.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
You will be entitled to 40% of the total sum for your assistance.Please bear in mind that this transaction is 100% risk free and also highly confidential so you need to keep it to yourself alone for security reasons because of the huge amount involve.</DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
Please respond so as to send to you further details about this transaction.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Best Regards,</DIV>
<DIV>
Capt.Steve Brown.</DIV>
