Hi Anna,

Good to hear no major problem with the tube. As far as the bathroom issue, make sure you are drinking more water than ever! The reason they always want to know if we get diarrhea is that it can dehydrate you quickly. I'm just hoping this head cold passes before my next treatment or it is gonna be a double icky week next week!Boozhoo "Hello" Dennis

Was great to hear from u. The follow up went well =) The surgeon was more understanding this time around than he has been. We did learn that they took more than we assumed. Took about a foot and some rectum that we were totally unaware of. Explains the frequent urges to the potty. 

I feel he is doin well, still struggles w/what to eat to avoid diarrhea or tacky stools. I keep on him to keep the fluids up more than he allows himself. He will get the port in May 23rd. I think he is eager to get it done, but not as eager to deal w/the sickness of the chemo. Doc says his cancer is slow growing, so that was much relief. I have started a lil note book of questions to ask the oncologist. 

We did talk a lil w/a financial aid. She was useless, gave us numbers of who we Have to deal w/far as 3 separate billings. So for now I keep tellin him lets not worry about that, lets concentrate on the health. Its not like they'll throw us in jail. I'm hopin his spirit will lift w/the weather changing so he can do what he loves most--fishing.

He will most likely get his 1st treatment the week after the port hole. The one thing that scares me is that I work at Walmart. That place is infested w/viruses & germs. I try my best to keep away from the obvious ill & hands washed continuously. I usually don't get sick, but I become a carrier in which he tends to get it. I don't want him to catch anything that will effect his health while he is being treated. Don't want him to have delays in treatments. I will note that in my question book.

I will keep u updated. Have a great weekend =)Chemo Diary - 3rd Treatment - 5/22 - Sitting in the chair getting 3rd treatment. They should serve donuts with the benadyrl i.v. 

3rd treatment underway. The cold tingles have already started as well as the 'first bite' pain. It's 95 degrees out and so making me tired already.

Talked to the doctor about why they are not drawing blood thru the medi-port. He says that drawing blood thru the plastic tube encourages clotting in the tube, and so they only like to do it when usually lab draw is not good because of small veins and such. If the tube clots you have to have it fixed which we'd rather not do. So will live with the lab draws rather than risk gunking up the port tube.Dennis,

I hope things get easier for you. I finished my chemoradiation yesterday and will have surgery in about 6 weeks. I think I am following you as far as treatment goes! lol

What are the main side effects you have so far? The cold and tingling sensations? 

You are already on #3! Time is going by fast! Best wishes and good luck! I really love the fact that you are posting your chemo journey, it makes it easier on the rest of us that will be going through it
Hi Dennis, off for my 3rd cycle tomorrow. Can't believe how close we are with treatment. I have been feeling pretty good this week so making the most of it, although I have got that sniffly nose so hope no developing into anything. My fingertips are starting to feel numb, hope its only temporary as I type for a living!!! I'll check in on Monday to see how u and me are getting on. Regards AnnaHi Y'all . . .

Yup, tingling starts the day of treatment and lasts for a few days after getting unhooked. I call that the hot week - warm yogurt and drinks and such. So far it has gone away four or so days after treatment and i have a cold week, and by then i am ready for iced lattes and ice cream! 

Other side affect has been fatigue. Again, the three or four days after the pump comes off i need several naps during the day and off to bed about 8 p.m. - but then I seem to wake up earlier than usual. So far same schedule of this going away about four days after treatment.

Nausea has not been bad, I been taking a nausea pill maybe one a day for a couple days after the pump but nothing severe.

Other side affect is gas. Lots of gas and frequent feeling that I have to make a bowel movement that just turns out to be more gas. This seems to last a little longer than the other affects.

Oh . . . and 'first bite' pain in the jaw for a couple days.

Finally, on the emotional side, I seem to get bouts of anxiety. I feel like I need to be getting things done. i think this comes from so much forced down time.

More to come . . . enjoy the day!

-Dennis
