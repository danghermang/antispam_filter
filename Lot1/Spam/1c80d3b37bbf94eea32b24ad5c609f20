 We were talking about valuing their lives. I don't think that fetus has the right to grow up and kill their mother in the 150th trimester either. Ha Ha, McCain the Same. You shouldn't treat the Dem's first choice for vice-presidential candidate (Which he declined) that way. Especially, since for the first 7 years we heard about how different he was from Bush.

In fact there isn't a Republican more different from Bush.

Larry Craig can be voted out, but he wasn't the reason for the sting. The reason for the sting was the amount of gay men going there to have sex. A huge Democrat voting block. It's "you're", dear. Never insinuated anything more than you did.

Whether or not you "want them to die" isn't the issue. If a woman is pregnant and doesn't want to be, for any reason, she has the right to terminate the pregnancy. Her reasons don't have to meet with your approval.

The reasons do not have to include her possible death. They may include her financial status, her mental or physical health, or her life circumstances. What you think about whether her reasons are valid doesn't matter a bit, since you're not the one living her life or carrying the fetus. That's the bottom line, and whether you like it or not is simply unimportant. Her life is more valuable than that of the fetus. Life isn't based on circumstances. It something someone has until they die. Am I supposed to value the life of a rich person over that of a poor person due to their "life circumstances"?

I would consider the life of someone who can cure cancer that would be pretty important. There is no way to determine if that human being has existed, but never got to finish (their life's potential) b/c their life was ended prematurely. So, I value I value all innocent human life.

Besides, by your argument, we should value the fetus more. Since the circumstances of the mother are all fixable and temporary, while the circumstance to the child is permanent death.  Believe whatever you want, honey. I disagree. The life of the woman comes first. What she decides is what counts. You don't have the cards, babe. You have no clue whether her "circumstances" are "fixable" or "temporary". And it's not necessary that you do. All that's important is what she decides. If you aren't happy about it, oh, well. You're not the one who has to live with the decision, are you? And until you are, it isn't yours to make.  Women have the right to decide whether to continue a pregnancy or to terminate it. That right is part an parcel of every citizen's right to expect privacy regarding his/her medical decisions. You can fervently assert that you believe it's wrong, but you aren't the person who's pregnant. And until you are, you don't have the right to decide for those who are
 . The courts say so, the law says so, and the majority of voters think so. Rail on. You're welcome to decry abortion all you want. It won't go away just because you want it to or think it "should". I agree that in a stable marriage, it wouldn't come to this. As for the unstable marriage? Probably best not to bring a child into it.

It is an issue that brings out complex feelings. Everyone would like to see the numbers of abortions go down, we just can't all agree on how to best accomplish that.

As for Susan Smith, I have no sympathy for her, either. I said at the time, and still maintain, that she should have been strapped into a car & thrown into a lake. But that's just me.  Uh, no. If the baby survives the abortion, it is not up to the mother or the doctor to decide if the baby receives life-saving medical attention or if it doesn't. It is up to the law. I believe that in most states a doctor who fails to provide medical care for a viable, born baby commits a felony.  You have it backwards. There's no way you can value an individual's life and another individual's "rights and privileges" equally, because without life there are neither rights nor privileges.  Google "Armanious family" and you'll understand why it's a bad idea to use your real name or give out personal information. Shame has nothing to do with it. Cowardice has nothing to do with it.  Hey, I just noticed this. Keep your hands off my swimmers, thank you very much. They have a hard enough time as it i
 s. Bitner, Susan Smith and Andrea Yates were both good mothers from all accounts. Both became mentally unhinged for different reasons and murdered their children. IMO, those poor drowned tikes would have been better off never born.

This is likely unfair, but I believe the root cause in both cases was male in origin. In the case of Yates, birth control may have saved the day.

Since the abortion rate does not seem to be dwindling, something is wrong. I would like to see mandatory sex education in the schools beginning at age 12, and strongly reinforced with open discussion of safe practice advocated at home. Those that think abstinence is advisable (and it is, but not realistic), should also be able to comfortably put their teen daughters on bc pills, just in case. Also beneficial, because periods are regulated and often times will clear the complexion. That would be my solution. It won't fly, but I keep trying.

Geesh. I think I am still pro-choice regarding the first tri, but late-term abortions is my definition of murder. Unless the mother's life is in danger, there is no validation, no excuse and barbaric beyond belief. I feel sick thinking about it.
