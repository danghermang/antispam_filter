Top U.S. official: British-Obama lies on Syrian chemical weapons 
‘preposterous’

The same apparatus which knowingly lied in 2002-2003 that Iraq had planned 
to use “weapons of mass destruction”, in order to 
justify an invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, is at it 
again. This time, however, not everyone is willing 
to be suckered by the British-orchestrated lies. The former chief of staff 
to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, Col. 
Lawrence Wilkerson (US Army-ret.), for instance, has just denounced as 
“preposterous” the present British and U.S. claims that 
Syrian President Assad is preparing to use chemical weapons against his own 
people. 

Wilkerson was Powell’s chief of staff when Powell was set up to present to 
the U.N. on 5 February 2003 the fraudulent “evidence” 
of Iraq’s alleged weapons of mass destruction (Wilkerson prepared the 
graphics Powell used in his presentation to illustrate 
the claims later revealed to be entirely fabricated, by a source called 
“Curveball”). Powell later called his presentation—based 
upon evidence supplied by Tony Blair’s government—“the worst mistake of my 
career.” 

In an interview with Russia Today 8 December Col. Wilkerson sharply 
rebuffed the charges that Syria is preparing to use chemical
weapons against its own population. Wilkerson’s remarks appeared as U.K. 
Foreign Secretary William Hague escalated the WMD 
propaganda about Syria in comments to reporters on the sidelines of the 
International Institute for Strategic Studies’ 8th 
Annual Regional Security Summit in Manama, Bahrain (which was also attended 
by Australia’s Kevin Rudd, himself a veteran of 
the WMD lies from 2002-03).

http://rt.com/news/syria-chemical-weapons-us-intelligence-574/)

Replaying the two-card trick that Tony Blair and George W. Bush played in 
2002-03 to “confirm” each other’s “intelligence”, 
aka lies, that Saddam had WMD, Hague backed up Obama’s 3 December 
histrionics on Syria’s chemical weapons, by telling reporters 
that he and the Obama administration had seen proof that the Syrian regime 
is assembling chemical and biological weapons. 

When pressed on the specifics of the evidence, Hague resorted to the same 
well-worn ruse from 2003—“intelligence sources”: 
“We absolutely cannot be specific about that because clearly those are 
intelligence sources that these things come from,” he 
blustered. “But we have seen enough evidence to know that they need a 
warning and they have received that warning.” 

Col. Wilkerson told Russia Today, “I would be highly skeptical of any of 
the intelligence rendered by the $140 billion-plus
U.S. intelligence community as to weapons of mass destruction in possession 
of another country. Period. …We have known for 
years that Syria has chemical weapons stockpiles…the fact that President 
Assad will be moving them around and preparing for
use against his own citizens within his own territory, I frankly find 
preposterous…” Wilkerson denounced as “politicised 
intelligence” the charge that the Syrian government is contemplating the 
use of chemical weapons, and warned that this is 
“preparing the ground to intervene in Syria”. He also raised the prospect 
of impeachment of President Obama in this context. 
Colonel Wilkerson appeared on a panel Sept. 21, with U.S. Congressman Rep. 
Walter Jones and Executive Intelligence Review 
magazine’s counterintelligence editor Jeffrey Steinberg, to discuss Jones’ 
House Concurrent Resolution 107, which reasserts 
the Constitutional authority of Congress alone to declare war unless the 
United States is itself directly attacked, and 
states that any President who illegally circumvents Congress—as Obama did 
in Libya and seeks to repeat in Syria—will face 
an article of impeachment.

http://cecaust.com.au/main.asp?sub=media&id=2012_09_21_pconf.html)

Also on 8 December, U.S. statesman Lyndon LaRouche, the founder of 
Executive Intelligence Review magazine, observed the 
glaringly obvious, that it makes no sense for Assad to use chemical weapons 
in an “internal” conflict, against an enemy 
that, although largely foreign, is dispersed to a significant degree within 
the Syrian population itself: “There is no 
reason why, and no advantage, no purpose, for Syria to be sucked into that 
sort of thing,” he said. 

The Citizens Electoral Council’s October-December 2012 New Citizen 
newspaper exposes the Brits and Obama’s larger war 
agenda against Russia and China, to which end Syria and Iran are proxies. 
The New Citizen also profiles Kevin Rudd’s 
ally in pushing WMD lies in 2002-03 to convince the Australian Labor Party 
to support the Iraq war, federal MP Michael
Danby, and Danby’s connections to the most rabid neo-con warmongers in 
Britain, the U.S. and Israel.
