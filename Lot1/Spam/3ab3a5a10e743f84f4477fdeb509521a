Subject:I SEEK YOUR CONSENT.

IN GOD WE TRUST.

Hello.

Of 8951 HAILTON EAST DRIVE
STERLING HEIGHTS MICHIGAN 48313 USA.

My name is Sgt. Moss Frank. I am an American soldier and am serving 

in the military with the 1st Armored Division in Iraq till date. As 

you know we are being attacked by insurgents everyday and car 

bombs/suicide bombers. However,i managed to move part of funds 

belonging to Saddam Hussein's family in 2009. The total amount is 

USD$20 Million dollars in cash mostly 100 dollar bills. This money 

has been kept somewhere outside Baghdad for some time but with the 

proposed troop in-increase by President Barrack Obama to end the war 

and make peace with Iraq militant and terrorist i am afraid that the 

money may be discovered. Hence i want to make sure that the money is 

in a safe hands pending the completion of our assignment here.

I am ready to compensate you with good percentage of this fund 

because no strings attached as Iraq is a war zone. I plan on using 

diplomatic means under diplomatic immunity-cover to ship this money 

as military cargo to a safe hand. I am contacting you with confidence 

as all arrangements for the successful delivery has been put in 

place. All i need from you is to receive the cargo from the delegated 

diplomat at your location.

I look forward to reading from you so as to extend more confidential 

details to you immediately.I really hope that i can trust.

Please you can reply me on my private email box 

usa.mofep.gov.gv@gmail.com

for security reasons for we can only call when we are out from the camp.


Yours sincerely,

Sgt. Moss Frank.
