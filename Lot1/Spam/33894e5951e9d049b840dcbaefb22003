Subject:My relationship
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very beautiful and responsive. 

I enjoy simple things. I am very good at cooking and drawing.. 
It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be ambitious, educated and with various interests. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://viliroqi.zxq.ro If you want to know me better
