<br />Greetings!
<br />
<br />We have found evidence that your account has been compromised. Presumably this was done by a keylogger or trojan, which can be used for the account names and passwords "Battle.net" - or "World of Warcraft" accounts to read, which were used on the computer or through the obtaining of account data fraud E-mails 
<br />
<br />The investigation will be continued by Blizzard administration to determine the action to be taken against your account. If your account is found violating the EULA and Terms of Use, your account can, and will be suspended/closed/or terminated. In order to keep this from occurring, you should immediately verify that you are the original owner of the account.

We will contact you again once all information has been received and thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation in resolving this account issue.
