<DIV>
This is to inform you that the International Community has received series of Complaints from Beneficiaries who are yet to receive their outstanding Contract/Inheritance Funds. The International Community has investigated this matter and was dismayed by their discovery. It was discovered that some Corrupt Government Officials had the intension of diverting your Funds to their private Accounts prior to the intervention of the International Community.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
The Team that carried out the investigation recovered some Payment Files which have not been approved for payment from the Offices of the Corrupt Government Officials which yours was inclusive. Your Payment File that was recovered contains a Letter purportedly written by you stating that you have willingly forfeited your Contract/Inheritance Funds.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
To resolve this hopeless situation, the United Nations has been authorized to handle your Payment File and based on our recommendation, your Outstanding Contract/Inheritance Funds have been credited in our Paying Bank Escrow Account in your Favor.</DIV>
<DIV>
