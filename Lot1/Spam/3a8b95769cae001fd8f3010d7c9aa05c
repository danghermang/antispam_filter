Subject:My man, I'm waiting for you
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very nice and responsive. 
I enjoy long walks in a forest, sea-shore or just a park.... 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be positive, communicative and very attentive. 

I want to love and to be loved http://caradexo.0fees.net Let's start our acquaintance
