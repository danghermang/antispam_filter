Subject:I'm unmarried
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very kind and responsive. I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, educated and very attentive. 
And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://vavuqifa.botetr.com Let's start our acquaintance
