Hello, How’re you today?</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I am Mr. Michael Mcguin. The new Director Inspection Unit/Overseas Inspection Agent in Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport Georgia. Yesterday during my first withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from oversea and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a metal trunk box. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as “MONEY IN CASH” rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges of $3,700USD.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
On my assumption according to calculation and scan annalisis, the box will contain about $2.8 to ($3 Million) and the consignment is still left in this Storage House here at the Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport Georgia till date. The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official document from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Metal Trunk box.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the director of the Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. This consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address below for quick processing and response.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Once I confirm you are the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 3-6 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery. Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want to help deliver the money to you at 80% share for you and 20% for me. If you accept my proposal, immediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to you Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 20% share.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential.</DIV>
