Subject:Worthwhile
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very kind and responsive. 
I fond of outdoor sports special cycling and skiing.. 
It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, educated and with good sense of humor. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://molazac.ruuspages.com Let's begin our acquaintance
