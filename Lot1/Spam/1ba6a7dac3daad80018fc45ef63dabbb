The italian donuts were not bad but again nothing memorable Compared to my cheesecake they were great but lets not compare mediocre with terrible  Anyway I wish I had a good experience the decor was LOVELY The service was great seated quickly and greeted but I think our server realized I didnt like our meal and didnt even ask how things were going I didnt even finish my entree and didnt even finish my dessert as well I would have appreciated it if our waitress took notice to our experience Yes we got a groupon deal but that should not decrease our service Actually even with our groupon we ended up paying $ plus for a crappy meal We anything I wanted other than the pizza  I opted for the Italian sausage  caramelized onion pizza  flat bread  Delicious We ended up sitting around and talking until pm but was not at all rushed  Service was friendly but not intrusive  Not sure if I would choose this place for lunch given the limited lunch selection but if someone suggests to meet h
 ere I wouldnt mind all that much Was this     Funny   Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Jerry L  friends  s Jerry L Mountain View CA   Seated via OpenTable The environment is good and the service is excellent They do have a Sunday supply menu which is a great value although the food that they serve might not be as great as the regular menu Was this     Funny   Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Janet O Elite   friends  s Janet O San Jose CA    photos  Checkin Here Single ladies Or Not You like men in suits? Or to quote Abby S "well groomed" men? Search no more They gather here It feels like a place where deals are made Ive been to a conference here but never to Quattro Even the name sounds like a sleek sports car Wait it is Reminiscent of the Audi Hmmmsleek indeed Came with Teresa P for lunch and our usual weekly catch up chat She had the Prosecco and I had a Riesling Yes we drink for lunch Shared a clu
 b sandwhich that was really good Service was fast and friendly I love the little nooks where you can sit relax and sip your choice of wines from their list I love my Riesling It was as what <br><Br>
the server saidfar from being dry  This was one of Teresa Ps many places her hubby took her to for one of those special nights And she turned around and took me Hot Lol Im lucky to be have my senses intrigued by Teresa P again  Salud Woman Feel better Thanks for another intro again Was this   Funny Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Jenn D  friends  s Jenn D Hayward CA   I bought a Travelzoo deal and since the expiration date was getting close my husband and I decided to go on a weekday instead of the weekend Since there was no one to watch our toddler last night we brought him along with us The ambiance of the place is nice Windows all around so you get the natural lights coming down There is also a patio area if you wanted to eat outside Now when I made my reservation I didnt include my toddler Since hes still small we just have him sit on our laps So when we arrived the hostess was going to make us wait for a table but at dinner time it wa
 s a bit packed She told us that there was a booth and we told her that was totally fine It was big enough The thing I did notice later on was that there was no children that was my sons age  and a half years The children there were a bit older Maybe they were concerned that he would act up or something They gave my toddler a coloring book crayons and a beanie baby key chain Ive never seen any restaurants give a key chain before After our night was over our waitress said that our toddler was very well behaved which he was Anyway so onto dinner Emily our waitress told us that the dishes were like a tasting menu Basically think small portions With the Travelzoo we got  antipastis  secondis  dolcis and two sparkling wine Now on their menu they do have a course for $ or course for $ The service was good and Emily was attentive She remembered our orders and made sure that none of our dishes had nuts because our son has a nut allergy So I got the Tonno Tonnato pacific albacore tuna
 green onioncapersgarlic chips kobesytle masami beef kohlrabi fondanttorepedo onioncherry glaceblack pepper jus and mocha almond fudge "sundae" Everything was good The antipasti Tonna Tonnato had a tang to it which might have been the capers My husband got the chilled pea soup snap peastoasted bionchespice creme fraiche organic chicken meyer lemon confitfenneltaggiasche onion and the ricotta cheese cake proseccostrawberry salad He liked everything but the dessert He thought the dessert was soso My toddler liked the organic chicken Emily told me that the chef wanted us to know that the desserts were exposed to nuts so instead we got a bowl of fruits for him which was $  Now youre probably wondering about the bill Well it is expensive there if you had what we had last night Each course has its own fix price on the menu and the menu <br><Br>does say which one has an additional price Ex all the secondi food are $ except the kobestyled masami beef which is $ more $ Wine was $ and 
 water was $ not tap water So without the Travelzoo deal it would have been $ this included the tax only With the Travelzoo deal $ for a $ value we had $ left over so instead the total came out to be $ with tip Overall we had a good experience Its a good place for small groups and dates I would come again with friends Was this   Funny   Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from lilli g  friends  s lilli g Oakland CA   The vibe of the dining area is hip and modern Wesque and not what youd expect from a four seasons The scene  a lot of people dining probably on the companys dollar Music and noise level  LOUD THe service spectacular and not stuffy But the food was simply meh from a simple steak to shrimp I could do better out of my own kitchen Probably a better bar experience than dining If they could improve upon the food id definitely go back Was this   Funny   Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Veronica S Elite 
   friends  s Veronica S Fremont CA    Checkins Here i was impressed with their consolidated but solid cocktail menu at their lounge and bar About  drinks to choose from all at a pricey tag of $ but all crafted to perfection They also offer olivesnuts to snack on in the lounge great complement to the drinks The dining room here is always pretty consistent and Quattro also participates in "Dine About Town" so if you want to try it on a budget its good to take advantage of that promotion They offer Breakfast Lunch Dinner and "Intermezzo"  a menu with appetizers and Hors doeuvres to snack on in between lunch & dinner or postdinner Great for small groups dates business meetings Was this   Funny   Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Zoom Z  friends  s Zoom Z Mountain View CA   Outside one pretty awful appetizer the meal was solid and the waitstaff were professional I would rate the meal at  stars but since they professional Ill bump it up to four
  stars Like many other procrastinators I used my Travelzoo voucher I had Salmon crudo very good flavors all around would recommend and eat again Hawaiian Ono Wahoo quite a few pieces of fish with two large shrimp in a tomato based sauce Very filling and hearty I think Ono has a meatier texture so if you are expecting flaky and delicate  best to probably not have this Bombolini about  small friend and sugared donut holes with chocolate and salted caramel dipping sauce on the side This was very well done The donuts were light fluffy hot and not oily and the dipping sauces were very complimentary My friend had Tuna tonno AVOID The tun was fine but the sauce over it was oversalted Should have <br><Br>sent back Chicken my friend thought the chicken and heirloom tomatoes and vegetables were very good Another sizeable portion Personally I thought it was moist but an ultimately rather boring dish Tiramisu very good would recommend if you like tiramisu Not a very traditional wedge ca
 ke presentation though Since I dont drink I gave my dining partner the two alcoholic beverages He tried the Prosecco interestingly the J sparkling wine was not offered  has better online s and the waitperson suggested that he could substitute a glass of wine instead of a second glass of sparkling wine My friend got a glass of pinot noir over dinner I ended up drinking a $ iced tea at least it included refills Do note that if you want to have tap water  ask for tap water or they will charge you for "still" water I think that is not very professional Thank you to previous Yelp ers for alerting me to this tactic Verdict Really would give the restaurant  stars overall The threecourse $ option is not a bad value I would like to try Sunday supper for the limited threecourse for $ Was this     Funny Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Michelle P  friend  s Michelle P Los Altos CA  Updated   After I posted my followup  I immediately received anothe
