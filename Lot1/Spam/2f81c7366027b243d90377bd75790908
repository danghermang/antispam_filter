Subject:I want to say
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very pretty and generous. 

I adore kids, and I feel that it is time to have my own children.. 
It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be serious, reliable and with various interests. 
I want to love and to be loved http://zayabito.yaraho.com Let's begin our acquaintance
