Sadly enough, the cancerous cells are mutating quite fast as well, I hope they'd be able to find a way of altering their method to cover all cancer types, or at least various mutated forms.
I'm a mere layman though and would be happy if someone will prove me wrong.

The two were known as?<em>The Fabulous Beekman Boys</em>?because they starred in their own reality series for two seasons on Discovery's Planet Green. The show was canceled in 2011.</p>
<p>Josh and Brent have the dubious honor of joining Season 11's Eric and Danielle, and Season 18's Kisha and Jen as the only teams who've won the whole?<em>Race</em>?without winning a leg all season.</p>

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2009) In quantum mechanics, a
 doublet is a
 quantum state of a system with a spin of 1/2, such that there are two allowed values of the spin component, 1/2 and +1/2. Quantum systems with two possible states are sometimes called two-level systems. Essentially all

 occurrences of doublets in nature arise from rotational
 symmetry; spin 1/2 is associated with the fundamental representation of the Lie group SU(2), the group that defines rotational symmetry in three-dimensional space. History and applicationsThe term &quot;doublet&quot;
 dates back to the 19th century, when it was observed that certain spectral lines of an ionized, excited
 gas would split into two under the influence of a strong magnetic field, in an effect known
 as the anomalous Zeeman
 effect. Such spectral lines were observed not only in the laboratory, but also in astronomical spectroscopy observations, allowing astronomers to deduce the
 existence of,
 and measure the strength

 of magnetic fields around the sun, stars and galaxies. Conversely, it was the observation of doublets in spectroscopy that allowed physicists to deduce that the electron had a spin, and that furthermore, the magnitude of the
 spin
 had to be 1/2. See the history
 section of the
 article on spin (physics) for greater detail.Doublets continue to play an important role in physics.
