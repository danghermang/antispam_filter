Subject:Did you hear about the PayPal insider?
Hey,

Former PayPal insider, Steven Rounds, was the guy who
sat, and watched as normal people filled their PayPal
accounts with millions of dollars... 

That was his job... he was the guy at PayPal who was
responsible for freezing, limiting, and even closing
those accounts for good... 

He was a true PayPal insider, and he knows who really 
made money, and he knows exactly where all that money
was coming from too... 

After doing a little "research" on the biggest PayPal
accounts, he found something interesting... something
most of them had in common.

Now look, this guy obviously knows a lot of about how
money is being made online... that's what PayPal paid
him to do. 

Well, Steven isn't with PayPal anymore... 

He's a free man, and his non-disclosure agreement has
just recently expired, leaving him free to share what
he learned about the PayPal accounts he used to watch
like a hawk...

Now look, even though he's not at PayPal anymore, I'm 
sure their people know what he's saying... and, after 
hearing it for myself, I can't imagine they are going
to let him keep talking... 

If I were you, I'd check this out before PayPal legal
gets their paperwork in order, and sends Steven a big
and nasty cease and desist notice...

Thanks & Good Luck,
