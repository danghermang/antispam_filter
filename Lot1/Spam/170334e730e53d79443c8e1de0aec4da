Subject:My Happiness - it's you
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very nice and responsive. 
I enjoy long walks in a forest, sea-shore or just a park.... It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be positive, educated and with various interests. 
I want to love and to be loved http://ybehlosu.5ballov.ru Let's start our acquaintance
