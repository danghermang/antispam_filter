 Good Day To You,


 My name is Sgt Joey Jone, i am an American soldier, i am serving in
 the military of the 1st Armored Division in Iraq, we have just been
 posted to leave Iraq and go back to Germany. I am now in Kuwait at the 
 mean
 time, I and my superior moved funds seized from Saddam Hussein, the
 total is $25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five million US dollars) this money is 
 being
 kept safe in a security company.

 Basically since we are working for the government we cannot keep these
 funds,but we want to transfer and move the funds to you, so that you
 can keep it for us in your safe account or an offshore account. We will
 divide the total funds in three ways, since we are 3 that is involved.

 This means that you will take 30%, I will take 30% ,and my superior 
 will take 30%.
 10% will be kept aside for expenses.This business is confidential, and 
 it
 should not be discussed with anyone.

 There is no risk involved whatsoever. If you are interested i will send
 you the full details, my job is to find a good partner that we can
 trust and that will assist us. Can i trust you? When you receive this
 letter,kindly send me an e-mail signifying your interest including your 
 most
 confidential telephone/fax numbers for quick communication also your 
 contact details.



 This business is risk free. Respectfully submitted
