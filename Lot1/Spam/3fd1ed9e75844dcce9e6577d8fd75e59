Subject:Everything will be fine
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very beautiful and generous. 

I enjoy simple things. I am very good at cooking and drawing.. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be ambitious, communicative and with good sense of humor. I want to love and to be loved http://lalekupi.exxl.pl Let's start our acquaintance
