Subject:So in love
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and romantic. 

I always try to keep myself in a good shape.. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, educated and very attentive. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://livizuy.aussie-hosting.info If you want to know me better
