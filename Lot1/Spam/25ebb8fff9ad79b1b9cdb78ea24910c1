Subject:I am a young girl
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very nice and romantic. I am keen on sports. Sports play a very significant role in my life, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, educated and with good sense of humor. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://tapizuca.crystal-hosting.org Let's start our acquaintance
