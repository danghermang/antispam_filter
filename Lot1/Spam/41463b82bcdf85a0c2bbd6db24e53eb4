we wouldnt need them to cut it for us She said okay and took the box to the kitchen  Not  minutes later the waiter comes up to me and asks if I was the one with the cakes he inquires as he is holding the box of pastries I say yes and he informs me that the restaurant has a no outside food policy and usually they charge $ per piece of outside food brought it So with the  little pieces of cake I brought in they would have to charge me $ Basically he said he could take the box of pastries back to the kitchen and charge me the $piece of cake or I could take it back to the car and leave it there because the restaurant has its own pastries and bringing in outside ones is undermining the restaurants food Did I mention that NOWHERE did I see any sign or statement saying there was a no outside food policy? This is where my mood went from celebratory to sour When people decide to eat at a fine dining establishment they are usually not trying to pinch pennies I was not bringing in my ow
 n cakes so I wouldnt have to purchase their desserts I brought it because thats what people usually do when they eat out for someones birthday  they bring a frickin cake I did it because my mother wouldve enjoyed it PLUS everyone at dinner was already planning on ordering Quattros  course menu which includes their damn dessert anyway so its not like we were planning on skipping dessert to eat our own I sincerely expected more from Four Seasons restaurant than an ultimatum to either pay $ for $ worth of pastries or to take that shit back to my car Anyway I ended up taking it back to the car The rest of the  courses of dinner were spent with my best celebratory face on but I know I came off as extremely rude Whatever They were rude to me so I am rude back The kicker is the rd course came around and it was bread pudding Everyone got a piece because we all ordered the  courses Then the restaurant had the audacity to bring my mother a SECOND piece of bread pudding with a single c
 andle and "Happy Birthday Mom" on it Seriously? You just served my mother a second piece of the SAME EXACT dessert right after she just ate a piece of that same damn dessert I think it was safe to assume that the restaurant didnt even have other dessert options available yet they STILL did not allow me to bring in little pieces of cake for my moms birthday Why they were making sure a big frickin deal over those stupid pieces of cake and then making themselves look ridiculous by trying to come off as thoughtful is beyond me Needless to say I was shocked and so turned off by this gesture  Anyway if youre looking to find a nice restaurant to celebrate a birthday a graduation an anniversary or Valentines day DO NOT COME HERE Apparently celebrating is not okay Was this   Funny Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a

"Why yes Yes they are thank you very much Miguel" as I coyly read our servers name tag  cue boss nod of approval here You get a well deserved cuatro stars from me Quattro Was this   Funny Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Jas S  friends  s Jas S San Francisco CA   This is  is for Sunday Supper amazing value for $  Food an service were  stars 
 considering the price  For the December menu get the bean soup  fantastic  The green lasagna is misleading it actually bolognese with wide green homemade pasta and cheese it too was outstanding  The restaurant is a bit "cold" feeling so if youre looking for a cozy romantic spot probably stick near the bar instead of the dinning room  Sundays tend to draw families so also expect some kid action which is not bad but somewhat loud running around etc Will be coming back for Sunday Supper again Was this     Funny Cool   Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from Lisa R Elite   friends  s Lisa R Walnut Creek CA  Updated    photos The manager contacted me regarding my experience and he said he would look into implementing some changes I greatly appreciate that management takes the time to respond to customers Was this     Funny Cool    Previous  Show all » Amazing desserts which is a big deal to me bc dessert is my favorite part of the day I highly… Read more »

Let me first say the wine was amazing never had such expensive wine before Dessert white wine Wow So many layers  Tasted like apple juice at first then had a sparkle then had that winey WINE taste then was really sweet then was STILL fruity It didnt taste like alcohol because that usually sharp biting strong punch of alcohol wasnt strong at all  AMAZING 

What was it called again I took a picture of one of the bottles Wow Cant wait to try others Get the  course meals You get to try a lot  Oh I forget all of the names Dont feel like looking everything up but I dont want to butcher all the food with my bad english I was warned that the chicken liver pate was really savery and strong but it was good Reminded me of when I was young and always wanted the liver from the chickenbut my mom would forget and just throw it out  Anyways the sturgeon fish was wrapped in bacon and light I guess The dessert looked like chocolate lava cake but i forget the name Well my favorite part of the meal was the wine  And its not even Napa  I wonder what Napa will be like when I finally go there and do the intended purpose of wine tasting Wow cant wait  I love wine now  NO MORE BEER Listed in You will leave STUFFED~ Was this     Funny   Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This   from maria c  friends  s maria c Mountain View CA   I
