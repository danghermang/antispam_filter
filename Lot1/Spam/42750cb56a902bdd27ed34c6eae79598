                <b>"Many Afghans are already bracing themselves for an eventual return of the 
Taliban."However, Cummings added, "It's important that this context be understood and extremely 
important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more 
than 20,000 interrogations of several thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees at 
the Bagram base.It also details the strong links between the Taliban and 
Pakistan -- especially its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, according to newspaper 
report."The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. ISI is 
thoroughly aware of Taliban activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban 
personnel. Senior Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on 
strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of Pakistan," the 
report read."ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad [holy war] andcome to the conclusion that the extremists have been in charge," he 
said, noting that when he gets his message straight to the people, 
he gets a good reception.Paul said he also picked up support when 
Rick Perry and Herman Cain left the contest."He had a little bit 
more legitimacy about being Tea Party, because he had not been in 
government, and you know, his arguments were a little bit more credible. 
So, our percentages, that's when they took a nice little jump," Paul 
said.But poll numbers do help frame the debate over invincibility, and with 
Romney holding a double-digit lead in Florida, and a strong position in 
national polls, as well as having considerable money in the bank, knocking 
him off his perch will be hard to do.That's why Gingrich has 
repeatedly suggested that Santorum get out of the race, saying that between 
the two of them, they poll better than Romney.But Santorum said that's 
not happening, and Gingrich shouldn't even ask.I don't think people oters and Which Ones?In 2008, there were 1.95 million Republican primary votes 
cast in Florida. Pollsters and pundits disagree on whether there will be 
more or fewer this time around, and, more importantly, which regions of 
the state will turn out most heavily.There are some signs of a 
much higher turnout than last time. Not only is the race hotter, 
but weve seen turnout increases in the three previous nominating contests. While 
the growth was modest in Iowa and New Hampshire, the January 21 
South Carolina primary shattered all Republican records in the state with a 
35 percent increase over 2008.In Florida, there has been a surge in 
early and absentee ballots with some 600,000 votes already cast  about 
100,000 more than 2008, a 20 percent increase. Some of that represents 
voters becoming increasingly familiar with Floridas permissive voting laws and some reflects 
an unprecedented push for early voters by the Romney campaign (a Miami

        <span><b>KABUL, Afghanistan  The international military coalition in Afghanistan says a man 
wearing an Afghan army uniform has shot and killed a NATO service 
member.Tuesday's killing in southern Afghanistan is the latest in a rising number 
of cases in which an Afghan soldier or a militant dressed as 
one has turned his weapon against foreign troops.NATO did not provide any 
other details.After an Afghan soldier killed four French soldiers on Jan. 20, 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced France would speed up its exit and 
ask NATO to hand over all combat operations to Afghan forces in 
2013 instead of by the end of 2014.The Pentagon says that while 
the number of cases of Afghans killing their international partners is rising, 
it does not appear to be a widespread problem.</b></span>
