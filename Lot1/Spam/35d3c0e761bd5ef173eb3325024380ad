Subject:Re: Confirm receipt....
Dear Friend,


Compliments of the day and God's blessings


I am glad to inform you that I have successfully concluded the
transaction, the funds was transferred to London. It was transferred
through the assistance of a new found partner from UK. Currently I am in
London with him.


However, I did not forget you because you are the source of my success,
you made me what I am now though you are not there to complete this
project with me but I give all the credit and thanks to you. I know it was
not your fault or rather your wish to back off on me and the transaction,
I understood it was simply because of what you must have heard about
Africa and her business opportunities. Actually there are still good ones.


In appreciation of your assistance, I have mapped out a compensation sum
and written in your favor a bank Draft worth of US$3.7000,000.00.(Three
Million seven hundred thousand United States Dollars Only) I left the
Draft with my counsel, Barr.Jamal Nafad on my departure to London. I
would like you therefore, to contact him on the below information, and
give him your physical address where he should deliver the bank draft to
you. Kindly contact him because I have told him about you.


Name: Barr. Jamal Nafad 

Email: jamalnafad2@yahoo.com.hk


Contact my cancel with the above contact information, so that he will send
your Draft to you. I will stop here,Once again thank you very much and
remain blessed.
