Subject:I feel bad without you
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very kind and responsive. 

I enjoy long walks in a forest, sea-shore or just a park.... 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be ambitious, communicative and very attentive. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://xadopalu.worthlessorwonderful.com Let's begin our acquaintance
