    Dear ,<br />
    We need your help resolving an issue with your account. To give us time to<br />
    work together on this, we've temporarily limited what you can do with your<br />
    account until the issue is resolved.<br />
    <br />
    We understand it may be frustrating not to have full access to your PayPal<br />
    account. We want to work with you to get your account back to normal as<br />
    quickly as possible.<br />
    <br />
    What's the problem?<br />
    <br />
    We want to check with you to make sure that no one has logged in to your<br />
    account without your permission.<br />
    <br />
    Please take a moment to change your password, create new security<br />
    questions,update your peronal and money info. You should also take a look at your <br />
  recent transactions. Activate your account by clicking at the link: <a href="http://doctorgasmo.com/images/medium/icone/update/">Go To Your
Account</a><br />
    <br />
    If you see a payment that you don't recognize, let us know by going to the<br />
    Resolution Center.  Click &quot;Dispute a Transaction&quot; to report an unauthorized<br />
    transaction.<br />
