Subject:PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENT
Hello Friend,

This message might meet you in utmost surprise however, it's just my 
urgent need for a foreign partner that made me contact you for this 
transaction, My name is Mr. Williams Park, I am a banker by profession 
and I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of 
us, as an officer in my Bank; it is my duty to send in a financial 
report to my Head Office in the end of each business year.

On the course of last two year 2010 business report, I discovered that 
my branch in which I am rank officer made Six Million Five  hundred 
Thousand United State Dollars ($6,500.000.00) which my Head Office are 
not aware of and will never be aware of it. I have placed this fund on 
SUSPENSE ACCOUNT with no beneficiary. As an officer of this bank i 
cannot be directly connected to this money, this informed my contacting 
you.

Indeed I will appreciate if you can receive this money in your bank 
account and get 30% of the total funds. There are practically no risks 
involved, it is simple bank to bank transfer, all I need from you is to 
stand claim as one of our customer who has been banking with us and the 
depositor of this funds with my branch, so that upon your request for 
its immediate transfer my head Office will not hesitate to transfer to 
your designated bank account.

I will give you more details once I hear from you declaring your 
interest to cooperate with  me.

Yours Sincerely,
Mr. Williams Park
