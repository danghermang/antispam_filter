Dear Partner,

My name is Franky Meersman an auditor with a bank here. During the course
of our auditing, I discovered an account pened with one of the branches of
the bank since the year 1996. This account was functional and operative
until August ending 2001, when the last withdrawal of (£23,000)
twenty-three thousand British Pounds Sterling was
made from it via transfer request to Europe . This leaves the balance of
(£65.000.000)Sixty-five Million British Pounds Sterling.

From the cash withdrawal requisition he made through the offshore payment
office in Europe , it was discovered that Mr. Hans Daniel and family are
billed for holiday in United States Of America By first week of September.
It is
strongly believed that, Mr. Hans Daniel and family was victim of world
trade center incident of September 11 2001 . Now, the bank will release
this money to any foreigner that forwards claims as next of kin to Mr.
Hans Daniel provided that the person has useful information and necessary
documents.

It is a fact that I do not know you before; my reason to look for your
address through directory, was this need to use a foreigner like
you.Importantly, I will provide funds to cover all local expenses to
procure legal documents in your name. Please indicate your interest to
work with me, by reply to this mail. Full action plan will be made
available. meersmanfranky@ymail.com Call me for explanation 44-7045709908
Yours faithfully,
Franky Meersman
