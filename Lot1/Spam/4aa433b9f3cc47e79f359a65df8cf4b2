This sounds to me as if you may be irritating the Urethra when you masturbate or have rough sex. 
The Urethra can be hyper-sensitive in a healthy percentage of men, frequent alcohol consumption can also further the problem.
Abstinance from masturbation may temporarily ease the problem, but it will only return afterwards.
Experimentation is the key - try some lubricant which is absorbed by the skin and may help to de-sensitize the Urethra.

-Dr T.I have problems urinating, it started over a year ago. I have the frequent urge to urinate. that can be anywhere from every half hour to ever 2 hours.

I also have had a lot of problems going. I stopped being able to urinate for a while, and went to the emergency room. Where they couldn't get a cathater in me.

I was diagnosed with a possible urinary tract infection, and given cyparo, antibiotic. This seemed to work wonderfully for about 2 weeks. It allowed me to urinate and have stools. As I had also become chronically constipated, after 30 years of having diarriah. The cyparo stopped working after about 2 weeks. And the urinary and constipation problem returned.An update guys: I'm still suffering the same frequent urge to pee. I don't masturbate or have sex too frequently, usually once/week. I've found that sometimes it gets better and sometimes worse afterwards. I have found that cranberry pills did not help. I have been trying the broccoli diet and it may help but it is hard to stay on it with having to drink the juice every morning and night for a month and boil it properly, etc. I noticed that sometimes my semen has small gel-like clumps in it, suggesting that there may be some kind of inflammation- I don't know if it is non-bacterial or bacterial, but every trip to the urolog
 ist has come up negative for blood, white blood cells, or infections. It has now been over 1 year since the symptoms first started and I am starting to wear down. My wife does not understand how difficult it makes it for me to concentrate at work and then come home and try to sit further. Standing and excercise definitely help, but I think this is because the water in the body is diverted to sweat so that there is less in the bladder to cause the urge in the prostate. Also, exercise can temporarily reduce localized inflammation. Advil helps a bit but it comes back with a vengeance after I go off the Advil, sometimes worse than before I took it. I heard that NIH actually has investigated this issue and quite honestly, a look at the literature shows very little success in finding out if there is a common factor or if it is caused by a host of factors. My urologist says it is quite common among men in the 40's but I am a little bit early in my early 30's, although it is not unh
 eard of for someone in this age. He wants me to take levoquin just to make sure it isn't a bacterial infection. however, there are so many people online talking about levaquin destroying their joints, I am anxious about taking it if there is no proof. I hope some of you guys are finding relief, and for those who aren't, keep updating on what does not work or worksHey people i'm having the same problem.I used to have this problem before what helped me most was drinking UVIN tea a disqusting tea which helps with this problem.I told my parents and their opinion is that this happened to me because i have a cold on my stomach.That doesn't make any logic to me but UVIN tea helped me and i am drinking it again so i hope this will help you out.
All the bestHey forum,

I just wanted to put my 2 cents in. I didnt at first realise how bad my need to urinate often was untill i went to the movies with a couple friends who were kind enough to point out how many times a went to the toilet. Very embarrassing.

So, i began to worry. First i guessed diabetes, then some urinary tract infection, prostate cancer, kidney failure/problem (as i had recently used steriods, making things much more stressful). Instead of going to a doctor like a reasonable person, i consulted to eternal tome of knowledge that is a mans father. 

Long story short, he noticed that from about the age of 14-15 i began going to the toilet more often, especially at night. It is also around that age i began to masturbate. I then realised the symptoms were worse at night because.... well its obvious from here.

Therefore my advice is:

1. tell someone who cares, dont let it eat you up and stress you out.
2. rule out serious issues, especially prostate cancer (point 1 will lead you here).
3. if the problem persists you are using your **** too often, its irritated put the **** away go fishing, read a book..

Hope you find comfort in my story. Good Luck!
