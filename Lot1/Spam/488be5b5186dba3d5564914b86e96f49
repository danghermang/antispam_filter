Attention Sir,

Iam Mr. Allasson Issa,the Head of file Department in Standard bank Plc London.I hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust,and confidence that iam about to repose on you for the mutual benefits of our both families.I needed your urgent assistance in transfering the sum of ($14.5) million U.S Dollars into your bank account.

The huge sum of money has been unclaimed,and the account has been dormant for years in our bank here without anybody coming for it as a claim.I want to release the fund to you as the nearest person to our deceased customer (the owner of the fund,and the dormant account) who died a long with his supposed next of kin in an air crash few years ago.

I don't want the fund to go into our bank treasury account as unclaimed fund.So,this is the main reason why i have contacted you,so that we will release the fund to you as the nearest person to the deceased customer ( next of kin).Please,i would like you to keep this proposal as a top secret or delete it if you are not interested.

Upon receipt of your reply,i will send to you the full details on how the business will be executed,and an official copy of the 'Application Form Of Claim' of which you will fill,and send to the bank for the release of the fund into your recieving bank account.

Also,note that our sharing ratio will be 50% for me and 40% for you. While 10% will be for the necessary expenses that might occur along the line.I won't fail to bring to your notice that the risk to be taken is 100% free in this transaction, and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer of the fund into your bank account.Please,don't ever forget to reply me this email very urgent.

Looking forward to receive your reply urgently.All corresponding email will come to my private email for security reasons,here is my email: allasanissa@yahoo.com

Thank's from,
Mr. Allasson Issa.
