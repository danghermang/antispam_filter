MALAYSIAN PAY-OUT CENTER

Attention Beneficiary,
We wish to inform you that the United Nations (UN) has taken over the 
Inheritance/Prize Winning payment issue which you currently or previously 
had with your transaction agents. Your funds was withdrawn by UN on your 
behalf based on the fact that you where subjected to too many processes that 
will make you spend more money before receiving your funds.

Your Inheritance/Winning payment was paid out to the United Nations Organization, 
and they have succeeded in depositing your funds with us. They have ordered 
Western Union to take full responsibility in the transfer process of your funds, and we
 have received your application for the first installment of $7,600 USD from the total 
amount of $1,500,000.00 USD, One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars.

For some security reasons, we need you to reconfirm your Name, Address, Age and Phone 
Number before receiving the MTCN for the first installment, and we will email you others 
after 24 hours of receiving each payment.
E-mail Dr.Vinsen Chin @ wunion2011@zh8844.com
