Hi,

My name is Lt. Shannon kilkoyne a member of the U.S. ARMY Task Force 38's
B Company, 3rd Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment, Iraq.I would like to
share some highly personal classified information about my personal
experience and role which I played in the pursuit of my career, though you
might be surprise to read this from a total stranger like me.

However, I will hold back certain information for security reasons for now
until you have found the time to visit the website stated below to enable
you have an insight into what I intend sharing with you for our benefits

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/27/pentagon-cant-account-for_n_660652.html

Please, confirm if you have visited the two sites then I will be more
vivid and coherent in my next massage because I need to confide in someone
on my findings as i urgently await your response. I will want your
thoughts via my email urgently due to the fact that i am suppose to be in
the USA with the last batch of troops that just left Iraq for the final
evacuation but I was redeployed to Iraq under the Task Force 38's B
Company that will end by this October 2011.

Thanks,
Lt. Shannon kilkoyne.
