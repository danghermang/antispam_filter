Ah, I remember that too - we always got fresh linens for spring/summer and then switched them out in the fall/winter. I always looked forward to it as a kid. But again, maybe because our walls were white we could do this? I'm currently Ah, I remember that too - we always got fresh linens for spring/summer and then switched them out in the fall/winter. I always looked forward to it as a kid. But again, maybe because our walls were white we could do this? I'm currently painting all my walls here white and so far, I like it. Going from a LRV of 11 to one of 73 has energized this space.Hi Everyone,
My husband and I are purchasing a new house that needs some updating. There is a lot of dark real wood paneling (oak maybe?) on the walls. The house is a colonial style outside, tons of huge windows, built in 1977, 9ft ceilings on the main level, and large rooms. The house really hasn't been updated at all.

I have a love/hate relationship with the paneling. It is gorgeous in it's own right. But it lends itself to feeling more rustic, which isn't necessarily my style. My current home is a very traditional home (neighborhood setting) with medium stained maple woodwork, which I love. The new home is on wooded acreage so the setting is entirely different.

I'm trying to figure out a way to find the happy medium between maintaining the character and charm in the house and yet modernize it enough that my furniture doesn't just make it look odd.

I do not want to paint the woodwork, as I love stained...and I can't bring myself to painting the walls. I've had a couple of contractors looks at the paneling and they thought it was probably custom made and appears to be like 3/4' thick. It's definitely not cheap. The contractors recommended we sell the paneling, if we decide to remove it. There is an abundance of natural sunlight (6 6ft tall windows and 2 6ft sliders in the main living space), so it doesn't feel dark or 'cave-like'. So that's not an issue. And the main living area, which will be the eating area and great room, is approximately 25'x48'.

To add to the equation, I'm going to be renovating the kitchen and it's going to be open to the main living area. Currently it has the original oak kitchen cabinets. I just don't care for the oak. I have the opportunity to purchase new cabinets at an insane discount...unfortunately I have limited choices in stain colors so it's going to be a different color hue than what's currently installed. But it doesn't make sense to spend 5X's what I'm going to pay for cabinets to get another brand (we'll have about 120 linear ft of cabinets)...I would rather spend that money in some other updates to the house.

So my questions are as follows...any recommendations on how to bring some modern life into the living area with the paneling? Is there anyway to cover the paneling without making it permanent or destroying it? Any ideas on what to do, if you keep the paneling and end up with a cherry wood kitchen cabinets, on how to transition between the two areas and not look weird? Any input is greatly appreciated! Sorry for the long post :)t's a lovely room...so large and bright.
I can see where the paneling can feel overwhelming, though it is beautiful. I also don't see how, even if you eliminate the paneling, you're going to get totally away from the rustic feel with that wood stove.

You can leave the paneling and treat the room as if the walls were painted brown. Part of the issue I think is the stark contrast with the rug and the ceiling. If you get some more color in there, it will soften the brown. Once you add window treatments, wall art and furniture, I think it will be fine. You said your old house was traditional, so I'm assuming you have traditional furniture which can work here....you can blend of traditional and country colonial as certainly they were contemporary with each other. (Frankly I prefer an eclectic mix of styles rather than sticking rigidly with one as it makes a room more relaxed.)f you can't deal with the paneling, you certainly could have it removed. But then I think you'd have a large room, just like every other colonial....

You can do things like bring in book cases to look like built-ins to cover some of the walls.

You could have the walls quilted ($$$) and it could probably be done with a minimum amount of damage to the paneling underneath...a few holes where they tack up wooden strips. You could try temporary wallpaper, though the texture will still show through, you can change the look dramatically. I've had no experience with this, so can't vouch for removability. I've seen people put fabric on walls using liquid starch which is later very removable, but I have no idea what the starch might do to the paneling over the long term...and you'll still have the seams. You also have the option of doing 1 or 2 walls only and leaving the rest.
