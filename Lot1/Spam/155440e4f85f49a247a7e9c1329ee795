Subject:No problem
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very kind and romantic. 

I like sea and sun. I adore just laying under the sun and receive sunbathes.. 
It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, reliable and very attentive. 
And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://yaxogib.phpnet.us Let's start our acquaintance
