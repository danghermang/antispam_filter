 oven and it is

whatever it is at least its got size and heft Coming from the East Coast many places here that claim to be New York Style pizza doesnt really seem so so I cant really be sure that other claims like being Chichago-style are also accurate  But whatever BF and I got pizza to go from here for an impromptu house gathering  The pizza comes with a lot on it - A LOT   Service is friendly  Weve only ever gotten take-out from here but the restaurant itself looks like it can get busy at dinner too Theres a wide range of vegetarian pizzas too yay and ordering online is really convenient and simple too Was this review  		Useful   		Funny   		Cool   		 		 Add

medium sized pizza is actually cheaper than Mountain Mikes and tastes WAY better  The decor in the restaurant is very Chicago-themed with lots of references to Chicago sports teams Plus one of the most unique features is that they serve your drinks in a Mason jar Very cool I cant say enough about how excellent this restaurant is A+ for quality A+ for taste And A+ for service But dont take my word for it: go there try the pizza You wont be disappointed Was this review  		Useful   		Funny   		Cool   		 		 Add   		 Bookmark 		 Send to a Friend 		 Link to This Review		 		 		Review from Michelle W 		 		Elite  		  friends 		  reviews 		Michelle W 		 Union City CA 		 		   Its so good Im inspired to write a haiku: Oooooo Deep Dish Pizza You Are A Taste Of Heaven Me Love You Long Time *hugz* Was this review  		Useful  		Funny  		Cool  		 		 Add   		 Bookmark 		 Send to a Friend 		 Link to This Review		 		 		Review from Karen N 		 		  friends 		  reviews

enough to call ahead and order a few pizzas in the morning for lunch time delivery The pizzas were a bit pricey but they were loaded with toppings and had a nice thick crust I personally prefer Italian style thin crust though Was this review  		Useful   		Funny   		Cool   		 		 Add   		 Bookmark 		 Send to a Friend 		 Link to This Review		 		 		Review from Chris F 		 		  friends 		  reviews 		Chris F 		 San Jose CA 		 		   Melt-in-your-mouth crust isnt what I would normally describe pizza crust but here at Pizza Chicago that description fits perfectly well After getting over the fact that youll be eating one big hunk of a pizza pie filled with cheesy goodness and great ingredients you cant help but fall in love with the soft pillowy

and crunchy crust Im not normally a pizza crust person but this pizza just makes me want to eat everything - including the crust Chug everything down with a huge glass of soda out of a Mason jar and youre all set The restaurant is kinda small but decorated nicely with everything that has to do with Chicago Service is always great and friendly It is definitely a great pizza place in an unassuming part of Santa Clara across the street from Luckys Listed in: Top Restaurants  Was this review  		Useful  		Funny   		Cool  		 		 Add   		 Bookmark 		 Send to a Friend 		 Link to This Review		 		 		Review from eric k 		 		  friends 		  reviews 		eric k 		 Dublin CA 		 		   I dont know if it was just this place or what I remember
