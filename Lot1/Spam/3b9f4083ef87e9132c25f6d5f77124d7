Good Day, 
 

I am Colin Wong, an attorney at law. A deceased client of mine, who
hereinafter shall be referred to as my client, died as the result of a
heart-related condition on the 11 November 2001. His heart condition was
due to the death of all the members of his family in the Gulf Air Flight
Crashes in Persian Gulf Near Bahrain Aired August 23, 2000 - 2:50 p.m. ET
as reported on:http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0008/23/bn.08.html 
 

I have contacted you to assist in distributing the money left behind by my
client before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where
this deposit valued at EIGHTEEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES
DOLLARS. ($18,200.000.00 USD).Is lodged. This bank has issued me a notice
to contact the next of kin, or the account will be confiscated. 
 

My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as the
next-of-kin, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. Then
we can share the amount on a mutually agreed-upon percentage. 
 

All legal documents to back up your claim as my client's next-of-kin will
be provided. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this
transaction through. 
 

This will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you
from many breach of the law. If this business proposition offends your
moral values, do accept my apology. 


I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extraordinary confidential, whatever your
decision, while I await your prompt response. Please contact me at once to
indicate your interest.
