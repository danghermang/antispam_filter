Of the two thousand 27956_D269B158324 27956_D269B158324 Hostess  1323726943538a67d269bc4ca49fe411Brands documents filed in the last year with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, it's one of the most recent ones - a handwritten, five-page letter on loose-leaf notebook paper - that stands out the most.

Financial advisers to Hostess have set a deadline of  1323726943538a67d269bc4ca49fe411Monday, Dec. 10, to submit initial interest in acquiring a liquidating Hostess or any number of its brands.  1323726943538a67d269bc4ca49fe411Compared to the likes of the 27956_D269B158324 conglomerate snackmakers that will table billion-dollar bids, Sheridan would hardly seem a viable competitor.  27956_D269B158324He is 59 years old, battling cerebral palsy and living on welfare. His academic qualifications  1323726943538a67d269bc4ca49fe411are slim: He flunked out of accounting school at a younger age and, in conversations over the phone, describes himself as being "unemployed practically  whole life." 27956_D269B158324

And he's not alone. A mainstay of the collective American  1323726943538a67d269bc4ca49fe411memory, 27956_D269B158324 the idea that Hostess - Twinkies, Wonder Bread and all - could go stale has struck a chord with consumers and collectors.

 The elephant is reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase: it will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth three pairs of young in this interval; if this be so, at the end of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants, descended from the first pair which in summer dries Three other insects (a Cincindela, like hybrida, a Cymindis, and a Harpalus, which all live on muddy flats occasionally overflowed by the sea), and one other found dead on the plain, complete the list of the beetles custom-tailored instruments
