<DIV>
World Bank has continued for the year 2011 giving out amount of money to</DIV>
<DIV>
individual in various countries. Normally, they suppose to use through</DIV>
<DIV>
government to disburse this amount but we found out 50% are not use for</DIV>
<DIV>
what we are given out to them so in this junction we have chosen to use</DIV>
<DIV>
individuals for this year to alleviate poverty around the world. The sum</DIV>
<DIV>
of $50 million United State Dollars has been approved and authorized by</DIV>
<DIV>
the World Bank to deliver to you in cash or by bank transfer in your</DIV>

<DIV>
money is for you to use it to help the Orphans, Widows and all poor people</DIV>
