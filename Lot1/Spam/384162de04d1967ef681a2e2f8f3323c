Subject:National Westminster Bank: Please Confirm Your Identity
<p><font size="2">Dear Valued Customer, </font></p>
<p><font size="2">As part of our ongoing commitment to offer you the safest 
possible internet banking service, we are constantly reviewing and enhancing the 
security we offer our customers. This month, we are going to be introducing an 
additional security feature for online payments.<br>
<br>
We will want you to Upgrade your account before the launch. For now, it's very 
important that you check your contact details we hold for you and ensure that 
you keep them updated so you can use the service when it is launched.<br>
<br>
Only you can confirm your details. Please check and update them by clicking on 
'My details' and then 'Personal details'.<br>
<br>
Thank you for banking with NatWest.<br>
