Subject:For a lonely man
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very beautiful and responsive. 
I like animals and I always try to help every living being.. It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be ambitious, educated and with good sense of humor. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://sakosiwa.thport.com If you want to know me better
