Subject:Affiliate Friendly Traffic... Tons Of It.
Hey,

If you've been trying to drive some more traffic to your 
affiliate offers... you already know this, but... 

Most traffic sources -HATE- affiliate marketing!

Google won't give it to you, and now they won't even let
you pay for it either... 

Facebook won't allow it no matter what. 

And, YouTube has been cancelling accounts without giving
their users any kind of warning... 

What does that mean when you put it all together?

Well, search traffic is nearly impossible to get, social 
media traffic is getting harder by the day, and now it's
looking like video traffic is next on the list...

Those are three of the biggest sources of traffic on the
entire Internet, and as an affiliate marketer ... you're
not allowed to use any of them. 

That's why the big affiliates do this instead:

Although the big three hate affiliates, there's still an
insane amount of affiliate friendly traffic out there...

The key is knowing how, and where to get it...

This is a good place to start.

Thanks & Good Luck,
