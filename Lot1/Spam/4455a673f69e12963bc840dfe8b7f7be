Subject:The right to love
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very kind and responsive. 

I am keen on sports. Sports play a very significant role in my life, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, communicative and with good sense of humor. 

I want to love and to be loved http://zafozozi.daveshostingservice.com Let's start our acquaintance
