Subject:New acquaintances
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very kind and romantic. 

I like to travel there. I would like to try some extreme sports. I am very adventure woman.. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, educated and with various interests. 
I want to love and to be loved http://kipiruqi.bestnoise.com Let's start our acquaintance
