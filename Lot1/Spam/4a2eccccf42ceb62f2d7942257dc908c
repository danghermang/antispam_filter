Subject:One important thing
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and generous. 

I like animals and I always try to help every living being.. 
It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be serious, communicative and with various interests. 

I want to love and to be loved http://xovasupo.crystal-hosting.org Let's begin our acquaintance
