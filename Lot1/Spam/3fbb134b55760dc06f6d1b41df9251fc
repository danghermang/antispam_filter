Subject:30 minutes of work = $300 per month.
Hey,

If you have 30 minutes of free time, and can follow some
very simple instructions... you can start cranking out a
few hands-free, automatic money makers of your own...

The kind of websites that bring in recurring money, each
and every month, whether you touch them again or not...

Each website is just one page, and they don't need to be 
updated .. you just set them up one time, and then watch
the free traffic start coming to you. 

And, because of the kind of traffic these sites get, you
can get $100, $300, or even $500 a month out of each web
site you create...

Now I'm not sure about you... but I think I could find a
30 minutes of time for that kind of money. Am I right?

And don't forget, that money comes in every month... 

30 minutes one time, could mean hundreds of dollars that
comes in time, after time... year after year.

One page, one time, and you've could have real recurring
income coming in for years... this is how it's done:
