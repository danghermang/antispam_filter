BENIN REP.PAY-OUT CENTER
 
Attention Beneficiary,
 
We wish to inform you that the United Nations (UN) has taken over the Inheritance/Prize Winning payment issue which you currently or previously had with your transaction agents. Your funds was withdrawn by UN on your behalf based on the fact that you were subjected to too many processes that will make you spend more money before receiving your funds.
Your Inheritance/Winning payment was paid out to the United Nations Organization, and they have succeeded in depositing your funds with us. They have ordered Western Union to take full responsibility in the transfer process of your funds, and we have received your application for the first installment of $7,600 USD from the total amount of $1,950,000.00 USD, One Million NINE Hundred AND FIFTY Thousand United States Dollars.
For some security reasons, we need you to reconfirm your Name, Address, Age and Phone Number before receiving the MTCN for the first installment, and we will email you others after 24 hours of receiving each payment.
