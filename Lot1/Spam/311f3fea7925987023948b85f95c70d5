Subject:Urgent please.
Dear Friend,

There is information I think might interest you. First of all, I do not know if I am talking to the right person, But I will like you to confirm if you are the owner of this email ID. Already I have your name and some details in my file in the office, but I want to be sure if i am communicating with the right owner of this email.

If you can prove that you are the owner of this email ID, I will like you to furnish me with your remaining information to enable me cross-check it with the one I have so that i can be convince that i am talking to the right person. I am taking this preventive measure because I do not want to talk to the wrong person due to the sensitivity of the information involved. Other details will be forwarded to you as soon as I am convinced that I am communicating with the right person.

Yours truly.

Dr Smart Duru.
