I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very kind and generous. 
I enjoy long walks in a forest, sea-shore or just a park.... 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, reliable and with various interests. 

I want to love and to be loved http://rumogex.eg.vg Let's start our acquaintance
