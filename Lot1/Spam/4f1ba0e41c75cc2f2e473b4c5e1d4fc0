Subject:Enquiry
Hello,


We have a client who died intestate and therefore no one was nominated as a next of kin.



It is our bank policy that all  the investment under our bank be given to the rightfully people, this is where my department of initial services comes in play, our job is try and find any anybody who might be related to the deceased and our sole purposes is to ensure that  relatives of the decease inherit the funds.



 Your name has been linked as possible relative to our deceased client, we have to legally investigate all information that we come across. We need to be certain that you are the right person that we need to communicate to in this regards.



The following information will assist in verifying whether we have the correct information:-
• Are you aware of any relative/relation having the same surname, which’s last known, contact address was Amsterdam, Netherlands? 

• Are you aware of any investment of considerable value made by such a person at the HSBC Bank Plc.?

• Can you establish beyond reasonable doubt your eligibility to assume status of next of kin to the deceased?



It is relevant that you inform us ASAP whether or not you are familiar with this personality that we may put an end to this communication with you and our inquiries surrounding this personality.
 
We thank you in advance for your urgent assistance in this regard.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Tim Brownfield
