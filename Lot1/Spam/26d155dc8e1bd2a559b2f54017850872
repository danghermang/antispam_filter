	<p>Creating a great business plan and having a successful pitch meeting wi=
th angel investors is not always enough to secure funding for your new busi=
ness. You also need to know how to negotiate effectively to move past the i=
nitial stages of the investment process. In some sense, negotiation is one =
of the most difficult aspects of getting funding because it requires compro=
mise from both sides of the table. New entrepreneurs have specific goals in=
 mind, so it can be upsetting when investors aren=E2=80=99t willing to shar=
e them. You might need to make some changes to your plan and goals to convi=
nce investors to commit to your project, but at the same time you should ne=
ver undersell yourself or your ideas.</p>

<p>Practice is the key to learning how to negotiate, but there are some bas=
ics you should keep in mind to improve your negotiating skills faster. Don=
=E2=80=99t negotiate over the phone. It=E2=80=99s tempting to try and move =
things along, but face-to-face negotiations are always your best bet. If yo=
u feel pressured to commit to a specific deal on the phone, politely ask to=
 meet in person. In fact, you should never give in to pressure whether you =
are on the phone or at a face-to-face meeting. New entrepreneurs are someti=
mes afraid that if they don=E2=80=99t commit to a deal right then and there=
 the investor will pull out of the negotiations. </p>
<p>However, making important decisions on the spot is simply a bad strategy=
. Always ask for some time to think about a proposition before agreeing to =
it. As long as you make it clear that you are open to new ideas and suggest=
ions, investors should give you some breathing room to make decisions that =
can have a big effect on your business.</p>
<p>Don=E2=80=99t be afraid to start high and lower your expectations as the=
 negotiations continue. Just make sure that you are starting with a realist=
ic number and make it clear that you are open to concessions if they come w=
ith the right terms. Set goals before negotiations start, so you have a fra=
mework for what you are willing and not willing to agree to. For example, y=
ou should have an idea of what percentage of your company you would be will=
ing to give away to investors. Coming in without a strategy makes it that m=
uch harder to get what you want because you can quickly lose sight of your =
needs and long-term objectives.</p>
<p>Listen to what investors have to say before you interrupt or shut down t=
heir ideas.</p>

<p>Angel investors like to work with entrepreneurs who are willing to make =
changes to their business model, so it=E2=80=99s important to set your ego =
aside during the negotiation process. Since it=E2=80=99s your business, lis=
tening to someone=E2=80=99s ideas of how it should be run can be frustratin=
g, but don=E2=80=99t let it upset you. Part of negotiations is listening to=
 offers and countering them with yours until you reach a compromise, so it=
=E2=80=99s normal to hear a few proposals that might sound unfair. Staying =
calm and collected will get you further than getting angry or frustrated.</=
