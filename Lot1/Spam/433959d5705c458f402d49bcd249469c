Subject:I want to say
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very pretty and responsive. I am keen on sports. Sports play a very significant role in my life, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be ambitious, communicative and with various interests. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://vzcfjmqt.5ballov.ru Let's begin our acquaintance
