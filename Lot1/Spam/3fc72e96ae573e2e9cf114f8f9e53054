Subject:Access the websites
Hi,

I'm  Spc. Crisma Albarran,a member of the U.S. ARMY Task Force 38's B Company, 3rd Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment, Iraq. I would like to share some highly personal classified information about my personal experience; I know you would be surprise to read this from a total stranger like me. However I would hold back hold certain information for security reasons till you visit the websites below in order for you to have an insight into what I intend sharing with you for our benefits

Confirm if you have access the websites so that I can be more vivid in my next mail to you due to the fact that I am suppose to be in states with the last batch of troops that just left Iraq for the final evacuation but I was redeployed to Iraq under the Task Force 38's B Company that will end by October 2011.

Thanks,

Spc. Crisma Albarran.
