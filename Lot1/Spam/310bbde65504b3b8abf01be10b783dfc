Subject:Will you let ME do the work for YOU?
Hey,

So, late last year I shared my business model with
a small group of people... I let them all know just
how I've been able to work at home, for myself, and
do it without any employees, or outsourced staff.

I've been working at home, in an office just off my
kitchen, for almost 13 years now... and I'd like to
give you the opportunity to do the same.

And I want to give you access to the same tools and
software that I had developed for me ... this isn't
a scaled down version either - it's the real deal.

Now I do have to let you know in advance... I don't
run my business like anyone else. I've designed the
whole thing around two things that I consider to be
non-negotiable requirements...

 1. I need to be able to do it from home, without
    any employees, and without any office space.
   
 2. It needs to make me money, every day, whether
    or not I turn on my computer.
     
It's taken me almost 13 years to figure it all out
and put all the pieces together... and I've made a
few mistakes along the way, but now it just works.

Everything you're about to see came from me... 

It's very personal, and what you're about to learn
isn't for everyone ... it's not meant to be.

Some people want an office. Some people want a big
staff. Some people love outsourcing... 

I'm not one of those people. 

I need to be able to take time off whenever I want
to, I need to be able to make money even when I am
not at the computer, and I can't stand the thought 
of having any overhead... 

If you'd like to learn how I do it... here's how:

Thanks & Good Luck,
