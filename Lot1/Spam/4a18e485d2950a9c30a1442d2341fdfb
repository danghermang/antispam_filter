Subject:Here's my letter
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very pretty and responsive. 

I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. 
It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, communicative and with various interests. 
I want to love and to be loved http://sakosiwa.thport.com If you want to know me better
