I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very kind and generous. 
I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. 
It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, educated and very attentive. I want to love and to be loved http://colaremo.yaraho.com Let's begin our acquaintance
