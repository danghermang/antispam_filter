Subject:Where to find you?
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very nice and responsive. I always try to keep myself in a good shape.. 
It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, educated and with good sense of humor. I want to love and to be loved http://xadopalu.worthlessorwonderful.com Let's start our acquaintance
