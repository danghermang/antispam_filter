Hello,my name is crystal im 27 years old.i was hoping maybe you can give me some answers,or some advice.i was shot in my femur by .50 cali black powder gun in april 2009.it shattered a big piece of my femur bone.basically turned it into dust.also my femur is broke in 3 places,and then while the doctor was trying to place the screw at my knee he fractured my knee,and was unable to put the screw in.so i only have one screw holding the rod running from my hip to my knee.he says that he will never take the rod out or the screw is this true?after a month of complaining about my knee thats when he told me that it was fractured when i was shot,but my medical records,and xrays before,and after surgery dont lie.i didnt know anything about the fracture until he told me.he sent me for an xray in july 2009 the radiologist reports theres no sighns of healing.is this normal?just recently i am able to lift my own leg.my knee doesnt bend all the way.i still cant walk at all,and its going on 
 5 months.when should i be able to walk again?the doctor told me no physical therapy until i mend,but he forgot that he had sighned me up for them to come to my home three days a week.i told him,and he tells me to quit.i told physical therapy this they quit saying the dr didnt know what he was doing,and the dr hadnt told them about all of my injuries.i have tried to get a second oppinion,and cant due to malpractice thats what they all tell me.even though i have not tried suing him or anything like that.now i just went in for another xray there is a big piece of bone falling off of the rod,and its really close to my artery.that artery has already almost killed me once.so im really scared.he keeps telling me im ok.the radiologist says im not.my family doctor says im not.is one screw enough to hold the rod in place,because i can feel something rolling in my leg?i cant put no weight on that leg or my knee bows,and my leg gives.what can i do?please,please help if you can.i know yo
 ur not an orthopedic,but i dont know who else to ask.im all out of places to go,and people to go to.On March 17, 1995 I broke both of my femurs in a car accident. Right one was a clean break and the left was crushed. The bad part about it I was 3 months pregnant with my daughter thats a 14 year old healthy girl today. I went into surgery the same day that it happened. Stayed in the hospital for 2 weeks and was moved to another hospital for rehabilation, that I stayed at for 1 month. Today, I don't really have problems with my legs. Every now and then they seem to get really stiff, and I can tell when its about to rain or get cold. I do have a ?, Do you know what happens when you do not take the rods out of your legs?Hi, i broke my femur August 28th, 2009 in the 4th quarter of my football game. I made a bad kick on the kick-off, but it would have been good if i had ment to do an onside kick. I am not the safety after i kick i just go and try tomake the take and on this pertic
 ular play i was about 4ft from the ball and i jucked to go back the right way and right when i did i just fell. When I hit the ground i herd a crunch, i though ough i sprained it bad and tried to get up. Then i realized i couldn't get up, about ten seconds later the pain kicked in. Well i got a titanium rod put in my femur and 4 screws 2 at my knee and 2 at my hip. My knee hurts the worst but seems to be getting better, i cant bend my knee at all though or i am in horindus pain. Also i can't feel my groin area the doctors said it was from the positioning of my body during the procedure, that my groin was place on a big pole or board of some sort. Can somebody help me out and tell me if this sounds ok, i'd really appreciate it.


Thanks, BmanI broke my left femur, my right and left pelvis, my lower leg, and wrist in an automobile accident on Thanksgiving 2008. I had 5 surgeries before Christmas and was kept unconscious in intensive care until after Christmas. I spent two months in the regular hospital, part of it waiting for my leg to be ready to do a skin graft (the car ate part of my lower left leg). My therapy there was basically getting in and out of a wheelchair using a slide board. I was transferred to a rehab hospital where I spent a month trying to learn how to hop (my left leg was completely non weight bearing for most of the month) then to walk with a walker. It is slowly coming up on a year and I am still dealing with the injury. I have foot drop that is going to require surgery number 7 (6 was the skin graft) and now I have a mass on my inner thigh that my reg dr did a sonogram and mri on and now tells me that I have to go back to my orthopedic surgeon to see if the mass needs to be draine
 d. When I have been sitting or laying down for a long period of time I have a lot of pain and stiffness when I get up. This might sound like whining but I am fortunate to be alive and walking around with a walker!!!
