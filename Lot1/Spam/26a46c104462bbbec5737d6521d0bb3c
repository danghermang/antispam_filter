Subject:Last Chance. (PayPal Called Me Recently!)
Hey,

Over the past few days I've been telling you about 
the ex-PayPal insider... a guy who used to work at
PayPal freezing, limiting, and closing accounts. 

He saw who was making money, when it was coming in
and more importantly... where it was coming from.

Now look, I don't know if the call has anything to
do with my emails... but, I did get a call from my
PayPal representative...

Needless to say, this will be my last email to you
about Steven, and what he learned while working on
one of the most controversial teams at PayPal.

Even if the call from my PayPal rep has nothing to
do with my last couple of emails... it's too big a
coincidence for me to ignore. 

So for the last time, if you want to know what the
ex-insider learned, and what may have prompted the
call from my personal PayPal representative...

Thanks & Good Luck,
Gary Ambrose

P.S. I hope you understand why I won't be sending 
another email about this... like I said, I really 
don't know if this is why they called me, but I'm
not willing to risk my account to find out...
