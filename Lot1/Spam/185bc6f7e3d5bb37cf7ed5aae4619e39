Subject:What do you say?
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and generous. 

I fond of outdoor sports special cycling and skiing.. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, reliable and very attentive. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://kexufap.elwagba.com Let's start our acquaintance
