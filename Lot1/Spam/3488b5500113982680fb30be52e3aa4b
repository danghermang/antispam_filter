Subject:Underlying it all
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and responsive. 

I fond of outdoor sports special cycling and skiing.. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, reliable and with good sense of humor. 
I want to love and to be loved http://cadoyeki.lhosting.info Let's begin our acquaintance
