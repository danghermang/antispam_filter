Subject:It is just great
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very nice and responsive. 

I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be ambitious, educated and with various interests. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://zcgjnqux.5ballov.ru Let's start our acquaintance
