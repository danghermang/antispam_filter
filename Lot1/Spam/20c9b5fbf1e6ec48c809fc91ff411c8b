<p style=3D"margin:0 0 10px 0;font-family:georgia;font-size:21px;">From the=
 Desk of Roger S. Conrad</p>
<hr style=3D"margin:0 0 35px 0;" size=3D"1" noshade=3D"noshade" />
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">Fellow Investor,</p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">If you own any of the 6 stocks I'm about t=
o name, I urge you to take immediate action.&nbsp; </p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">All of these companies have just failed my=
 key safety rating barometer&hellip; and history tells me that when that ha=
ppens, the bottom could drop out of the share price at any moment.</p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">On the surface, these industry giants look=
 like solid, well-run companies, especially for safety-conscious investors =
looking for high income yields and safe, steady gains.</p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">But the truth is their high-dividend yield=
s are nothing but smoke and mirrors.&nbsp; Simply put, the dividends these =
companies are paying are too high &mdash; and unsustainable.&nbsp; At these=
 levels, there is no cash left for corporate growth or capital reinvestment=
.&nbsp; </p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">And that is a big red flag for investors.&=
nbsp; That's why I've just added these 6 stocks to my urgent &quot;Investor=
's Blacklist.&quot; If you own any of these companies, I urge you to SELL y=
our stock immediately.&nbsp; It won't be long before the rest of the market=
 figures out what my proprietary system has already uncovered&hellip; and w=
hen they do you can be certain these stocks will take a nasty tumble.</p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">Please don't be the one left holding the b=
ag when that happens.</p>

<br />
from the Huge Losses Ahead </p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">My name is Roger Conrad. In the industry, =
I'm known as &quot;The Tortoise King.&quot; I think it's a compliment. It w=
as bestowed upon me because of the safe and steady way I win the investing =
race. <strong>Since 1990, my picks have racked up safe, steady gains of 13.=
3% annually.</strong></p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">Now I'd like to give you the names of all =
6 companies on my updated &quot;blacklist&quot; absolutely FREE. It's just =
one of the things you'll get in my new Special Report, <strong><em>The Inco=

<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">In addition to my new, updated &quot;black=

 5 high-dividend stock picks for the coming months (more on those in a mome=
nt), as well as page after page of simple strategies you can use to cut you=
r risk and put yourself on the road to greater wealth right away. </p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">One thing I've learned over my long invest=
ing career is that the key to securing your financial future &mdash; and be=
ating the measly returns you'll get on 10-Year Treasury Bonds (barely 1.5%)=
 or a 1-Year CD (a pathetic 1%) &mdash; is to hold a carefully chosen selec=
tion of high-dividend stocks.</p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">But you want to hold the right dividend pa=
yers &mdash; strong, secure companies that prosper in good times and hold t=
heir own in market setbacks. You want to zero in on companies with strong c=
ash flows to back up their rising payouts.</p>
<p style=3D"margin-bottom:14px;">That's what I help you do FREE in this new=
 Special Report. You'll learn all about:<br />

<ul>
<li><strong>How to measure a stock's staying power: </strong>I'll take you =
inside my simple <strong>8-point system</strong>, which I've designed to se=
parate the wheat from the chaff: when you match up a stock against these 8 =
crucial factors, you'll be able to see at a glance whether it's a long-term=
 wealth builder &mdash; or if you should drop it like a hot potato.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>How to avoid the 3 deadly investor mistakes:</strong> Focusing =
solely on high yields is just one fatal mistake that most income investors =
make. In this report, I show you 3 others that can rob you of your hard-ear=
ned cash, and give you simple tips on how to steer clear.<br />

 utilities. It's also profiting from low gas prices and is set to tap into =
its huge potential to grow beyond its current operations in Canada, the U.S=

<li><strong>Dial up steady income and big gains with this major telecom ope=
rator. </strong>This behemoth is using its huge cash pile to do two things:=
 reward its investors with steadily rising dividends and bring in lightning=
-fast Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology. That's making its exploding num=
ber of smartphone-wielding customers very happy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>This natural gas distribution utility has plenty of room to gro=
w. </strong>Future spending plans are modest, plus regulations in the compa=
ny's operating region have factored out volatile natural gas prices.  Best =
of all, new long-term contracts with midstream gas assets will fire up grow=
th for this sure-fire winner... without sacrificing one iota of reliability=
.</li>
