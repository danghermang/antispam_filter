I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very beautiful and generous. 
I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be positive, reliable and with various interests. 
I want to love and to be loved http://qojobiwu.90op.com Let's start our acquaintance
