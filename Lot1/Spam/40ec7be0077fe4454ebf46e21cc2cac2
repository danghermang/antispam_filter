Subject:PayPal's latest dirty trick...  
Hey,

A former PayPal insider is finally opening up about
his time working in the "asset protection" team for 
PayPal... 

What that really means is... he wrote the code that 
froze, limited, and closed PayPal accounts.. he was
protecting PayPal's assets, not yours. :(

Anyway, Steven's non-disclosure expired, and he has
been talking up a storm... and, I can't imagine the
people at PayPal being very happy about it. 

For example, he got insider information about which
PayPal accounts were bringing in tons of money, and
of course... that gave him an unfair advantage. 

He talks about everything here...

That's not the kind of stuff that excites me... but
when you put together a world class programmer with
insider information on where money is being made in
real time... 

That excites me.

Steven's job at PayPal was to figure out how all of
these guys were making their money... was it on the
up and up? Or, was it something shady?

PayPal paid him figure it out... 

Now... how would you like to know what he learned?

Thanks & Good Luck,
Gary Ambrose
