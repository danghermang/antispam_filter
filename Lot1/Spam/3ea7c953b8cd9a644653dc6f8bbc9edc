<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why Hospitals Continually Lose Money When Purchasing Healthcare TVs </span></b></p>
<p>Healthcare TVs cost as much as 4 times the price of a consumer TV.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the Healthcare Television industry has convinced hospitals they must pay the extra charge so that a simple device that allows a TV to communicate with a pillow speaker can be added.</p>
<p>There is another, more cost-effective solution.</p>
<p>The Paradigm HC20 Interface Technology allows a normal consumer level LCD and LED television to be transformed into a Healthcare TV.</p>
<p>Now Hospitals can by any size or brand TV at the same cost as the consumer and add all the benefits of a healthcare TV afterwards.</p>
<p>This technology has been verified and tested to be <b>100% compliant with UL healthcare</b> <b>standards</b>, and has already been installed in dozens of hospitals and long term care facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
