Dear Beneficiary,

PAYMENT NOTIFICATION OF YOUR FUNDS.smithatm@sify.com 10/12/2012

Definitely, I am sure that the receipt of this
email will be of utmost blessing to you.I am
Mr.Whale Smith the personal secretary to Mr
Lamido Sanusi, The Executive Governor of The
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)you are being
officially contacted by me today because I was
instructed to do so by my boss The Executive
Governor of The Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN),kindly note that your Funds were Re-
deposited into the"Federal Suspense Account" of the CBN
last week,because you did not forward your Claim
as the Right beneficiary.

The Central Bank of Nigeria is the parent Bank of
all commercial Banks here in Nigeria.My boss The
Executive Governor of The Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN),was visited in his office by three
gentlemen last week, really these men were
unexpected by him because their visit was
impromptu. He had to ask them why they came to
see him in person and they said that they came to
collect the Inheritance/ contract funds Bill Sum
of (US $10,000,000:00)$10 million which
rightfully belongs to you, At this development He
asked them who authorized them to come down to
Nigeria for the Collection of this Payment and
they told him that you asked them to come and
collect these Funds on your Behalf.
In fact this was the biggest shock that this Bank
has ever received so far because your Inheritance
Funds is still in the "Federal Suspense Account"
of CBN,yet you sent these men to come and collect
this Funds on your behalf without notifying us.
We do not understand why you should
send these men to come and Collect your Funds on
your behalf. If actually you want them to help you collect
your funds, you should have at least informed him
officially as the Executive Governor of this
Bank.Note that they actually tendered some Vital
Documents which proved that you actually sent
them for the Collection of these Funds.
Honestly, it really shocked him that you took
such a decision without his consent.Below is list
of the Documents which they tendered to this Bank
today.

1. LETTER OF ADMINISTRATION.
2. HIGH COURT INJUNCTION.
3. ORDER TO RELEASE.

Actually, these Documents which they tendered to
this Noble Bank are a clear Proof that you sent
them to Collect this Funds for you. Finally,He,
Mr Lamido Sanusi told them to come back tomorrow
morning and they promised to come back.As the
Governor of this Noble Bank, he was supposed to
Release this Funds to them but he refused to do
so because he wanted to clarify this from you
first.

KINDLY DO GET BACK TO ME WITH YOUR TELEPHONE
NUMBER SO I CAN REACH YOU AS FAST AS
POSSIBLE OK.

Due to the Nature of his job, he cannot afford to
make any mistake in releasing these Funds to
anyone except you who is the Recognized Bonafide
Beneficiary to these Funds.

Kindly clarify us on this issue before we make
this Payment to these foreigners whom came on
your behalf.Note that for security reasons you
have been assigned a code/password which is
{TT7270CBN},Please note that this code is the
reference number for your transfer and its being
disclosed to you alone,guard this jealously and
all your email response should carry this code as
the subject.
