Subject:The right to love
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very kind and generous. 
I enjoy simple things. I am very good at cooking and drawing.. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be ambitious, reliable and with various interests. I want to love and to be loved http://korozuz.boatinghost.com If you want to know me better
