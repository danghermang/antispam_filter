Subject:[CT Birds] Siskins aplenty
You gotta love these little Pine Siskins.  They must be from the boonies up
north where they have not had much contact with people.  I was out blowing
leaves today--a really noisy enterprise--and the Siskins remained perched
on the feeders when I was only a few feet away.  There were certainly no
other birds brave enough (or dumb enough) to stay in the back yard around
the blower.  I finally got a good count of over 60 when I had the ability
to view not only the ones at the feeders, but all the ones in the trees
watching and waiting their turns.  What a fun way to go broke.
