Subject:Re: [mat-wg] New on RIPE Labs: New Text Service for RIPEstat
Hello Mirjam, et al,

thank you for the work on providing the text-based output for STAT.
Please send thank-yous to the team.

I have just noticed that if you query for e.g. an IPv4 prefix,
it also seems to report a 1% IPv6-visibility on the 88 IPv6 peers.
Is that a rounding-bug? :)

Cheers
Sascha
