Subject:[h-cost] Brides wearing red
I wouldn't rely on the author's credentials, whether impressive or not, 
but on the information in the book itself, which is what counts.

That said, "brides wore their best dress" is a shorthand comment used 
for many historic periods. It conveys that wedding dresses in periods 
before 1920 or so did not follow a common modern custom of buying an 
expensive dress in a style not wearable for anyone but a bride. As far 
as I know, there is a very long-standing custom of people who could 
afford to do so buying new clothes for weddings, and comparatively 
expensive and fashionable ones for their social station, rather than 
being married in clothes they already had, even "best" clothes. It's 
just that the new clothes were in a style they could wear after the 
wedding.

I also don't know that any one color was in long-standing fashion before 
the Victorian and later custom of wearing white.  Note that before 
overall dry cleaning, white silks were status fabrics because they 
became grubby quickly and were hard to clean, though they could be dyed.
