Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] RFI:   Comparison of Olympus digital recorders
I'd give the DM-550 a try before looking at other models. It might be ok, depending on what quality you want, but I see that it has voice activation and noise cancelling. These are desirable features for dictation, but unless they can be turned off I think they'll mess up your recordings.

Bird calls might not be loud enough to trigger the voice activation, and the noise cancellation might consider them to be background noise that it should filter out.
