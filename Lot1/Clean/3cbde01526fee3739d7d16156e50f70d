Well, I *do* care about the way we use the community's resources in
policy building.  

If everybody gets exhausted doing a new round of IPv4 PI policy every 
time the "we do IPv4 PI only until <x> happens, and then no more!" mark 
is reached, other policy proposals do not get the attention they deserve.

(By which I'd ask you to please stay away from a PI policy that will
do things like "but only in the first /9 of the last /8, not in the
second /9" - *iff* the community decides to bring back IPv4 PI, then
let's do it for good and for all the remaining space.  Doing it for
"but not for the last /x" is exactly what we have now - let's not do
*that* again).
