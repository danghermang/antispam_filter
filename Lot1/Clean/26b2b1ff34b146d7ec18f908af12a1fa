With the additional costs per year, does ARIN intend on providing more services in addition to IP allocation assistance? Or will ARIN continue with the status-quo? In other words, how will ARIN really add *benefit* to the SMB market by instituting this new fee structure?

Many of these "enhancements" could also be characterized as making the interface
more convenient for ARIN while simultaneously making it more difficult for small
consulting firms to work with their SMB enterprise and ISP clients on ARIN
interactions.

Intent or not, it is the net effect. Even an organization with a small number
of blocks, say 2 IPv4 blocks an IPv6 block and an ASN goes from $100/year
to $400/year, making their fees 4000% larger in a single year.
