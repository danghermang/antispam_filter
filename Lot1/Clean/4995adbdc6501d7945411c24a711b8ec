From Jim and Carol Zipp
11/4 - Hamden yard.  Carol and I were watching the 3 newly arrived FOX SPARROWS 
when 9 EVENING GROSBEAKS dropped down onto our feeders.  PURPLE FINCH, PINE 
SISKINS still around but not in as great numbers as previously. Purples have 
been present since the beginning of September.

I did grab a min of video through the windows here....
