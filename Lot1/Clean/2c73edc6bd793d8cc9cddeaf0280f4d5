Well, the "balance adjustment", or any other "adjustment",=A0 is not going =

 "off" ?=A0 The tone arm wire is stiff, or catching on something ?=A0 How a=
bout the needles--have you swapped them ? Ron Rich=20

Haven't adjusted anything, and haven't played juke for a few weeks. It will
not track the "A" side because either the tone arm balance is screwed up or
something is binding, but what I don't get is it plays the "B" side fine.=

Jeff,
Don't understand what you are saying here "--tone arm balanced-----ok".
Did you "reset" the balance--how--why, if so ?

It had not been rejecting and I figured that was the little magnet that fel=

off since I could eject manually and have been putting off this repair.
Played it today and the "A" side won't track, tone arm is balanced to keep
it from floating freely till about half-way through record then it tracks
ok, it doesn't seem to be a lube issue and it plays "B" side normally. Neve=

had this problem before, any ideas on where to start.=20
