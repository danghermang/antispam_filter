Subject:[Birding-Aus] The birds and the bees - nectar feeders
Hi all,

I've just heard an interesting report on ABC Radio Australia about the fact that commercial beekeepers, in terms of nectar production, are having one of their worst seasons on record. The report suggests, that due to our wet winter and cool spring, trees and shrubs are putting all their energy in the development of green growth rather than flowering. See

Anecdotally, I also think the lack of flowering has had an impact the number of nectar feeding birds i.e. our honeyeaters and lorikeets. Personally I've noticed far less lorikeets about the place. For instance, just this morning on my ride to work (through Royal Park in Melbourne) there were virtually no lorikeets. Interestingly the main type of lorikeet I did see (hear) was Little Lorikeet.

The report concludes that our plants are still growing but it will take 12 months to see the benefits, and that this time next year we'll be having a good honey season. I'm speculating that the same applies to our nectar feeding birds, certainly across southern and eastern Australia. In theory spring 2013 will be the 'year' of the nectar feeders!

Cheers,

Tim
