Subject:Re: [kurtlist] US Stars on Ice tour schedule announced

Huh. So that's why they wanted to keep the same cast for Japan and US?
I thought they wanted to use Japan Tour as extra rehearsal, like
pre-broadway shows in Chicago or in SF, but it does not sound like the
case with two shows in US without TV recording before Japan Tour.

I was hoping with the cast they'd do Waiting For My Real Life Begins
in Japan, but with the news, probably not.

I am not sure if they use the same recording for Japan and US because
I think sponsor logos must be different. I'd bet it will be in Osaka
because the ice rink in Tokyo will be very, very small as the venue is
made for tennis, only 42 meter long (46 yard) and I was told they will
arrange multiple arena seats on the tiny surface.

One number per skater, yes. Filming multiple shows, no for recent
years of JSOI. Unless some guest skaters perform only in Osaka or in
Tokyo.

The biggest difference is that they do not do retakes in Japan. Once,
a few years ago, they inserted another night's recording for the part
Mao fell on a jump, then some people made a great big fuss about it
and it got to the point the president of the TV station had to make a
comment on the "problem." It was very stupid, especially when singers
on TV almost always do lip-sync on "live" show. Anyway, that was the
only attempt of some sort of retakes.

So, I am very curious about if they'd do retakes for US broadcast recording.

Also I am a bit worried about camera switchings. US and Canadians
usually do great job on choosing camera. But in Japan they just switch
them live and it is always like 1-2 seconds too late so it keeps
showing back of the head and miss the essential part.
