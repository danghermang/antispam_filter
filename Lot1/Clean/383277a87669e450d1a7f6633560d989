Subject:Re: [EVDL] EVLN: EVs powering homes when the power is knocked out
Several of us in EVADC fixed our Leafs for emergency power during Sandy.
All it takes is a standard inverter connected to the 12 volt supply. Turn
on the Leaf so the DC/DC is active and you have power. I figure I can run
the refrigerator, sump pump, and small television for several days from my
Leaf. Any EV should be able to do this and a plug in hybrid will start the
engine when the pack gets low, providing even more power.
