Also I have recently discovered that the Virginmedia so-called Superhub 
(more like Stuporhub) latest firmware update forced on customers is 
broken.  In essence it won't let you carry out some basic functions 
unless the Firewall security is set to Low, and it doesn't even tell you 
anywhere the difference between Low, Medium and High.  For example, to 
FTP I have to set the Firewall to Low, upload or download my files, and 
then reset the Firewall to Medium.  You may think an easy remedy would 
be to set a Port Forwarding rule on port 21 to my desktop PC.  
Unfortunately the forums are full of people complaining that Port 
Forwarding on the Superhub doesn't work, and in my experience they're right.

Sorry for the segue, but my point is not to rely solely on your router's 
firewall, especially if provided by your ISP as you have no control over 
updates.
