Subject:Re: [EVDL] Level 2 charging in MT
Here in Tucson, when any of the Dealers installed EVSE's, I went to each of
them and told them that we had about 10 conversions and asked if it would be
alright if in an emergency, we could use their chargers. They all said no
problem and that if the space wasn't free  (since they usually parked gas
engine cars in them), just to let the manager know and he make the space
available. I also found that besides the EVSE out front, that the service
area had one that they used, so dealers usually have at least 2 EVSE's.
