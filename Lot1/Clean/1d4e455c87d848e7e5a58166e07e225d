Subject:[CT Birds] parking to walk into Lighthouse Park
This worked for me early in the season when the gate wasn't opened one morning:

As you approach the park on Lighthouse Road, take a left on Morris Ave; go a block past Dolby Place and you should be out of the no parking zone; then walk back the way you came in, take a left on Dolby, right on Marin Road and you're back close to the entrance. It's not that far.
