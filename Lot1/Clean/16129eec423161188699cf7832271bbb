Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Well .......
I fear that we have arrived at the loop point in a footballing equivalent of groundhog day. We are now back to 'we'll score more goals than you'. In fact, with our current clown defence, we have no choice. We're just fortunate that we're able to. 
Wonder what Swansea will bring.
