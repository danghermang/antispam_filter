Dear Bob, Mike and all,
The Las Vegas story may have 'some legs' (as they say).
The late Jos Willems indicates in his definitive Louis' discography that "Hello Dolly" and "A Lot Of Livin' To Do" were recorded in New York for Kapp (the label) on 3 December 1963 and released as a single (K573). 
Ten additional titles were recorded on 7-11 April 1964 to complete the HELLO DOLLY LP album.
He further notes that: "Universal holds two major reels that carry multitrack versions of the Hello Dolly LP. The All Stars and Louis contribution to both is identical. The difference is only in the background of the banjo/guitar and strings/winds which were overdubbed separately at later sessions." 
These ten later titles were recorded in Las Vegas!
So Bob's version of the story may still be correct.
Is the banjo/guitar present on the original Kapp single of "Hello Dolly/There's A Lot Of Livin' To Do "?
However.
Mr Willems does provide the banjoist's name, Tony Gottuso, for the 3 December 1963 session.
Which suggests that he was there on the day. Even though the banjo/guitar part may have been overdubbed.
For the 7-11 April 1964 Las Vega sessions the banjo/guitar work is credited to Glen Thompson.
Who said the study of discography was boring?
Very kind regards,
Bill (who, at the moment, is playing the original Hello Dolly LP album (KS -3364).
PS: For the trivia-minded. 
The December 1963 recording session and the Puerto Rico trip were Trummy Young's last with Louis' All Stars.
