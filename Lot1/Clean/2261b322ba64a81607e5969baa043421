They could use a web based approach, such as:

http://www.learnpython.org

And something like web2py framework for meatier exercises.

Thus only have to install the tools on a web server. I dare say there
are still security issues, but these days with cloud based virtual
servers the worse case is you roll back the server to a previous snapshot.

The learnpython.org content in under CC license, so I assume they are
happy to share it, and happy to receive improved tutorials.
