Subject:Re: [EVDL] Best EV Tires
Hi folks,
The Scott Drive has adjustable regen.  You can turn the regen off for good
coasting and wire it to the brake switch.  A light touch on the brake pedal
will activate regen but not the hydraulic brakes.  One user (RAV4 direct
drive) has regen activated all the time because he lives in very steep
hilly country.  He has a button to de-activate the regen for when there is
ice on the road.

As for the coast vs regen debate, it completely depends whether you are a
NY taxi driver (regen good) or live in rural Kansas (coasting good).  Steep
hills are better with regen, but flat or mellow hills is better with
coasting.  The best system is coasting with variable regen applied by a
potentiometer on the first part of the brake pedal stroke.  This is best on
an AWD car, second-best on a FWD car, and least effective on RWD since the
rear tires will skid at high regen levels.  The BLDC permanent magnet motor
used in the Scott system can easily skid the wheels if regen is applied in
full.  If you would like more info on this system send me an email.

Tire pressure - more IS better.  I improved ICE mileage 10% by going from
45psi to 65psi (44psi max tires).  At first the ride seems harsh, but after
a while if you lower the pressure you feel like you are driving in wet
sand.  This has been hashed to death on forums such as ecomodder with some
folks scared to even use the max psi (fools) and others going 20psi over
for the life of the tire with no bad results (in fact the tires last almost
TWICE as long).  The police pump their tires WAY over max when doing
closed-course pursuit training.  On the street there is liability so they
run the absolute max on the sidewall.  When hitting a curb at 60mph a tire
with higher pressure is much better and less likely to fail from a "pinch"
flat like you get when riding a 10 speed over a sidewalk crack.

Hunter S. Thompson was on to something when he pumped the Caddy up to
100psi   ~:o

Cheers
