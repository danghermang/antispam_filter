Steve raises an important point that was obscured by Bertrand's poor performance. How do we shore up our left side when Hazard is so lax in tracking back?
Against Shakhtar Hazard did try to defend but he was always miles behind Srna. And even if he was back he was easily beaten. 
So while it is exciting to play Mata, Oscar and Hazard together, against the strong teams that left-sided weakness -- even with Cole instead of Bertrand -- will emerge.
