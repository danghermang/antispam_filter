Buck, I'm right here, there is no need to talk about me in the third person=
. =A0I see that you have now posted the message you said you wrote last nig=
ht but weren't going to post, but you sent to me privately, saying, "I didn=
't post this because it is insulting and I don't mean to be insulting," but=
 now apparently you do. =A0First of all, saying "I don't mean to be insulti=
ng" and then being insulting (e.g., "wake the fuck up") is still insulting.=
 Second, I will now paraphrase what I said to you privately. =A0Have you no=
t read or heard anything about the Bush elections? =A0Are you wearing some =
kind of "It can't happen here" blinders? =A0I think your "wake the fuck up"=
 to me is mis-aimed. I did not say ROMNEY IS DEFRAUDING VOTERS (although we=
 have already seen the video of his supporters doing this with their regist=
ration drives), what I did say was it is important that any indication that=
 Romney may be defrauding voters be investigated. =A0I don't think that is
 a very extreme position. =A0I do think that "wake the fuck up" is a very e=
xtreme position. =A0Please take your rudeness elsewhere, and I'll take my e=
fforts to have this issue recognized elsewhere.

I think it's important to have transparency in election administration to a=
ssure fair elections.=A0 One problem with a lack of transparency is that it=
 engenders accusations that may or may not be false but for which truth or =
falsehood cannot be determined.

I like going to prime source instead of relying on any third party research=
 and reporting.=A0 I'm conversant with things like SEC 10-Ks etc and tried =
to research Hart Intercivic ownership.=A0 Problem is that Hart Intercivic a=
ppears not to be publicly held so they seem not have any requirement for re=
porting their ownership.=A0 In any case there is nothing readily available =
about it.=A0 To me that's a problem because there is no way for the public =
to know about potential conflicts of interest.=A0 The one thing that is vis=
ible on the Hart website is that 3 of 5 directors are from HIG Capital, whi=
ch gives them control of the company.=A0 The connections between HIG Capita=
l and Bain are pretty clear, with one of the HIG Capital founders a former =
partner at Bain.=A0 It's enough to raise questions that need to be addresse=
d.

How important are fair elections?=A0 How necessary is transparency in count=
ing votes to ensure fairness?

Is it a problem when the CEO of a company that sells electronic voting mach=
ines that cannot be inspected by the public chairs the election campaign fo=
r a candidate and states publicly "I am committed to doing everything in my=
 power to delivering electoral votes to my candidate"?=A0 (google O'Dell Di=
ebold Ohio Bush 2004 if you think I'm making that up)

How do we protect the ability of voters to be sure their votes will be coun=
ted fairly no matter which way they are cast?

Are we of like mind about those questions at least?
