					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>A B=
ig Day In The World Of Microsoft</strong></span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">October 26 =
=96 the release of Microsoft=92s next operating system, Windows 8, is final=
ly upon us.  The 26th also marks the release of Microsoft=92s new tablet, t=
he Surface.  In case you=92re wondering =96 this is a big day for Microsoft=
.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The biggest=
 news is probably the release of Windows 8 itself, an operating system that=
 many are claiming will be a complete game changer in the world of PC to mo=
bile computing.  In fact, this is Microsoft=92s first attempt at creating a=
n operating system that will run on PCs, tablets, <em>and </em>phones.  Win=
dows 8 features an interface (formally known as =93Metro=94=85 and that=92s=
 the name I=92m sticking with for now) that is vastly different from the de=
sktops many of us are familiar with.  8 starts out in the Metro interface, =
which includes a series of tiles and applications.  Some of these tiles eve=
n have live updating information, depending on what that particular app is.=
  Metro is built with touchscreens in mind and includes the large tiles to =
make it easier access each individual app.  You can also have separate =93p=
ages=94 of tiles that can be accessed by a simple swipe, or in the PC versi=
on=92s case, a click of the mouse.  The apps dedicated to each tile can eit=
her be built-in Windows or software applications, such as web browsers and =
photo viewers, or apps downloaded from Windows Store.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The next bi=
g release to go along with Windows 8 is the Surface tablet.  The first Surf=
ace tablet to be released will feature a 10.6&#8243; display, start off at =
32GB with an expandable microSDXC card slot, and will run on Windows RT.  W=
indows RT is a scaled-down version of Windows 8 built to run on the tablet=
=92s ARM CPU.  Later versions of the Surface tablet will feature larger sto=
rage and use an Intel CPU.  These =93Pro=94 versions will also be running a=
 full edition of Windows 8 Pro, have more RAM, and include a higher resolut=
ion screen.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Be sure to =
keep reading Tech Tips in the coming days and weeks as we continue to take =
a more in-depth look at Windows 8, the Surface tablet, and whether or not W=
indows 8 is right for <em>you!</em></span></p>

What Did Apple Just <em>Do?</em></strong></span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The release=
 of Windows 8 isn=92t the only thing causing waves in the tech world.  Appl=
e also had some big news of its own that it released earlier this week.</sp=
an></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The biggest=
 news?  The new iPad Mini.  So what is it?  To put it in simple terms, it=
=92s an iPad =96 only smaller.  A more in-depth look reveals a new tablet t=
hat comes in with a 7.9&#8243; screen, 7.2mm width, and a weight of only 0.=
7 lbs.  The Mini starts off at $329 for its 16GB Wi-Fi only model and finis=
hed off at $659 for the 64GB model and cellular capability.  It will also i=
nclude a resolution comparable to the iPad 2 and not the newer iPad=92s =91=
retina display=92. Speaking of the new iPad=85</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The =93new =
iPad=94 got an update as well.  The tablet, which was only released six mon=
ths ago, received an upgrade to its camera, a faster processor, and 4G LTE =
capability.  The iPhone 5, released last month, was the first Apple device =
to finally make use of 4G LTE.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The iPad Mi=
ni kicks off pre-orders today (October 26) and the Wi-Fi only version will =
hit store shelves on November 2.  Models using cellular networks will be re=
leased in the few weeks after.</span></p>

Yeah, they're lightweight but the trouble is your ear has to be just the ri=

 that they stay. But they always end up falling out... so you have to jam '=
em so far into your ear that they're REALLY uncomfortable. <img align=3D"ri=

		<br />
		Let's face it, if earphones aren't comfortable, who <em>cares</em> how th=
ey sound, cuz you'll never wear 'em to ever find out! Well, these stream-li=
ned earphones really deliver not only on great sound but comfort too!<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Here's why these Stereo Earbuds work:</strong><br />
		<br />
		Each earpiece features a <font color=3D"blue"><strong><em>soft silicone e=
arpad</em></strong></font> and they will fit in almost any ear. They create=
 a slight suction - so when you place the earpiece in your ear it stays the=
re ...comfortably, and doesn't fall out!<br />

		<font color=3D"#ff0000"><strong><em>These truly are a have a great set of=
 earphones that you can take where ever you go!</em></strong></font> In fac=
t, you can use these at your computer desk if you're working on your comput=
er late at night or early in the morning and you need to keep the sound dow=
n.<br />
		<br />
		And the cord is long enough (4 foot) without being too long so as to get =
tangled and in the way (another small point but something I've noticed as a=
 problem with other earphones I've tried!)<br />
		<br />
		And in case you were wonderin', this is the common plug (3.5 mm) that fit=
s into the front and your computer and most other audio devices, like porta=
ble radios, laptops, cd /dvd/mp3 players, iPods etc.<br />
