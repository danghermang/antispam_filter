Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Complete bird phylogenetic tree
I haven't read the full paper, only the abstract.  There is some 
controversy as to the accuracy of the tree.  Apparently they put the 
tree together using currently known sequences.  However a lot of those 
sequences are only mitochondrial sequences which are rather limited 
(partly simply due to the size of the mitochondrial genome).  That 
limitation means that for a lot of the linkages the evidence is somewhat 
flimsy.  In addition for some 30% of bird species there is no DNA 
sequence data of any sort.   In that case they relied on published 
morphological and paleontological data and we know how reliable that is.

Cheers

Andrew
