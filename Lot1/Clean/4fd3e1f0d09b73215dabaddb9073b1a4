Usability is one thing: in general where native ipv6 is provided, it mostly
works fine and most problems aren't related to the access layer.  But as
you correctly point out, it's simply not available for most end users.

Please don't be dismissive about this discussion.  There is a serious issue
here relating to availability of a resource which provides significant
benefit to many people and organisations in the RIPE service region.

It's less of a deck-chair discussion and more of a discussion about
life-boat seats - the relevant point being that there is a small quantity
of seats left and the crew/operators have bagged the lot for themselves,
leaving the passengers stranded on a sinking ship.

Now one way or another that ship will sink and we all know it, but in the
interim it is unreasonable to expect that end users who want PI are going
to be happy about the situation.
