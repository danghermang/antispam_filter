Subject:[Jukebox-list] AMI F,G, 120, 200
Thanks for the input, although I still don't know the weight.  I
guesstimated 350-450 and it was about $30 difference with the shipper.  My
first jukebox was a JEL 200 which I still have.  But I've added a Seeburg B
that was in great condition and very reliable, sounds great with the
Pickering 0345 cartridge. I've completely restored an 1800 Wurlitzer and it
sounds good, have a stepper and working wallbox, also seeburg C  in the
middle of restoration, and Seeburg G waiting its turn, also a very clean W
2800 that was cosmetically great, but someone used WD-40 or eq. to gum up
everything.  Took that apart and cleaned, rebuilt the the amp and it plays
great.     Of course all of this was with the great help and knowledge of
Dr. Ron Tyler who got me started in this hobby.  So again thanks to all the
jukebox, vending machine people that keep this great hobby going. 

Wm.
