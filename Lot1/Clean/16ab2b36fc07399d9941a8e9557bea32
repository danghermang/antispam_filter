But nowadays with crash test standards there is no way a "built from the ground up" 4 wheeled freeway capable EV will get DOT approval without $$$$$$$ spent on crash tests etc.
Crumple zones, airbags etc take lots of engineering and add weight and complexity to the vehicle.

The barriers to entry are prohibitive for all but the big players.

The Nissan Leaf which meets modern crash test standards can only go 100 miles with a 24kwh pack....so you'd have to make a much lighter car to go 273 miles on 26kwh....I just don't see it happening anytime soon for an affordable price with decent battery life and safety compliance.
