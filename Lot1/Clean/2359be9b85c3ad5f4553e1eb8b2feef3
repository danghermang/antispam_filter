It sounds like a flux joint or cold joint.  There was a small amount of
oxidation on the terminal and it wasn't heated long enough at the
factory for the flus to react with it and ensure a good joint.  The flux
just melted and coated the switch contact and/or wire acting as an
insulator.  Enough of the wire was touching to make contact and the flux
held it in place.

Over time, moisture penetrated the joint and was absorbed by the flux
and possibly sucked into the capillaries in the wire, if stranded.
Eventually the contact between the parts was broken through years of
oxidation, water absorption, temperature cycling, etc.

When you touched it with a hot iron you boiled the trapped moisture,
hence the blow-up.  Filing fixed it, you may have been able to apply new
flux and heat to cut through the oxidation as well.
