Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Peterson field guide app for iPhone/iPad/iPod
 Touch free for short time
Hi all,

At this price it is worth downloading even if you never go to the US
because the US field guides are not necessarily just for the US.

If you want an e-guide field guide for migratory waders etc to supplement
the Morecombe e-guide the US ones are good because they show different
plumage stages and views.

cheers
