"3C continuous is, shall we say, optimistic. Even 1C continuous is pushing
it."

Do you have data showing that?  I am not aware of any data on cells showing
the effect of discharge current magnitude on cycle life.  Would like to see
some.
 
"The cycle life ratings for these cells is when they are used at .3C, thats 
three tenths C."

The CALB spec states 0.3C for charge/discharge, but it does not specifically
say their spec for cycle life is based on this.  It does not say what the
spec'ed cycle life is based on, other than DoD.
 
"Without pack heating expect a big hit on EV performance in cold weather." 

I've kept my cells heated to about 60 - 65 F while the car is parked in the
garage for the last 3 winters, and noticed very little difference in
performance in winter versus summer.  Mostly what I notice is the greater
stiffness and friction loss in the drive train in winter.  I don't think
they need to be heated to higher temperature than this for good performance.
The battery boxes have 1/2" insulation, and the cells will generally remain
above 50 F when the car is left parked outside for 4 - 5 hours at temps in
mid 20's F.  

IMO low temperatures are easier to deal with than high temperatures, since
heat is not very efficiently removed from the cells with only forced
convection.
