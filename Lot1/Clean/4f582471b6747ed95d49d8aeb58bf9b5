Subject:[burners] Can anyone have Patton boots I could borrow?
Hi!

I'm putting on a one-man show next Tuesday, October 30. It is a one-man
musical about personal productivity ... And zombies. I play a
megalomaniacal dictator who is raising a (productive, organized) zombie
army to take over the world. You can read about it at
http://worklessanddomore.com.

I'm having difficulty with my general's costume. I need to find a pair of
Patton-like cavalry boots, men's size 8.5-9. They're simple leather boots
that come up over the calf to the knee. They cost ~ $500 new, and I only
need them for the one day of performance, and the rehearsal beforehand.
(E.g.

)

Is there anyone on the list who might be able to help out? If not, do you
know anyone who might be able to?

Thank you very much,


Stever
