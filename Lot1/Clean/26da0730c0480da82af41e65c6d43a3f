Opinion formation - as you described it - is a process over one's mind, 
right?
What about groups? Do they have a collective opinion formation process also?

IMHO the most relevant part is to compare different opinions with eachother. 
The discussion should evolve from a infinite amount of opinions into just 
some variations. Therfore group building processes might be fundamental to 
reach consensus. Or in other words like Slash said:

IMHO it is one part of the puzzle and the basics needs to be reflected 
somehow in the domain model standardization. But the details are to be 
handled by the plug-ins or individual implementations. So I think that can 
be addressed by

participant has opinion
group consits of participants
group has position

And of course, the process to get to a groups position is far more complex 
;o)

What do you think?

Cheers
