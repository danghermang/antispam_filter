Subject:[Birding-Aus] Recent pics
Hi All,

Just uploaded a few more pics from last weekend at Bunyip SP (Vic) and a
couple of weeks ago at WTP.

It has been a great spring so far this year, with lots of activity in Bunyip
SP and plenty of great birds about.
Lots of Scarlet HE, Satin Flycatcher, Cicadabird, White-winged Triller,
Brush Cuckoo, Beautiful Firetail etc. It was also nice to see Black-faced
Monarch, Large-billed Scrubwren, Rose Robin, Brown Gerygone etc at Glen
Nayook near Neerim South (was a bit gloomy here for photography though!)=8A

Just go to www.gregoakleywildpix.com and then "Latest" - October 2012

Cheers,
Greg
