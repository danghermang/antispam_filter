Piggy-backing on bigger events is generally a good idea for small 
hackfests with a good % of pure volunteers.

However, as for today the State of the Map conference doesn't even have 
time/location defined, but it's quite certain that it will be in 2H 
2013. Within the February-March time frame suggested by Erik there are 
options like

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/FOSDEM
Feb 2-3 @ Brussels (Belgium)

OSM got a booth en previous years. No idea about 2013 but FOSDEM is 
anyway a good pole of attraction for all kind of FLOSS developers - 
ourselves included. In fact we are trying to build critical mass around 
this event - see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Events/FOSDEM

Sadly there is no geolocation DevRoom but if both projects want to 
organize something right before the event (e.g Friday, Feb 1st)...


Later than that other options could be

* http://whereconf.com/where2012 San Francisco, April 2-4.
* http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Linuxtag Berlin, May 22-25.
* http://wherecamp.de/ Berlin, probably June.

The OSM project has more events listed at 
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Events but there are no 2013 events 
listed right now?

There is also http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Conferences but most of 
those events happen in 2H 2013.

What about a combo around FOSDEM and Where Conference, focusing each on 
EU/US communities with a few privileged sponsored contributors able to 
attend and connect both?
