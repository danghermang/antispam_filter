Subject:Re: [Chelsea] DONETSK - A MEDICAL OPINION [TOCFCWS]
As I'm won't do I may have been slightly misleading. The original report
in Sept 2011 stated the following:

~~~~~
Premier League and FA rules state club doctors must be registered with
the GMC. A statement from the GMC said: "We can confirm Paco Biosca is
not currently registered to practise in this country."

A Chelsea spokesman said: "Dr Biosca's registration is being processed
and all of our contact with the GMC has been in regard to completing
that as soon as possible."
~~~~~

So, rather not being qualified, he wasn't registered, which presumably
is in order for his credentials to be verified.

Just so that we're clear.

Also, I'm not entirely sure Spain is an obscure country, though it may
be, medically-speaking...
