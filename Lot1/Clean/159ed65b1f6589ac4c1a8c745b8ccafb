and pins when I worked there. Phone is 888-289-4277.

Hello,
  Until I find the correct button selector assy for my continental 2 I am 
going to make a mm3 button assembly work.  I have a continental 2 manual, 
but I could use the following.  Advanced wiring info on the continental 2 
wiring? Colors what each plug is for.  The same for the mm3. And where can I 
get plug housing and pins or just pigtailed plugs cut off something else?  I 
think I need for sure 12 male 12 female 9 m and f, 3 male, and a 9 female.
p.s. I don't have the door so I can weld anything up to house the buttons 
and the glass/plastic I have.
Thanks
Ed
