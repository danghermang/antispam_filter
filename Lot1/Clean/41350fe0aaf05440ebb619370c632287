Sure---RTFM--
The motor can not be "at odds" with anything--it has no brain. It can only do what it's told to do, by the switching or relays---Ron Rich

Greetngs.

I was wondering if you could tell me if the same basic approach could be
applied to a Wurly 1700 HF that I have here? I got the mechanism badly
messed up and out of synch trying to fix an issue. I think the motor is at
odds with the mechanism direction somehow.

thanks...

Yes you can step through an entire change cycle by turning the knurled nut
at 
the rear of the changer motor. When the crank arm is stopped by a raised 
selector pin, the motor reverses direction which begins the lift arm
operation. 
You need to read the full description of how the change cycle operates in
your 
service manual. At the time the crank arm is stopped by a selector pin,
there 
are both electrical and mechanical "switches" that take place to make that 
happen. Too lengthy to describe here in detail. You can manually operate the

full change cycle without actually applying power to the motor but you will
need 
to fully replicate the entire change cycle process. It is a positive first
step 
that you can clockwise-rotate the record basket this way.
