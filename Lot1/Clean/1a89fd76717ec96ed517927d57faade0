Subject:[meteorite-list] Open Access Geology Textbook Online
For the avocational meteorite collector, there is
a rather nice open access geology textbook. It
is "Earth's Dynamic Systems Web Edition 1.0" T

http://www.earthds.info/

Someone obviously put a lot of time and effort 
into it and is a good introductory text for the 
interested layman.

Best wishes,

Paul H.
