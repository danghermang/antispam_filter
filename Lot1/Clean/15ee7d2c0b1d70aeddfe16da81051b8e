There are already battery leasing and service companies. Many 
industrial EV users and golf courses would rather lease their batteries, 
and have someone else worry about the maintenance. So, they pay $X a 
month for someone to do it all for them. You might check around in your 
area to find one of these companies, and visit or talk to them about how 
it's going. They are the natural ones to take on an expanded battery 
leasing program for on-road EVs.
