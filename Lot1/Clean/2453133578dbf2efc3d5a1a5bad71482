I personally thank Ray for this useful program. The wonderful thing about this community is that there are so many talented people that do not even work for Flex Radio systems make the Flex a much better radio product due to their efforts.

I approached Ray about this functionality many months ago and now he has made it reality. 

Ray, if you ever make it to the Silicon Valley, please let me buy you dinner.

Thank you so very much for this application. It makes it so much easier than hand editing the XML file.

BandTextEditor v1.0.1 has been released.  This version fixes a bug where the
program would crash if you tried to edit a table without loading a default
table.
