Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] meteorites and TAXES
Hi Adam and Paul,

        I have long been told (by those who should know)
that finding anything of value does not open you up to
taxes UNTIL you sell it (unless, of course, it is money
you find! -  I'll pay the taxes gladly if anyone wants to
tell me where to find some of the latter).

        Personally I find it strange that nearly everyone
Lauds a veteran (which I understand) but despises taxes,
Which I don't get at all. Of course taxes are no fun, but
If we want fire departments, education, police, functional
Roads, bridges, etc, (not to mention the military people
Seam to adore - though we spend as much as the next
Highest 15 nations combined to on our military - much
of which is  based on an obsolete warfare concept - and
uses 42% of each tax dollar we pay). Taxes are essential
to keep all he essential things going.

        BTW, cutting funding of PBS ("getting rid of Big Bird
And all preschool and the informational and artistic programming
Provided for PBS would "save" about 1/10th of 1% of what we
Spend on the Military.....similar to cutting food programs
For poor kids in school....very strange priorities, indeed)

        Best regards, Michael
