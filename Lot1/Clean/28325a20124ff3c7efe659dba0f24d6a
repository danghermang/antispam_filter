John Kraus did not change the conductor OD in his textbook example for a 
1/2WL, center-fed dipole when he stated that its (free space) radiation 
resistance would drop from 73 ohms to ~ 65 ohms, when its end-end length was 
reduced to achieve an input reactance of zero ohms -- i.e., first resonance.
