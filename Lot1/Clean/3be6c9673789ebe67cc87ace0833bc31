I should have mentioned that kta-ev replaced the original core with one for
lower voltage.  I've always found them easy to deal with.  However, since I
had to pull the dash to replace the heater core I wanted to ensure it worked
well the next time, so I went with two heaters.  The core from kta was too
large to fit two of them, but considerably smaller than the original core.
