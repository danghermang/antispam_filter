Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] Holbrook for sale on Facebook
Hola,
Everyone should have the benefit of the doubt, but I'm awaiting other
photos.  Even stones like Bouse and those "Mifflins" had to have a
"finder."  At the moment, nothing more than suspect.  It could have
been cleaned strangely or just be a very odd Holbrook.  But...when
things stick out, it's best to be cautious.
Regards,
Jason
