Subject:Re: [child_lit] Who are you today? (snurched from YALSA-BK)
Dear GraceAnne - fortunately trick or treat isn't yet big in Australia. I
found some tiny Moomin biscuits, which I'm sure wouldn't have impressed
them, but no one came to the door - I guess as the oldies in the street we
fill in for the wicked witch!

Anyway I was going to say, isn't that Margaret Atwood poem stunning? There
are some that just speak to you, aren't there? But I'd forgotten that line
as such. Brilliant.

Regards, virignia

Subject: [child_lit] Who are you today? (snurched from YALSA-BK)

The teen book discussion list YALSA-BK has asked its members if they dressed
up to go to work today, and asked who they were. There are three 10th
Doctors so far, and my favorite, the woman who got a WAAF uniform on eBay
and who is going as Verity in Code Name: Verity.

How about you, child_lit folk? Who are you dressing as for Halloween?

GraceAnne, who has a pumpkin fascinator to wear when kids come trick or
treating.
