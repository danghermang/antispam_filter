So which are the four in the running? ;)

I've rolled back my fresh Ubuntu 12.10 install due to it not supporting 
nVidia drivers properly yet (it defaults to nouveau in the hope that 
x-swat catch up and compile a set for the latest X they saddled 12.10 with).

I must recommend Mint's Cinnamon desktop. I'm running it on my old 
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with the Unity 2D Dash. It's very quick and pretty bug 
free (so far) - better than Unity & Gnome Shell which is slow on my 
system and very crashy.
