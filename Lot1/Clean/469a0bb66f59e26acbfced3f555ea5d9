Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] 1/2-wave vertical really needs a
	groundplane?
Folks:
   While I personally subscribe to the view conveyed by w8ji there
are detractors.  The argument starts like this, "Kirchhoff's law doesn't always
apply".  Then hands are waved and measurements presented.
   I happen to think Kirchhoff's law does apply but the arguments can
be compelling.  I know I can build an antenna which has radiating
elements which have NO direct electrical connection to the feed line.
Somehow, currents are induced and therefore Kirchhoff's circuit
law doesn't apply.
   I expect the physicists to say something like "Kirchhoff's circuit laws
apply only to static circuits".  Anyone?

   Just a flare to engage the brain cells.

The transmission line does not radiate (very much) so it is not a counter poise and does not interact with a "ground" so it is not radials. (etc)

The link below has an interesting discussion of this subject, including a section titled "Can we end-feed a halfwave antenna, or end-feed any antenna, without a ground or counterpoise?"
