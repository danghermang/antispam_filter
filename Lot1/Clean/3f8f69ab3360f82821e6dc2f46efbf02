Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] NASA SETI Misappropriation of Tax Payer Funds
Hi Adam and List,

It's always the poor and middle class that get hit the hardest.  The
super-rich have excellent accountants and financial advisors, and they
take advantage of loopholes and grey areas that the average person is
not aware of.

Adam, are you taking full advantage of your allowed deductions?  For
example, if you have an area in your home that dedicated to your
business, you can deduct tax burden based on the square footage of the
home office.  They actually assign a dollar value to each square foot
of your office, so take advantage of that.

The computer you are reading this on - deductible as a business
expense.  Also, if you computer is used for internet-based commerce,
you can also deduct a portion of your internet provider fees.

You can also shelter some of your profits by putting it into a trust
for a grandchild or relative.

Going to Walmart to buy packing materials?  Not only can you write off
the materials you buy, you can write off the gas you spent to drive
there.

Do you conduct business with dealers or collectors via telephone?  If
so, you can write off the phone bill as a business expense.

If you don't already have one, get yourself a really good accountant
who knows all of the loopholes and will help you take advantage of
them.

Or, as a last resort measure, do what the ultra-wealthy do : transfer
some of your cash to an offshore or foreign bank.  Or, stick a giant
wad of cash into a safety deposit box and let it sit there - it won't
gather interest, but it will be invisible for tax purposes.

People talk about how high the tax rates are for businesses and
corporations, but very few of the big companies pay anything close to
the tax rate.  The General Electric company recently got a REFUND and
the last couple of years, their tax burden has been well under 10%.
Try finding a company that pays the full tax rate - it's difficult to
do, although many mom and pop small businesses have to pay.  But
generally speaking, the bigger the company, the bigger the money
involved, the more they manipulate their finances to dodge their tax
burden.  Go down the list of Fortune 500 companies, and I would wager
that only a small handful of them pay more than a 20% rate.  Some of
them pay nothing or next to nothing.

The little guys have to pay so much, in part, because the big guys
aren't paying their share -

s/

Read that linked article and you'll see what I mean.

Back to meteorites - yes, the blimp/airship/whatever is a total waste
of money.  What is next?  Are we going to bring Gary Powers back from
the dead and have him fly a U2 over strewnfields?  It's downright
silly.  Sure, you might be able to see a large impact crater from an
airship, but it would have to be really BIG and such a feature could
be easily spotted on the ground.  I'll change my name to Nancyboy
Fancypants if a single meteorite is found by using a blimp.

I am generally very supportive of NASA and SETI.  But this blimp
nonsense seems like an attempt to garner media attention and not a
method to find meteorites.

Best regards and happy huntings,

MikeG
