Subject:[CT Birds] Hosta seeds
Thought I'd share an observation from last week: the snow preceded my annual yard clean-up, and so the seed heads were still on my hosta when the snow arrived.  Then I saw a collection of many birds -- juncoes, finches, sparrows, all feasting on the hosta seeds.  I didn't realize the birds liked them!  Nice to see they went to a good end.  Maybe that will be my excuse to leave them alone until spring...
