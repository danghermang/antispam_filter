Subject:Re: [child_lit] younger reader/MG titles with girl protagonists
I know that 1981 is not within the last 10 years (though sometimes I have
difficulty believing that...) but my younger daughter read and re-read and
re-read again *Ronia the Robber's Daughter *by Astrid Lindgren. And she was
clearly not the only one deeply touched by this book--I recently met a
2-year-old named Ronia, and learned that her (German-born) mother had
indeed named her for "the robber's daughter."
