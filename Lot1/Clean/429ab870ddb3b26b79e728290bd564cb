Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Dead 1500
Maybe someone with some experience here will volunteer to help you out.  I 
could look at it, but finding replacement parts could be difficult.  For 
example, those tiny relays might be hard to find.

From what I remember (I sold my 1500 in anticipation of my 6500), a lot of 
the 1500 has fairly standard parts.  Not having a schematic makes it a 
little more difficult to work on, but the signal flow was fairly obvious.

Have you looked at the board for physical damage?  Are the voltage 
regulators blown?  Rather than junking it, maybe someone (Flex or other) can 
help you out.  If you are left completely out of luck, I could take a look 
at it, as long as you pay shipping, and don't expect a guarantee.
good luck & 73,
Terry, WB4JFI

Looks like I'm off the air for awhile.

My beloved Flex 1500 was taken out when a power supply shorted during the CQ 
WW DX SSB test on the weekend.

Originally looked like a push-to-talk line had gone down but seems the 
damage to the board was much more extensive.

Radioworld here in Canada says both the 1500 and the power supply aren't 
worth the repair costs :)

Not a happy camper but it is what it is.
