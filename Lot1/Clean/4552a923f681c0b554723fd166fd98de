it also tells that if we run this smallest box cooler, at the lowest speed(=
zero ohm at R1 =3D 2000rmpm)  =

then we maybe can have up to +10=B4C in boil temp as maximum inside the bat=
terybox, or heat exhanger =

but I guess it might need a fan on the compressor unit also if you have hig=
h ambient temperatures. =

Good thing is: COP will go up when you can increase the evap temp in the ba=
ttery box. =

So at +10=B4C  We find in the datasheet: 136 or 169 W cooling from 70W inpu=
t. =

( the small BD35F @R134 medium)
 If this is enough in your cases? I can not know. =


But One "easy"(cheap) way to test how much cooling power you need can be =

to use the machine from an old normal 230Vac(110?)fridge with similar =

performance (same flow, as BD35 at 2000 RPM, and use R134A). =

Might be found for free before scrap/recycling when they change *all* in th=
e same time at apartment buildnings.

I beleve Compressors from scraped indoor-water-coolers, might be perfect =

in evaporator temp-range (you should look for "HBP" type
 of compressors =

for the dessert battery cooler. Maybe they are to small? I dont
 know. =

If so..use some more in parallell? hehe..  :-)   =


------

This leads me in to next id=E9a..  an old one.
Can you maybe have that normal cheap/free AC compressor connected =

to grid at home when charging, so you will cool it +  "store the cold" at =

the same event,  is it possible to store enough for over a day or so ? =


A Wild guess, it might work, or not....  :-)
-If we use pure Glycerol for our safe battery temperature buffer material, =

as the "storage of cold", it might be better than water.

it should have about +17.8=B4C in melting point if I understand it right. (=
Wpedia) =

isnt that a perfect natural temperature buffer for the cells? Also Non toxi=
c.  =


Cool..I must try to find some and test the melting point of pure Glycerol.
(also an interesting fact was found, that in a water antifreez-blend by 56%=
  does not expand at all when it did freeze!)

Our energy usage and the COP,just based on temperatures now, =

will be significant better compared to produce normal "water-ice". =

and Glycerol-ICE "stores" about 200kJ/kg acording to WPedia, =

water-ice has a higher level in its phase change. About 333kJ/kg




But..  water-Evaporative cooling in top of box.. seems best to me, if possi=
ble.
-cheap, safe, almost no energy needed, and we get the amazing energy level =
at 2257 kJ/kg of "stored cold" ! =



However this will not help at all to keep my lithium cells ABOVE my prefere=
d level +10 to 15=B4C here, as Glycerol might do..  :-)
yes, it adds kg, but cheaper compared to add up ore battery or fuel just fo=
r for cooling/heating them, it seems so wrong to me.
