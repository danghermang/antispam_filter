Subject:[Dixielandjazz] 2012 Franz Jackson Jazz Celebration & "Franz
 Jackson: Milestone" CD Release Party
November 10th is the date for the 2012 Franz Jackson Jazz Celebration in Dowagiac, MI! 



The 6th Annual Franz Jackson Jazz Celebration will mark the 100th anniversary of the late Chicago jazz legend Franz Jackson's birth. 

The Jazz Celebration's tradition of bringing world-class musicians to the Southwestern Michigan community continues with this year's performers CGQ (The Chris Greene Quartet) from Chicago and jazz vocalist (and St. Joe, Michigan native) Jenna Mammina from California! 

The Jazz Celebration starts at 5:00pm and then stick around for more great music and celebration at 8:00pm when the CD Release Party for the new CD "Franz Jackson: Milestone" kicks off! 

This CD, produced through a grassroots effort via Kickstarter.com by Mr. Jackson's daughter, features the live music from his 95th birthday concert in November 2007. It was the last major concert Mr. Jackson performed before his passing in May, 2008 at age 95. 

A number of performers from the recording will be on hand to officially celebrate its release including Chicago jazz staples Eric Schneider, Yves Francois, Bob Dogan, Dan Shapera and Judi K as well as local favorite Billy "Stix" Nicks. All musicians from the 95th birthday concert have been invited back for the party, so there's no telling who might show up and jam! 

Tickets are $25 for adults and $10 for children ages 12-17 (kids under 12 are free). Ticket price includes all entertainment from 5 to 10pm. 

A portion of the proceeds from this year's Jazz Celebration will benefit Charity Music, Inc., a Michigan-based non-profit that provides new and used musical instruments to homeless and disadvantaged children so that they may pursue their musical ambitions. 


"Milestone" will officially be released on November 1st, what would've been Franz's 100th birthday. You can pre-order your copy of "Milestone" as well as purchase tickets to the Jazz Celebration and CD Release party at www.franzjackson.bandcamp.com.
