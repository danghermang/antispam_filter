Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Another Crystal Radio Question
Oliver,

David's comments are correct.

To go a bit further, the capture area theorem tells us that a tuned receiver 
captures all the power in the incident wave over a circle of radius about 1 
wavelength around the receiver.

If two radios are located within one wavelength of one another, they will 
interfere destructively, and each will hear a smaller signal than if the 
other radio weren't present.

AM wavelengths are long enough that this effect is not entirely negligible.
If two cars pass one another while tuned to the same AM station, there will 
be bit of a fadeout on their radios.   This usually goes away as traffic 
changes, so you attribute these fadeouts to the poor quality of AM signals, 
etc.

The cellphone industry needs to be able to deliver signals to two people 
standing fairly close to one another.   This means that the carrier 
frequency needs to be less than the size of a person.

The cellphone frequencies of 1-2 GHZ correspond to wavelengths of 15-30 cm, 
which are OK in this sense.

With much longer wavelengths, people would complain about fadeouts in 
crowded areas.....

Subject: [Antenna-discussion] Another Crystal Radio Question

This is probably not fitting into the crystal radio topic presently
being discussed so I'll list it separately:

If a one watt AM transmitter is being received on a nearby crystal
radio at comfortable headphone listening level - (let's call that
1/50th of a watt going into the headphones, if that's a reasonable
estimate) - What happens if 51 or more nearby crystal radios are
listening?  Surely the total power output of all the crystal radios
can't exceed the transmitted power!  I once asked a similar question
here, but must confess to not understanding how this works.
