Ghastly news ahead...

If you're not prepared to read some difficult news, please do not read the next thread in this post--it will contain some difficult material which some on this list might rather not hear. 

Please continue further in this thread only if you are prepared to read a difficult news story. 

Please ping me off-list if anyone has private questions or would like to talk.
