Please report any issue you find.

We will resolve any compatibility issue if it can be resolved while
maintaining the integrity and correctness of data.

The latest snapshot jar features several enhancements to DATE and
TIMESTAMP capabilities.
New functions include ADD_MONTHS, LAST_DAY, MONTHS_BETWEEN and others.
Datetime arithmetic has been improved for compatibility with database
engines such as Oracle, which do not fully support INTERVAL semantics.
Examples reported last week now work more like what is expected with
other databases. The SYSDATE function returns a TIMESTAMP with SECOND
resolution. The following expressions use a DAY TO SECOND interval unit
when the unit is not specified.
SYSDATE - 5 is translaed to (SYSDATE - 5) DAY TO SECOND
SYSDATE - TRUNC(SYSDATE) is translated to the SQL Standard (SYSDATE -
TRUNC(SYSDATE)) DAY TO SECOND
All datetime subtraction still results in INTERVAL types, therefore you
need to cast the INTERVAL to a number type if you want to convert or
compare it to a number. For example:
SELECT CASE WHEN 1>2 THEN CAST(ATIMESTAMP - TRUNC(SYSDATE) AS
NUMBER) ELSE 999 END
The cast treats the largest INTERVAL unit, which is DATE in this case,
as the significant unit. It therefore returns the number of days with a
fractional day.
