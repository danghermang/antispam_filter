But I am being classified as a Small not because of what I requested or use, but because of what I was allocated as an early adopter of IPv6.  Had the smaller X-Small IPv6 been available at the time, that is what I would have requested.  I did not really need a /32 IPv6.

Also, this should be done without forcing these early adopter ISPs to give up and renumber their /32 IPv6 space - we are now actively using our IPv6 space.  Renumbering would be problematic for us.

Mike - 
 
  Thanks for clear feedback on the proposed fee changes;
  we've had a few folks now make note of this concern and 
  it will be explicitly considered in any path forward.

Thanks again,
