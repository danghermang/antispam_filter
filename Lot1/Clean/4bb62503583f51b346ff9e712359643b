After two androids, a milestone and a desire, I went the other way and grabbed an iPhone 4s - the mrs got one through work and after a week of sneering at it realised it did everything I wanted and pretty well, then caved and got one myself. 

Android for me was a frustrating mess - from things being clunky to being outright mental. Not being able to answer my phone (slide damn you, SLIDE!!) was the final straw.

I'll probably go back after a few more iterations.
