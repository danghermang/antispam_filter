Subject:[LUG] Xubuntu install problems
I'm trying to install xubuntu from cd onto an old pc. The install fails 
and sends me to a desktop to 'investigate further' without actually 
telling me what the fatal error it was that stopped the install.
I cant find any log files - any clues on how to ferret the problem out?
