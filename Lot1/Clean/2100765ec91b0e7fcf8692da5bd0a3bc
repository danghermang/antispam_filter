This is why I want to see him employed as a wing back or defensive mid. His
personality means he will continue to take risks and play with impetuosity.
If he has a screen behind him he will be a huge asset with his maruading
runs, skill, and ability to intercept and break down opposition play. But
he cannot be relied upon as the last line of defence.
