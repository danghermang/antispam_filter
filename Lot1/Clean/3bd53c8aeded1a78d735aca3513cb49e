Subject:[CT Birds] BROWN PELICAN Stratford Point
At about 13:35 a juvenile came over Stratford Point's parking lots too
close for me to photograph. It went over the lighthouse, spiraling upwards
for a minute or two, while I snapped off a few shots. Heading WEST. Maybe
the same as this morning's in the east?
