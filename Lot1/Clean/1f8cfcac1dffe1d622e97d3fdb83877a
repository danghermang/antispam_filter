Subject:[Jukebox-list] Dismantling of Wurlitzer 2410
What is the procedure for dismantling of the jukebox to get to the
mechanisms for cleaning and lubrication? I am sure there is a proper
procedure that will minimize chance of harming the other componets.

I also am still trying to find a listing of the sequence of operations of
the 2410. I understand this should have been in my manual but it is not
there. Hopefully one of you could make a copy and and send it to me.

Thanks,

Pat
