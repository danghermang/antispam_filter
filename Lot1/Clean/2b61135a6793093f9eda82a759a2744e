Subject:Re: [CT Birds] White Pelican Rocky Neck

11/01/12 - Rocky Neck SP 1:30-2:30 PM, WHITE PELICAN well seen in marsh
(east side up against the reeds), hooded mergansers, Canada geese, mallards,
great black-backed gull, greater yellowlegs, belted kingfisher, great
egrets, great blue herons, eastern bluebirds, dark-eyed juncos, etc.  A
fellow joined me on the platform and said a park worker told him the pelican
had been there a couple days.

When I got to work I had a phone message from Russ Smiley, who had the
recently reported WHITE PELICAN about 2 p.m. at Rocky Neck State Park in
East Lyme. So that park apparently is open also.
