Subject:[meteorite-list] UK charges for opening packages?
Hi List,

I was wondering if this was a frequent occurrence or a recent
development: one of my UK clients was charged =A330 by UK customs as a
service fee for customs opening, examining, and repacking an item. It
was a priority mail small flat rate box.

Is this going to be become standard? Is there a way a client can
appeal the charge?
