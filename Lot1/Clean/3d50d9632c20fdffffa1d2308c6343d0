The presence of teardrops helps rule out Sharp-shinned.=A0 =


But the streaks in the Cooper's and Gos are quite different as well.=A0 =


The juv. Northern Goshawk has tear-shaped streaks, but they are larger, dar=
ker, and more prevalent or "denser",=A0 and continue further down towards t=
he belly.=A0 In many cases the leg feathers are more densely spotted and th=
ere is at least a row of spots in the undertail coverts.=A0 =


But streaks fade at a distance.=A0 For the Coop, that large warm tawny, buf=
fy head against a "white" belly is an impression that can be seen from cons=
iderable distance.=A0 The juv. Coop is a colorful, pretty, warmly-colored b=
ird.=A0 =


The more uniformally chocolate colored, darker Gos gives more of an impress=
ion that it may have flown from the lands of Mordor...

One question for Frank (and anyone else), who wrote:
>Note the tear-shaped streaks
Is the shape of the streaks helpful for distinguishing between the accipite=
rs?
