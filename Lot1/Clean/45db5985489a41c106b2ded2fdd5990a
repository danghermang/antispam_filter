Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Another Crystal Radio Question

I can't suggest an alternative experiment than the one you just did,
which seems right to me, and the answer is that the antennas in your
two radios will hardly couple at all, and definitely not by an amount
that can be detected by listening.
