Cray notches up two Urika graph analysis appliance sales
Will invest $15m in YarcData 'threadmonsters' in 2013
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/14/cray_yarcdata_investment_urika_sale=
s/

It has been a busy couple of weeks for supercomputer maker Cray, with
the rollout of the 27-petaflops "Titan" supercomputer, the debut of the
next-generation XC30 system, and the acquisition of sometime HPC rival
Appro International. News that Cray had sold two of its Urika big data
analytics appliances got a little lost in the shuffle, but the company
is finding buyers for the massively multithreaded systems.

Boiler Makers swing hammer at SC12, Team Taiwan tries for a three-peat
More contenders in battle for cluster domination
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/14/sc12_cluster_competition_/

Team Taiwan (from Taiwan=E2=80=99s National Tsing Hua University) has a cha=
nce
to become a three time Overall Award winner at the SC12 Student Cluster
Competition here in Salt Lake City. They notched their first win at
SC10 in New Orleans, repeated the feat the next year in Seattle, and
are now looking for the hat trick in Salt Lake. But, if you talk to
them, you=E2=80=99ll get the impression that they believe they=E2=80=99ll b=

Cluster Competition. These kids are from the University of Science and
Technology and are not only battling their cluster competitors, but are
also fighting jet-lag, 8.5 inches (21cm) of snow, and my inability to

Texans forget deep fryer, add GPUs to lasso data-crunching crown
Why marine bilge pumps are VITAL cluster computing tools
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/14/sc12_cluster_competition_texas/

Meet the 2012 edition of the Texas Longhorn Student Cluster Competition
team. This video was shot right after they received the scientific
application data sets and had begun their initial processing. We
discuss how they parcel up the work in their cluster and how they now
have tools that give them a much better idea of what they can (and
can=E2=80=99t) accomplish with their hardware. We also talk about why they
didn=E2=80=99t bring the immersive cooling (aka server deep fryer) gear that
they sported last year.

It's time, once again, to meet some more plucky contenders in the SC12
Student Cluster Competition.

Team Slippery Rock

We meet the Slippery Rock team for the first time. They=E2=80=99re competin=

the Mini Iron LittleFe division of the cluster-building contest. In the
video they explain their strategy for achieving the best solution for
the 10,000 city Traveling Salesman problem. Like most of the teams,
they=E2=80=99ll be using multiple approaches simultaneously in order to
determine which of the many algorithms available to them work best on

It's time to meet some of the Big Iron cluster war contenders. Team
Venus, the all-female Student Cluster Competition (SCC) team from the
University of the Pacific, tells us how they found their way into the
competition in their profile video below.

They also discuss how they=E2=80=99re looking to encourage women to enter S=

Dell to sell Brit firm's 'fastest in the world' HPC arrays
Deal inked, Xyratex gets chance to ride the elephant
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/14/dell_clusterstor/

Dell is going to resell Xyratex ClusterStor high-performance computing
arrays, which should be good news for the UK data-storage firm after
its recent Q4 tumble on the back of crummy enterprise demand and
tumbling disk drive sales.

ClusterStor is Xyratex's supercomputing and high-performance computing
(HPC) storage array, billed as the fastest HPC array in the industry.
There's background information here.

AMD fires off crazy-fast FirePro double-whammy GPU card
Aimed at servers and heavy-duty workstations
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/12/amd_firepro_s10000_gpu_card/

AMD, a company that knows a thing or two about building powerful
graphics processors, has whipped out a card that has more flops than
either Nvidia's K20 high-end GPUs or Intel's x86-based Xeon Phi
coprocessors.

That's one sure way to cut through all the noise that Nvidia and Intel
are making about their just-released offerings: performance.

Intel Xeon Phi battles GPUs, defends x86 in supercomputers
A hoard of wimpy Pentium cores do the math for brawny Xeons
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/12/intel_xeon_phi_coprocessor_launch/

Intel's Xeon Phi might have started out with the goal of creating an
x86-based graphics engine, but it ended up defending the x86
architecture's hegemony in high-performance computing against the
onslaught of GPU coprocessors from Nvidia and AMD.

However, it ends up being a battle among GPUs anyway =E2=80=93 but in a
different market than Intel, Nvidia, or AMD might have thought it would
be, seven years ago.

Mellanox stretches InfiniBand across campuses, metro areas
Adds baby FDR switch, grafts Layer 3 onto Ethernet switches
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/12/mellanox_switch_ufm_updates/

With InfiniBand on the march, taking market share away from Ethernet in
the upper echelons of the supercomputer racket, Mellanox Technology
could sit back and enjoy itself a little. But instead, the company is
tweaking its InfiniBand lineup to make its switches and adapters more
appealing and to keep InfiniBand rolling.

Accelerators tag team in Top500 supercomputer CPU smackdown
Titan cuts down Sequoia with Tesla K20X GPUs
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/12/top_500_supercomputers_nov_2012/

This fall's Top500 supercomputer sites ranking continues the smackdown
between massively parallel supercomputers based on CPUs and somewhat
less-massive machines using a mix of CPUs and accelerators. In this
round, the hybrid ceepie-geepies, which mix CPUs and GPU coprocessors,
have the CPU-only boxes on the ropes =E2=80=93 and the ceepie-xeephies, whi=

Nvidia launches not one but two Kepler2 GPU coprocessors
Uncloaks Tesla K20, K20X extreme oomphers for servers, workstations
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/12/nvidia_tesla_k20_k20x_gpu_coprocess=
ors/

The wait for the "Kepler2" GPU coprocessors based on the company's
GK100 GPUs is over. That's the good news.

The bad news is that you may have to hurt someone =E2=80=93 or call in a fa=
vor
at Nvidia =E2=80=93 to get your hands on one, because so many people are go=
ing
to be looking for one to goose their number-crunching. And you'll have
to get in line behind Cray, which is building the "Titan" and "Blue
Waters" 20-petafloppers using the devices.

Cray ends battle with Appro by ingesting it alive
If you can't beat 'em, eat 'em
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/09/cray_eats_appro/

Cray is going to top off a pretty good year financially if it can get
the many-petaflopping Titan and Blue Waters supercomputers accepted at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Illinois.

There's a good chance those machines will be accepted, but it creates a
problem: the $188m Blue Waters deal was an unexpected win, and next
year, the company will be facing down a very tough compare. Moreover,
Cray doesn't really have a plain vanilla x86 cluster business, and
particular does not have one that is suited for helping it build Hadoop
and other big data iron.

attention has shifted to the upcoming Student Cluster Competition
(SCC), which will kick off next Monday at SC12 in Salt Lake City.

The traditional =E2=80=98Big Iron=E2=80=99 competition (details here) has t=
eams of
undergraduates benchmarking their home-grown clusters to see which
school is best at wringing the most HPC app performance (LINK2) out of

Hot on the heels of the delivery of the 20-plus petaflops "Titan"
CPU-GPU hybrid supercomputer to Oak Ridge National Laboratory last
week, Cray has launched what is unquestionably a much better machine,
the long-awaited "Cascade" system developed in conjunction with the US
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and sporting the new "Aries"

Scraggly student veterans bid for SC12 victory
Does experience =3D cluster triumph?
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/06/sc12_cluster_competition_4/

A couple of old-timer teams round out the field at the upcoming SC12
Student Cluster Competition (SCC) in Salt Lake City. These contests
started in 2007 and between them, these two teams have participated in
a total of nine matches.

Each school has six team members plus three advisors/coaches. Let=E2=80=99s
assume that the competition consumes six hours per week (it=E2=80=99s proba=
bly
more) for six months: conservatively, students and faculty at these two
schools have invested more than 25,000 hours in designing, building,
testing, and ultimately competing against other teams with their
clusters. That=E2=80=99s 631 weeks of a 40-hour-per-week job, or more than =
12
years of real-world working life. (This assumes a typical US or Asian
50-week work year. Europeans should adjust to correct for longer
vacations, holidays, =E2=80=98sick=E2=80=99 day allowances, work stoppages,=
 etc.)

China tries for 2012 WORLD cluster compo DOMINATION
Sends NUDT, UTSC against the world at SC12 cluster-fest
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/06/sc12_cluster_competition_2/

According to Chinese astrologers, 2012 is the Year of the Dragon, and
it=E2=80=99s certainly been a most auspicious year for Chinese HPC student
cluster teams. So far this year*, China has completely dominated the
Student Cluster Competition circuit.

China's Tsinghua and NUDT university teams took both the Overall and
highest LINPACK awards at ISC=E2=80=9912 in Hamburg. With wins at the upcom=
ing
competition at SC12 in Salt Lake City, the teams have a solid chance to
finish out the 2012 season undefeated. This hasn=E2=80=99t happened since...
well, never. Up until 2012, the only student cluster competitions were
held at the annual US-based SC conference. With the addition of a
cluster competition at the European ISC shows, we now have a
full-fledged circuit, right?

Two Texan teams tool up, ride out to enormo cluster shootout
We're gonna kick supercomputer ass and chew gum - and we're all out of
gum
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/06/sc12_cluster_competition_texas/

People in most US states would be ecstatic (or, perhaps, totally
indifferent) to hear that one of their universities made it to the 2012
Student Cluster Competition (SCC) in Salt Lake City, but the state of
Texas wanted more - so it's sending two teams to the Great Salt Lake
Siege.

Details on cluster-building competition rules, applications and prizes
are here and here. (I say prizes, there aren't really any but it's the
taking part that counts.) Go ahead and read those articles if you
haven't already; I=E2=80=99ll pause here until you catch up.

Swiss boffins slap together homegrown zBox4 supercomputer
Overnighter yields 54 teraflops with flashy storage
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/06/zurich_zbox4_supercomputer/

Students and a few wandering professors at the Institute for
Theoretical Physics at the University of Zurich had a perfect weekend
when they scraped together the funds to buy the parts for their zBox4
homegrown supercomputer and assembled the two-rack beast.

This is the fourth generation of homegrown machines that the ITP
students have put together, and it represents a serious upgrade over
the zBox3 system it replaces, including a new "platter" design where
the motherboards and storage are mounted as well as new custom shelving
that looks a tad bit like baker's shelves such as those made famous by
Google in its early data centers.

The apps for this year=E2=80=99s edition of the SC12 Student Cluster
Competition are the typical mix of HPC workloads, chosen to represent a
range of scientific disciplines and computational challenges. In order
