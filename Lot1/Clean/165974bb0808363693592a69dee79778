Subject:[Flexradio] Waterfall memory for each band
Has anyone figured out how to save the High and Low Waterfall settings for
each band?

 

For example, when I switch from 10m down to 40m, I needs to re-adjust the
Waterfall so that the display is not saturated due to the higher signal
levels.

 

SDR should really remember the settings for both waterfall and panadaptor,
this would save a lot of time adjusting them each time a user changes band.

 

It seems like it should be an easy update if it's not already available.

 

 

Thanks,

Ray
