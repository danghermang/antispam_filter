Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Revealed: Amazing details of 'bar brawl' in ref
	Clattenburg's room at Chelsea [Mirror]
Yes, the guy outside would be CFC - what I meant was it wouldn't be
official word from anyone who knew whys & wherefores. Just saw running
and shouting really. The mention of the Mikel "monkey" insult and
"Spanish twats" on Sunday being a little closer, but nothing more.

I think a more sober view would be that link to the Times backpage, if
you can zoom in on that on an iPad. The story there seems very
different, with Mikel being asked if he was absolutely certain of the
words used and him insisting he did. If you can't view it, the passage
is:

~~~~~
Chelsea are backing Mikel's claims having made a formal complaint to the
Premier League about Clattenburg's "inappropriate language", a move that
followed almost two hours of animated discussions among players,
backroom staff and club officials in the dressing room at Stamford
Bridge.

It is understood that several senior players initially felt
uncomfortable about the club making such a serious allegation,
repeatedly asking Mikel if he was sure that Clattenburg had used the
word he thought he had heard, and even questioning whether their
team-mate could understand the referee's Durham accent.

Mikel's conviction and the strength of feeling among his team-mates won
the day, however, leading Chelsea to conclude that they had no choice
but to make a formal complaint. Clattenburg is determined to clear his
name but has been stood down from this weekend's Premier League matches
~~~~~

In the face of that, it would almost be worse if the club didn't follow
up Mikel's complaint. The recent issues have been that black players (or
even children subject to abuse in the Savile case) aren't believed or
supported in making complaints against authority figures. However, I
fully accept that proving it against 4 officials wired together all
saying the same thing will be nigh on impossible. I can't see how this
will end well.
