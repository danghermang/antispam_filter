Subject:[OzFurry] looking for a midfur roommate
Hi fluffs!

 

I've been dangling my tail for weeks, waiting to see if my boyfriend was
coming to midfur and as a result, haven't actually arranged accommodation,
so I'm wondering if anyone wants to split a room at a hotel near midfur?
Just email me back offlist, and hurry!
