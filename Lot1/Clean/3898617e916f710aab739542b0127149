Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ordinary run of the mill dipole
Richard,

We all agree that the self-resonant center-fed dipole is a bit shorter in 
length than lambda/2.

However, the value of the radiation resistance at resonance depends on the 
ratio of the diameter to the length of the conductors of the arm (as does 
the exact length of the arms at resonance).  Rrad is always less than 73 
Ohms, but 65 Ohms is only a special case -- for a rather "fat" conductor at 
that.   The "thinner" the conductor, the higher the radiation resistance at 
resonance.....

Quoting from John Kraus' ANTENNAS..., 3rd Edition, page 182 with respect to
his calculation of 73 +j 42.5 ohms shown there for the (free space) terminal
impedance of a thin, linear, center-fed, 1/2WL dipole, he goes on to state:

"To make the reactance zero, that is, to make the antenna resonant, requires
that the antenna be shortened a few percent less than 1/2WL.  This
shortening also results in a reduction in the value of radiation resistance
to about 65 ohms."
