Subject:Request for update of linux-image-3.2.0-0.bpo.3-amd64 to 3.2.33
Would be nice if this was updated to 3.2.33, especially since lower version=
s make it almost impossible to properly run a production nfs4 server.

    nfsd4: fix nfs4 stateid leak

    commit cf9182e90b2af04245ac4fae497fe73fc71285b4 upstream.

    Processes that open and close multiple files may end up setting this
    oo_last_closed_stid without freeing what was previously pointed to.
    This can result in a major leak, visible for example by watching the
    nfsd4_stateids line of /proc/slabinfo.


Regards,

Taylan
