Subject:Re: [child_lit] 60+ children's books featuring museum artefacts on
 public display around the world
Hi Zoe,

That's a great list - you've really 'added value' to the suggestions with
your own research. Seeing it inevitably jogged my memory (again...). You
reminded me that Susan Cooper's *Over Sea, Under Stone* finishes with a
scene in The British Museum, when they present the Trewissick Grail to a
grateful world. The Museum also features briefly at the beginning of *
Greenwitch*, when they return after it's been stolen.

Best wishes,

Cathy
