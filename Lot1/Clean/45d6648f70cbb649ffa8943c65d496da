Hi Sara,

It depends whether you are happy to have a sim on the mainland in Second
Life or want a private sim which gives the appearance of an island in the
middle of the ocean. 

This link identifies costs for undeveloped land:
http://secondlife.com/land/privatepricing.php?lang=en-US . This is assuming
you are looking at Second Life.  However there are other sims in OpenSim you
may wish to explore e.g. JokaydiaGRID charges $25 per month per island sim.
The Kitely grid is another grid worth exploring. But you really need to
weigh up the pros and cons of the grids.  Second Life is certainly the most
stable grid I have come across and your students can visit other sims too,
perhaps saving you some work.  Then you can focus on developing your unique
designs.

Hope this helps.

Kind Regards,
Anne

How much does owning land that could be used for nursing simulation cost? I
want to try to pursue this idea. 

Thanks!
