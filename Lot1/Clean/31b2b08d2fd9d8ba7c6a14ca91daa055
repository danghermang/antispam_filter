Subject:Re: [anti-abuse-wg] abuse-c implementation schedule
Hello Bengt,

As announced before in this thread -as in the text you have quoted-, our =
plan will be announced by mid november. Our planning work is actually =
done and we are running it through all involved departments to be sure =
all involved parties can commit to the dates stated in the plan.

The final announcement along with the detailed explanation and our =
proposed time line will be published in three days.

Kind Regards,
Kaveh Ranjbar,
