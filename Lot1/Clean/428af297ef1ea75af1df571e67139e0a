Subject:Re: [child_lit] NY Times Review of J.K. Rowling's new book
I read it and enjoyed it (and am probably in the minority as far as the rev=
iews are concerned). It helped me to forget who the author was and just get=
 immersed in the story for its own sake. Personally, I enjoy novels about s=
mall English towns and have read several, so that probably helped with my e=
njoyment of the book.

It's very, very dark and there are an incredible number of characters (I ac=
tually had to take notes at first) but eventually I got to know everyone. I=
 enjoyed seeing different perspectives of the same characters and events fr=
om multiple points of view... for example, a mother comments that she's hap=
py with a suit she bought her teenage son, while a friend of the son mentio=
ns how cheap the suit looks. =



I read a review (slight spoiler ahead) that mentioned that the novel starte=
d with a death and ended with two funerals. The death is no surprise... it =
happens on the third page and is the focus of the early part of the novel. =
But there was a moment about 50 pages from the end where there were six peo=
ple whose funerals the book could have ended with... and Rowling had me at =
the edge of my seat. To me, that was the best part of the book.=A0

I'd love to hear other opinions from those who have read it, but hope we ca=
n steer clear from the inevitable Harry Potter comparisons the reviews were=
 full of. =
