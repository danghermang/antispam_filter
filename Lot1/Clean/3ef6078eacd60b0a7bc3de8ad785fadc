Subject:Re: [CT Birds] Speaking of Cormorants
And also speaking of DC Cormorants, I did an abrupt stop the other day at a
bird in Gould Manor Pond over by Home Depot in Fairfield.  I double checked
all the bird books I schlep around with me in the car.  It was the first
time I've seen a Hatch Year DC Cormorant - or at least one so close up for
good viewing.  Quite different looking plumage from the adult but also
quite striking.
