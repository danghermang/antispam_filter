Thanks, Wanda! I was lucky in that the outfit matches itself: scarf,  
tunic & skirt, which is amazing since it is long enough for me, and I  
am tall.

I have a choli cut out to go with lovely sari that came unaccompanied,  
but have not made it. I took the pattern from a thrift store find  
which (again, amazingly) fit my actual bust, even though it was worn  
out and barely usable when found.

I found my first sari in the "curtain" department of the thrift store.  
They soon learned better!
