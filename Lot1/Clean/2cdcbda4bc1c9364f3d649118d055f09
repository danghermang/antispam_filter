Let me see if I understand the above in my terms -  I have a discharger, it
is a 300wt lamp, I start discharging at' StDisChrgV' (voltage at start of
Discharge) and end discharging at 'EndDisChgV' (voltage at end of Discharge)
and I know the 'DisChgT' (Discharge Time). The discharge stops because
'SlopeDifMax' has been reached (voltage sampling has determined that the
rate or slope of discharge is too fast and a weak cell reversal may occur or
the voltage is dropping abnormally fast).

pack/battery?
