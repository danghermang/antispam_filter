Subject:[Flexradio] What has happen to tech support
I submitted a support request on the 14th and I have gotten only one
response from Flexradio shortly after I submitted it.

I am 99% sure it is a hardware problem, because my external mic plugged
into the Flex3000 just stop working and hasn't worked since.

Is the people at Flex OK?  I hope Dudley isn't ill or had other emergency.

thanks and 73
