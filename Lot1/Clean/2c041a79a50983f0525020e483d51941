I am intrigued by the question as well but one thing that comes to mind, in=
 terms of contemporary kids, is to think about the impact of inter-textual =
influences.

Growing up in Toronto, Canada in the 60s in a upperly middle-class reading =
environment meant that I was exposed to British children's fiction in a way=
 that my American contemporaries might not have been - a steady diet of Eni=
d Blyton's Famous Five and the Adventure series, Mary Norton's Bedknobs and=
 Broomsticks and Monica Dickens' horsie books (ah the joys of Follyfoot!) -=
 I remember finishing the Dr Dolittle books and being introduced to books l=
ike Homer Price and the Freddy books for the first time at my local library=
. Those British children's books might have found their way into my life be=
cause of my place in the world at that time.So I agree with your pal, Hal, =
that it's likely that race and class and gender played a more formidable ro=
le in reading experiences in the past.

But if I go by the reading experiences of my very very diverse 1st year cla=
ssroom at York University now, while they might be reading Where the Wild T=
hings Are for the very first time, they have ALL read Harry Potter, Twillig=
ht and the Hunger Games. Is this because their access to the texts no longe=
r depends on who introduces them to books? Have the plethora of feature fil=
ms shaken the barriers and made these kinds of texts more accessible? Going=
 by my own personal experiences with my two mixed race godsons, they are al=
so reading the same things as their hugely diverse and racially mixed group=
 of friends are reading. So I'd be interested in knowing if films like The =
Hobbit and Narnia are changing up the perhaps more class/race/cultural read=
ing habits of the past?

What an excellent question.

I must admit that even in my all-most-White (by nature of it being a VERY
small rural town in BC) high school, only a subset of students read _Lord
of the Rings_. We all knew _The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe_, because
it was assigned reading in Grade 5 and we HATED it. Once I read the series
and DIDN'T have to answer all those STUPID questions (this the attitude of
my 10-year-old self), I loved them. But exposure to these "classics" came
from parents and older geeky siblings, and was thus restricted--in my
personal situation--to the geeks of the school. I would say that made us
about the 5-10%. African-Canadian was not an issue, as there were NONE in
my school. Our town had 2 families of Japanese, and 2 families of Indians.
All else were White, but not everyone was as lucky as me to be a real geek.
