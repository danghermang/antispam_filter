Subject:[burners] Jewelry of Burning Man
Hi Everyone,

I am working on a large pictorial coffee book called "The Jewelry of Burning Man."  Chapters will include, gifting, gifted, wearing, and the stories surrounding the journey.  I am looking for anybody who either received jewelry, gifted  jewelry and any amazing story that involved a piece of jewelry.   

The book will be about 125 original photographs, spanned over Firefly, PDF, DeComp and Burning Man.  After working on the pendant project for so many years, which in itself has lots of incredible stories around it, I want to expand on other stories that you all have. I will be heading out to SF in February and photograph the aRtery archive.  

The plan also involves a website for video stories, more pictures and a Kickstarter for the book.  Any technical assistance in helping that come about would be greatly appreciated.  I do have a small budget for your time and effort.

Please contact me offline if you have a story to share or a precious piece of jewelry that you would like me to photograph. 

Yay.
