Subject:Re: [MG] Common business entity model
Marc and George,

Thanks Marc, I have a rough understanding of the model now.  If any
other English speakers have questions about it, then I'll try to
answer them.  Sometimes explaining is the best way to learn.  ;^)

Or maybe an open diamond symbol (aggregate).  I think filled diamond
(composite) implies a single group.

Welcome George,

http://www.imc.com.gr/ontologies/eDialogos/consensus/img/class_diagram_v0.1.png
I was looking at the core relations (eDialogos below).  I think I can
map them to the terminology we use (in Outcast) and also AG Meinungs-
findungstool (CBEM/AG):


                  has                has
  IdeaContest  <-------  Idea  ----------->  User          (eDialogos)

         Poll  <-------  Position  ------->  Person        (Outcast)

        Topic  <-------  Opinion  -------->  Participant   (CBEM/AG)


Maybe this can be our Rosetta stone for the rest of the world. :-)
