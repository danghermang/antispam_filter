Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Kirk

You are right, perhaps you had better stick to your branch of physics
. . :)  You clearly have little interest in 'difficult' areas of
antenna engineering when the going gets tough :)

It's a fact that ferrite rod antennas are confined to a very few
specialised applications, and on here we understand why.

It's perfectly consistent with the physics - you just have to make an
effort to understand it, and if you are not interested in details like
capture area and effective length (which don't take much effort to
understand) don't keep on arguing and misleading people :).
