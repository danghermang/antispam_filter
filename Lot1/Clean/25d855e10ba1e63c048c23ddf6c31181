Subject:[child_lit] nuptial congratulations
Dear friends, 

For this once, I'd like to momentarily suspend the child_lit canon of adhering to children's literature in our discussions to send felicitations to child_lit mainstay and author of "Ritchie's Picks," Ritchie Parkington, on his recent nuptials. Warm regards, Ritchie, and best of luck to you! 


Best, 
Michael
