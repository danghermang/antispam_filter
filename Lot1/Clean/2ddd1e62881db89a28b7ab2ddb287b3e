Yep, that is the scenario that makes the most sense.

Christmas music is not the great seller that is was 20+ years ago.=A0 This =
city has become much more diverse racially/ethnically, then add the fact th=
at at least one major radio station will go 'all Christmas" beginning the F=
riday before thanksgiving and you can see the main reasons for the loss of =
interest.

The way it plays out: After an initial spurt of interest when the music is =
put in (50-75 titles) it goes down and picks up again a few days before Chr=
istmas.=A0=A0=20

Then in typical American style, right after the 25th, interest dies off alm=
ost completely and the music is essentially deadwood.

It's really a lot of work for little added return, but it adds to the fun o=
f the season.

Thomas, staff in my locations began to ask about when they'll get Christmas=
 music as soon as September began.

I gave them the same answer some have heard for over twenty years; "first c=
ollection after Thanksgiving".
