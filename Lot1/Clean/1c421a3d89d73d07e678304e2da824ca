I think there is another viable option;

*Allow IPv4 PI from the transfer market

But, I by my read of RIPE policy this isn't allow, or its not clear to 
me that it is allowed when I read the policy.  If, I'm wrong about this 
please correct me.

If the RIPE community doesn't want to make IPv4 PI assignments out of 
its last /8, I think that is defensible.  If someone wants something out 
of the last /8, making them become an LIR seems reasonable as well. 
However, saying there is no such thing as IPv4 PI any longer is not 
reasonable when there is a viable transfer market available as a source 
of addresses.

The whole point of creating a IPv4 transfer market was to encourage 
getting unused or underutilized IPv4 addresses in to the hands of those 
that need them.  End users need for IPv4 PI is just as important and 
valid of a use for IPv4 as ISP need for IPv4.  Shutting IPv4 PI out of 
the last /8 is one thing, shutting IPv4 PI out of the transfer market is 
another and doesn't seem justified.
