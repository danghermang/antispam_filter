Subject:[Chelsea] Ratings v Shakhtar
SHAKHTAR 2 CHELSEA 1
Well that put us in our place  it felt a little bit like Atletico with Falcao in the Super Cup  We were well beaten and the scoreline flatters us. 
The temptation is to say what we did wrong, but it's fair to say Shakhtar are a very good team full of invention and industry. They harried us and put our defence under big pressure. 
They ran out of steam before the end but now we must beat them at the Bridge and grab a draw in Turin if we are to move on. 

CECH, 7 -- Did his bit, but was left exposed too often. 
IVANOVICH, 7 -- Our best defender. Sealed his side and laud on our late goal for Oscar. 
LUIZ, 6 -- Less than convincing challenge for the first goal. Struggled to keep up with the movement of Shakhtar's forwards. 
TERRY, 6 -- His famed organizing abilities were nowhere in evidence in the first half where every Shakhtar corner was an adventure. 
COLE, 6 -- Had little protection as their right back rampaged down his side. Didn't do much going forward. 
MIKEL, 5 -- He and Ramires were unable to pick up attackers well enough and the back four was exposed too frequently. 
LAMPARD, 5 -- Injured early so not really fair to rate him. But he looked off the pace in the 10 minutes he lasted. 
RAMIRES, 5 -- Filled in for Lampard, but like Mikel didn't protect the back four. Made some typical forward runs without creating much. 
OSCAR, 6 -- Not able to stamp his authority on the game and loose in his defensive duties. Made some good long passes, but they were to Torres so ....Took his goal well. 
MATA, 7 -- Busy all night without ever breaking the game open. 
TORRES, 4 -- The word 'soft' comes to mind. Made some decent runs but the problem was when the ball was at his feet. He had no idea what to do with it and invariably lost it. 
Subs:
HAZARD (for Lampard, 11 mins), 5 -- Not sure what's wrong with him. Maybe we must expect that he'll disappear for much of a game and illuminate it with a few flashes of class like when he wriggled through in the second half and was stopped by the goalie. His corners were crap. 
STURRIDGE (for Torres, 70 mins), 6 --  Deserves a start in place of Torres. I almost crave his shoot on sight policy rather than Torres's dallying.
