Subject:[Flexradio] Remote bases
Hi All

I apologize for the slightly off topic post, but in searching Yahoo Groups,
I noticed that there was not an active group on the care and feeding of
using your radios in a remote base setting.

With that, I have created a group that can be used to discussion the
integration of Ham radios that you may want to operate remotely.

Group home page: http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/Ham_radio_remote_base
Group email address: Ham_radio_remote_base@yahoogroups.ca

If you are interested, I would enjoy having you join and collaborate with
others who are the same interests.
