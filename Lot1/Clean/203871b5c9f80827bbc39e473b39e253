I am looking to use the PI as a media centre and to power webcams and upload the pictures. I mention the laptop because I would like to install Linux on it but I actually cannot remember the name of the laptop and it isn't that close.

Not sure where you got the idea i was doing PI training,  I am running a
computer club for young people at Parkfield youth centre in Paignton,

 I did suggested the idea that perhaps we could put something together
in order to help people with for example computer secuity,  as that was
related to the thread.

Gordon knows far more about the Pi than I do.
