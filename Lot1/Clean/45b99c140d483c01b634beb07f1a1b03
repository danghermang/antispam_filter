That is true and an oversight on my part for which I take =

That was also an oversight and not intentional. Usually we indeed =

Does there need to be a *policy* on everything?=20

Look: we made a mistake with this one. It did not have any real =

I think we should be very conscious about when we invoke the policy =

formal policies are vital. However, invoking the policy process whenever =
