Subject:[child_lit] Children's books inspired by specific artefacts on
 public display in museums (any where in the world)?


It's probably been mentioned, but just in case there's Hudson Talbott's We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story, much of which is set in New York's American Museum of Natural History. The otherwise negligable film it spawned featured Julia Child's voice, in the role of Dr. Bleeb . 

I believe Ursula K. LeGuin's Rocannon's World opens in a museum on a far-off planet in the distant future...I'd characterize the book as crossover YA. 

I'm fairly certain there's a large, untapped pool of books that fit the search hovering in the back of my brain...I'm also afraid it's fascinating projects like this that keep me from finishing the pile of duller tasks I'm ignoring on my desk.
