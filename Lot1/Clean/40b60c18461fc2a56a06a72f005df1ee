Subject:[CT Birds] Wood Sandpiper, Raven and Leucistic Herring Gull
I spent most of the day (7:30 am to 2:30 pm) in Jamestown, Rhode  
Island with the Wood Sandpiper and had fantastic views both flying and  
feeding. The bird was close many times and one time at eight feet in  
front of me. I will have a complete report with many images in a few  
days on my blog.

But I just posted my latest report with good close-ups of a Raven and  
a leucistic Herring Gull I photographed last weekend. YOu can see the  
images here:

Hope you enjoy them!
