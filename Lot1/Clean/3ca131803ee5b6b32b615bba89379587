Subject:[CT Birds] A Question About Merlins
I was checking out Madison's Bauer Park for the first time and spotted a female merlin atop a tall conifer. I seem to be seeing merlins much more this decade than in the past. Weren't they once much more uncommon? Do annual bird counts show their sightings going up?
