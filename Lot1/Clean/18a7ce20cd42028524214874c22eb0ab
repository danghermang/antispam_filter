Subject:Re: [db-wg] [anti-abuse-wg] RIPE NCC's proposed implementation of
 Abuse Contact Management in the RIPE Database
Hi Kaveh, et.al,

I'm trying to figure out what I need to do to benefit from the abuse-c
initiative with minimal impact to our documentation and processes.

While rolling out IPv6 we (must) document the assignments.  This can (as
far as I known) either be done by a covering inet6num object with an
"assignment-size" and an internal documentation or by having an inet6num
object for every assignment.

With the later we can have an "abuse-mailbox" in a role object linking
to "tech-c" (and "admin-c") of the inet6num object.

So this is what we are doing today (create a role-object with
abuse-mailbox etc. per role/customer/participant and link to it from
admin-c and tech-c in the inet[6]num objects).

With this new schema we need to create an additional organisation object
just to link from the inet[6]num object (through "org" and the
organisation object) to the (already existing) role object.  In the
additional organisation object we copy the address and e-mail
information from the role object, because these two fields are mandatory
in both objects.  So we need to keep track of this information in two
objects.

Please see an example scheme here with the mandatory fields:

Did I miss something?  Can I do this easier?
Or is it mandatory/best practice to create an organisation object for
each customer/party anyway ?

If not, I would be happy to link directly from an "abuse-c" in the
inet[6]num object to the role account (in parallel to tech-c and admin-c).


Many thanks for help,
