I had a similar problem with a Seeburg R, and it turned out to be a
gummy bushing on the actuator of a leaf switch operated by the latch
bar.  It took a long time for the spring pressure to operate the switch.

Granted this was a different manufacturer and design, but it might be
worth looking into.  Make sure that the common switches operated by the
latch bar and selector keys are free to operate normally and are
properly adjusted.
