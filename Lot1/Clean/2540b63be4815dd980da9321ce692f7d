   Hello braun as Welcome to this Tech Resources update from The Register

   Enabling Datacenter and Cloud Service Management for Mid-Tier Enterprises
   http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9b0/5613a/50d/1abaaaf2?td=3Dm_wpe=
_h

      Companies rely on the data center and IT to provide mission-critical
      services, like e-mail, Web, and voice. However, assuring service
      delivery and reliability becomes increasingly difficult as growth in
      data center virtualization, remote access, cloud-based applications,
      and outsourced service technologies fuel operational complexity.

      To improve service reliability, organizations must be able to see and
      manage all aspects of performance, availability, and security related
      to that service.

      Read this white paper to learn how the combination of discovery, data
      aggregation, correlation, out-of-the-box analytics, data management,
      and reporting can yield a single pane of glass into data center and IT
      operations and services.

A private Cloud-based approach

   Integrity Technology Systems (Integrity) is a consulting firm that
   offers a variety of information security, IT risk management and
   compliance services in the financial services, technology and
   manufacturing industries. These services include security penetration
   testing, disaster recovery, audit and control review, audit liaison,
   and policy and security architecture reviews.

   Dave Nelson, President of Integrity, sought to improve service
   offerings for his clients and expand into new markets. He wanted to
   provide a Software-as-a-Service model to his clients that would collect
   their event logs and analyze it in a remote environment so that the
   clients wouldn't have to hire and retain specialized individuals. By
   being the Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) for their clients,
   Integrity would be the security expert for those clients who didn't
   have the resources to do it themselves.

http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a52/5613a/50d/8ba5cd0a?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Microsoft and Hortonworks announced a strategic relationship earlier
   this year to accelerate and extend the delivery of Apache Hadoop-based
   distributions for Windows Server and Windows Azure.

   Join us in this 60-minute webcast with Rohit Bakashi, Product
   Management, Hortonworks and Mike Flasko, Program Manager, Microsoft to
   discuss the works being done since the announcement.

   In this session, we'll cover Hortonworks Data Platform and Microsoft's
   end-to-end roadmap for big data. Get a sneak demo of HDP on both
   Windows Server and Windows Azure and hear real-world use cases on how
   you can leverage Microsoft Big Data solution to unlock business
   insights from all your structured and unstructured data.

Apache Hadoop Just Got Simpler
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a53/5613a/50d/101fdf6f?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Hortonworks recently unveiled the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP),
   which is 100% open source data management software powered by Apache
   Hadoop. HDP makes Hadoop easier to install, integrate, manage and use
   for enterprises and solution providers.

   Join us for this webinar as we outline and demo the key features of the
   Hortonworks Data Platform, including:

   Rapid Installation thanks to a wizard that makes it easy to install and
   provision Hadoop across clusters of machines.

   Data Integration Services including Talend Open Studio for Big Data, a
   visual development environment that allows you to connect to hundreds
   of data sources without writing code.

   Management and Monitoring Services including Hortonworks Management
   Center, which is an open source and extensible tool that provides
   intuitive web-based dashboards for monitoring your clusters and
   creating alerts.

   Centralized Metadata Services, including HCatalog, which greatly
   simplifies data sharing between Hadoop and other enterprise data
   systems.

   Don't miss this opportunity to hear about Hortonworks Data Platform
   from the team that created it.
