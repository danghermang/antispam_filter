I'm not sure if I find this "simple", to be honest.

Being able to specify an abuse-c: in the ASSIGNED inet(6)num: object, 
and having the RIPE DB software honour that on queries - that is: not 
go to the allocation's org->abuse-c - would require less objects to be 
created, and thus, less effort and less opportunity for confusion.
