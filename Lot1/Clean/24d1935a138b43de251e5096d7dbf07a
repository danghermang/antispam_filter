Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ordinary run of the mill dipole
With this one the wire OD = 100mm


                       EZNEC+ ver. 5.0

20m Dipole in Free Space                     11/8/2012 11:52:57 PM

          --------------- SOURCE DATA ---------------

Frequency = 14.16 MHz

Source 1      Voltage = 71.87 V at 0.0 deg.
               Current = 1 A at 0.0 deg.
               Impedance = 71.87 + J 0.0001724 ohms
               Power = 71.87 watts
               SWR (50 ohm system) =  1.437  (74.76 ohm system) = 1.040


Wire OD = 100mm
  Total overall length of dipole is 9.9017m
