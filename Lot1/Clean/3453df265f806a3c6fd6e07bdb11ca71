You call anyone who disagrees with you a pseudo-scientist? Anthropogenic Gl=
obal Warming is pseudo-science. It has not been proven,=A0yet you ridicule =
anyone who dares to challenge it. When someone disagrees with AGW, you thro=
w in their face all the arguments for climate change. Climate change is not=
 the issue; greenhouse gases being the cause is. You know the climate has c=
hanged many times before. Yet you continue to ignore the obvious cause: the=
 sun. Pseudo-science is articles such as comparing the sun-spot cycle to pa=
st ones and concluding greenhouse gases must be the cause, with no supporti=
ng evidence other than computer models, which will show whatever you want t=
hem to. The IPCC, in considering the evidence, concludes the solar imput si=
nce 1750 has not changed significantly to explain the present climate chang=
e, but greenhouse gases have risen, ergo that must be the cause. During tha=
t same period, the third lobe of the Little Ice Age proceeded, ca.
 1775, and sea level DROPPED until the nineteenth century started, glaciers=
 readvanced globally, and the only explanation is the sun. We may not fully=
 understand the sun, but to rule it out as the cause of the present climate=
 change is real pseudo-science.
