Subject:[Flexradio] Diversity reception - Noise cancellation
Is it possible to receive the same frequency on the two receivers in my 
5000a and invert one and then add it to the non-inverted and output
the result with a large degree of noise cancellation. I would think that 
the received noise would  be on a receiver using a less sensitive 
antenna in order to give inteference a slightly lower amplitude since it 
would not be necessary to cancel it completely, necessarily. I guess 
this would work in a manner similar to the MFJ 1026.

I looked in the KB but didn't find anything about this type of use of 
diversity reception with two receivers - or it was right in front of me 
and I was too dumb to see it.
