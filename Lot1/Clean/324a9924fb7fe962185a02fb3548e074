Subject:Re: [Chelsea] We're not backing ourselves
I thought this too - hat-trick - though to be fair I also had no
problem with Ramires staying at right-back, Mikel as a single DM as
he's played before and just switching Sturridge for Torres.

Have to say I was very surprised Oscar went off first followed by Mata
then Hazard. I'd have done it in exactly the reverse order, though
with Torres before any of them (ideally pre-match)
