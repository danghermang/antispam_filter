Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Weird BPSK31 Behavior
Sorry to QRM the group with my emails on this problem.

Think I stumbled on the issue - seems the PSDR Transmit Filter was set to
high=3100, low=200.  I changed it to 2100 and 200 and again have a clean
signal.

Really not sure what it was before the problem occurred, so would still
appreciate hearing from the experts as to whether I need to redo something
in the master PSDR database or something.

Subject: [Flexradio] Weird BPSK31 Behavior

I am suddenly experiencing a new problem with my Flex 3000 on PSK.
Everything has been nominal until this morning.  Now, instead of a nice
clean transmit signal on the screen, I have what appear to be two main
spikes.  One is the intended frequency and normal strength.  The second is
considerably lower in strength (40 or more db) and shifted about 1 KHz up in
frequency.

The only things that changed are:
1.  An unexpected and unexplained Windows shutdown and restart (Win 7 64 pro
on a late model i7 machine).  I know PSDR is not supposed to be shut down in
that manner and wonder if something fouled up there?

2. Last night I installed and used SDR Memory.  That seemed to work fine.

Appreciate any help/inputs.
