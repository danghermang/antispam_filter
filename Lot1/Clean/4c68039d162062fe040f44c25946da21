From Alex Burdo
11/11 - Fairfield, Pine Creek -- 1 YELLOW-BELLIED SAPSUCKER, 1 RED-BREASTED
NUTHATCH, 3 WINTER WREN, 1 ORANGE-CROWNED WARBLER, 1 LINCOLN'S SPARROW, 1

Blackpoll Warbler (4 warbler species)
Fairfield, Metro Conservation Area -- 1 SNOW BUNTING, 1 VESPER SPARROW, 1

(hypochrysea), 1 Common Yellowthroat.
Fairfield, Fairfield University -- 7 WHITE-WINGED CROSSBILL, 1 RED-BREASTED
NUTHATCH, 5 Wild Turkey.

The Fairfield U crossbills were in the evergreens between Fitzgerald Way
and Bellarmine Road, next to the Bellarmine Museum of Art. This spot was
specifically chosen for its crossbill potential. I was standing along
Fitzgerald Way when I first heard vocalizations, and then watched as 7
WHITE-WINGED CROSSBILLS flew out of the top of a spruce and headed west,
calling. Not much for looks, but I'll take it!
