Subject:Re: [child_lit] Request for titles-loss, grieving, resilience
I don't think that "The Naming of Tishkin Silk" has been mentioned. A baby
who died without being named, and his sister's grieving and desire for a
name, on the one year anniversary. Glenda Millard is a splendid writer - and
you'll love her Silk family - very eccentric and delightful. There are about
five in the series now - this was the first. Virginia

Other books about remembering that might be useful as part of the grief
process are:  The Hundred Penny Box, by Sharon Bell Mathis, and The
Remembering Box, by Eth Clifford.  =


Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, is good for
encouraging discussion about anger/frustration and other emotions.  Also,
Michael Rosen's Sad Book.
