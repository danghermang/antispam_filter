astic earbuds, you've probably had the same gripes that I've had with 'em. =
Yeah, they're lightweight but the trouble is your ear has to be just the ri=
ght size to fit them. You have to jam them in your ear - hoping and praying=
 that they stay. But they always end up falling out... so you have to jam '=
em so far into your ear that they're REALLY uncomfortable. <img align=3D"ri=

"red"><em><strong>STEREO, have EXTRA BASS & are NOISE REDUCTION! </strong><=
/em></font><em>)</em> and are VERY comfortable.<br />
		<br />
		Let's face it, if earphones aren't comfortable, who <em>cares</em> how th=
ey sound, cuz you'll never wear 'em to ever find out! Well, these stream-li=
ned earphones really deliver not only on great sound but comfort too!<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Here's why these Stereo Earbuds work:</strong><br />
		<br />
		Each earpiece features a <font color=3D"blue"><strong><em>soft silicone e=
arpad</em></strong></font> and they will fit in almost any ear. They create=
 a slight suction - so when you place the earpiece in your ear it stays the=
re ...comfortably, and doesn't fall out!<br />
		<br />
		<font color=3D"#ff0000"><strong><em>These truly are a have a great set of=
 earphones that you can take where ever you go!</em></strong></font> In fac=
t, you can use these at your computer desk if you're working on your comput=
er late at night or early in the morning and you need to keep the sound dow=
n.<br />
		<br />
		And the cord is long enough (4 foot) without being too long so as to get =
tangled and in the way (another small point but something I've noticed as a=
 problem with other earphones I've tried!)<br />
		<br />
		And in case you were wonderin', this is the common plug (3.5 mm) that fit=
s into the front and your computer and most other audio devices, like porta=
ble radios, laptops, cd /dvd/mp3 players, iPods etc.<br />
