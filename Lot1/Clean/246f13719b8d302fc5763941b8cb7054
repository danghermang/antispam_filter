Wonderful wedding! Thanks for the invitation, Sarah and Kim.

I'll be on the Moomin Valley table please, and I'll have Snufkin and Little
My and the whole Moomin family (the Snork Maiden and Moominpapa would
undoubtedly be upset if they weren't invited. The Snork Maiden would be in
her element, regardless of the fact that I don't like her much...). I can't
ask all Jansson's characters - there are at least sixty. The table would be
far too large for intimate conversation, and I do want to ask Moominmamma
how she manages to be so unruffled and hospitable and accepting when facing
dramas of all kinds.  =


From outside Moominland, I'd ask Milne's Piglet. I think he could learn a
lot about independence, insouciance (and even irascibility) from Little My -
small doesn't have to be timid or self-effacing! =

Ok, everyone, you are now invited to a virtual wedding...Sarah style, pick
the ONE table you want to sit at. But I will let you cheat...you can choose
who sits at your table ...from that book, with one visitor from any other
book.

I want to sit with Meg Murray and her family, at their kitchen table and the
the Mrs. W's are included of course. And our visitor? Pippi might stir
things up. Or Catherine, called Birdy. Hmmmm. =
