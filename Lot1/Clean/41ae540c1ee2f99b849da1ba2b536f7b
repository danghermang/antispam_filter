Subject:[CT Birds] Sandy update
The barometric pressure in Sandy on the latest reading was 941 Mb (officially 946 as of 5 am, but will be lower at 8).   It appears that full phasing with the strong trough has occurred.  To put this into perspective, the minimum pressure of the Hurricane of 1938 was 938 and i believe it was 946 at landfall.  This extremely worrisome trend, and the track (to a lesser degree at this point) will have a huge impact on how bad this storm will be for CT and NYC.  If pressure continues to fall before landfall...if it gets into the 930's and if it come in anywhere north of Cape May, she is going to surprise everyone with her ferocity.    Stay safe everyone and don't even think of going into closed areas, even to look for birds.   Heck you probably won't need to go anywhere near the coast; you might just have gadfly petrels flying over your yard if you live in Salisbury!
