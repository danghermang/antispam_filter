Limited number of birds on very light north winds switching to southeast,  
but an interesting day, including another NORTHERN GOSHAWK
 
OS 12, BE 6, NH 2(1 gray ghost), SS 11, CH 24, AK 7, ML 3, PG 7, N.  
GOSHAWK 1, RS 1, RT 11, BW 6, TV 5, UR 1
97 Total
 
Passerine movement seemed to have lessened, only birds of note: many  
hundreds of Tree Swallows 300 Pine Siskins and 200 Blackbirds
 
We now have 198 Bald Eagles (our all time record, going up with every new  
bird) and 191 Peregrine Falcons. The PG record of 212 was set last year, and 
I  think we have a shot at it again.
