Oh crap, everything else aside, I've just realised I spelt your name
wrong - on a quick scan it's easy to transpose the "i" and "j".

Don't think I've ever seen it spelt like that before, apologies. Would I
be pushing it too far to extrapolate that if I had just been writing or
auditing secure code, instead of chatting with you on a mailing list, I
might have just introduced a critical bug?

Cheers
