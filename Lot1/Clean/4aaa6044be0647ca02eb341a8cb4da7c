Subject:Re: [EVDL] Battery Terminal Torque
Hello Bruce,

There is a torque rating chart for these types of batteries at EV Source. 
The torque depends on the bolt size too and temperature of the fastener.

Lets say the terminal connection is at 70 F when you first install it, 
running under load for about 5 miles, it is common to loose about 5 inch 
lbs.

You may have to re-torque the terminal again.  I had to re-torque my battery 
connections several times as the ambient temperature drops.
