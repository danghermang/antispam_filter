Subject:[Koha] RSS and SMS overdues cronjob
Hello.

As they currently stand, the cron jobs at misc/cronjobs/smsoverdues.pl and
misc/cronjobs/rss/rss.pl will not work on an out-of-the-box Koha
installation, as they require an obsolete templating system. I am wondering
if anyone still uses these cron jobs, or whether they are obsolete legacy
scripts that should just be removed at this point.

So, are you using either of these scripts? Do you know anyone else who does?

Regards,
Jared
