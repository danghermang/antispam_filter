Subject:Re: [h-cost] Umm. . . please say something historical?
Well, I DID say I was looking for a machine with the idea of doing 
historical embroidery that looked sort of accurate, and wondered if 
there were many available historical designs or if not, how to digitize 
my own.  Blackwork is a nice idea but I'm also interested in other kinds 
of embroidery.  I'm sure embroidery machines can do satin stitch, but 
can they do chain stitch?  What kinds of stitches comparable to hand 
stitches are available on embroidery machines, other than straight 
sewing, zigzag, satin stitch, and the kinds of seam finishes available 
on sewing machines like my Bernina 1008?

I'm not that impressed by the blackwork samples someone linked to, but I 
think they would have been improved by use of a heavier thread.  The 
real difficulty I saw was a machine-like regularity.

This list isn't very active, so let's not spoil a conversation by over 
policing.
