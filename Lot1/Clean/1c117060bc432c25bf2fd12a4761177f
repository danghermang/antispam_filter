Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] What bird #2

I see there were two posts for Bower's Shrike-thrush and two for Little Shrike-thrush.
Still wondering which thrush won ?

Subject: [Birding-Aus] What bird #2


Hi,

I was filming a pair of Shining Flycatchers up on Cape York, and this other 
plain brown bird was just hanging around, now is it a juvenile or something else 
?

I didn't see any feeding and then they all flew off.
