Subject:[CT Birds] RUFF in Rhode Island now
Looks like Rhode Island is being blessed with interesting Shorebirds lately.

The Wood Sandpiper is still present in Jamestown and a RUFF has just  
been reported and is visible in the marsh behind RI Country Club in  
Barrington  Take Tillinghast Road and park in the RISD dirt lot.  Head  
for the beach.  Once on the beach,  go right and walk to where there  
are views of the marsh.  The Ruff is feeding in the small pools and  
also flying around the area.  A scope is helpful.
