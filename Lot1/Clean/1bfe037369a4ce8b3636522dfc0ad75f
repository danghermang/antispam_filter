Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] 10 Falls this year - Can we set the 21st
 century record for recovered falls?
Apologies in advance for use of the dreaded "hammer fall" label in
relation to Carancas.  I know Mike and a few others despise that term.
 Not a true hammer stone like Guadalajara, but something manmade was
damaged during Carancas, so I make a distinction there, instead of
just saying Carancas is another fall.

Best regards,

MikeG
