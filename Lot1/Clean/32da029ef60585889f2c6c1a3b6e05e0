Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] Any New Novato Finds?
Hello Cal,

Sorry to hear about your mother.=A0 =

Good thing you visited her.=A0 =

Glad to hear that she will be OK. =


Would like to hear from you again, after your hunt. =

Any report, even if it is only about the =

effects of the recent storm, or =

the amount of fallen leaves in the streets, or =

the height of the new grass coming up in the field, or =

whether or not any rocks are left behind after the street-sweepers have don=
e their job?=A0 Might sound mundane, but still important.=A0 =

I'm tired of reading about Novato from people that haven't been there.=A0 =


Good luck searching in Novato.
There has been a small army searching this area.=A0 =

Yes, many are "novitiates", but there have also been quite a few =

high-profile hunters who have come with little fanfare, and =

have left with even less.=A0 =


What has shocked me is that none of the press in the town of Sonoma have be=
en approached.=A0 In my efforts to extend the news of this strewn-field acr=
oss the river and into that town,=A0I've been contacting editors of newspap=
ers there and have discovered that they were unaware that the meteorites th=
at fell in Novato could have also landed in Sonoma.  =


If just one resident in Sonoma were to report a meteorite (like Lisa Webber=
 did in Novato) it would really open up the strewn field.  =


Wait until after this weekend, Cal, then check the "websites" for =

news about Novato finds.

With best regards,
Bob V.
