It was a wild, beautiful, pre-storm day at Lighthouse.=A0 136 diurnal rapto=
rs total.=A0 The big hawks lingered overhead for quite a while, the passeri=
nes were stuffing their faces, and the Coops were trying to stuff their fac=
es as well. I guess I'll just transcribe the HMANA (hawk) report:

NE winds 2-4, gusts to 5, 100% dark, murky low, thick, stormy cumulus in an=
ticipation of frankenstorm Sandy.

OBS RAPTOR
Breakfast at Coopersville this am.  At least 5 "events".  CHs screaming a
 foot off the deck past my legs.  An adult male Coop in the very small =

Maple behind the site, awaiting an unwary small passerine, and then =

thrashing through the leaves/branches after it. =

Great looks at the swirling, lingering big birds. =

I left at least a ML, 2 RT, a CH and an OS in the Park (not counted). =
