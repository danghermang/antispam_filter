Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Hi all

Of course we will never make any progress if we get stuck on
redefining terms which we defined to everyone's satisfaction a few
weeks ago, I thought.  I share the frustration that we keep getting
diverted on to stupid meaningless arguments, which is why I am
spending more time on my other pursuits.

We have the resources here to reveal exactly how ferrite rod antennas
work, there is no mystery about it and they have been well understood
for several decades . . Alan Payne believes he has even found
improvements to the theory.

I am only too pleased to get on with the discussion but I have't got
the time to spend on continually arguing about minutiae.

Science is mainly about quantitative analysis, which means we have to
look at formulas and spend perhaps a little less time trying to tell a
story about what is happening.

So if anyone else wants to join the disussion, please come on in..
