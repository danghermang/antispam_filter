Subject:[CT Birds] RB Nuts, Pipits
From Charla & Steve Spector:
10 Nov 12, Milford.  In Trumbull Ave pines next to Milford Yacht Club, 3 Red-breasted Nuthatches (they were absent last year from this spot, a long-standing winter home of RB Nuts); at Silver Sands SP, Pipits (at least 40) continue in the park, with visitors greeted by 10 lined up atop the cyclone fence of the entrance road while a N. Harrier chased both Red-tailed and Red-Shouldered Hawks.
