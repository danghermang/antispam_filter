Subject:[Birding-Aus] Big Year record with Semi-P
Apologies for not putting this 'out there' yet.  Its been very hectic (but crazy fun)

But species #721 was Semipalmated plover at Simpson's Beach Broome on 28 October, which appears to be an Aussie Big Year record. This followed an amazing week on George Swan's Ashmore trip. I highly (highly) recommend it just read the trip report reported on this forum by Mike Carter!

Then off to Lord Howe Island for a nice slow-down, with Mrs and a few workmates.  WB Storm-petrel and LHI Woodhen were only ticks.  Highlight was meeting and spending some time with Andrew Silcox from Birdlife Aus. 

From Sydney airport last night I drove to Paynesville, and after a mini-panic, saw the way-faring Franklin's Gull at the 'gravel car park'.  That makes 724.  Will drive home now and tomorrow will try for Painted Snipe near home, then the Arctic Tern at Newie. I did update the blog a week ago, after the Semi P, and will try do get more images, including the Canadian interloper from Paynesville, in the coming days. www.birdingfordevils.com.au  .

Best wishes
