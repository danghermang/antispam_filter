One major trouble I am having is with the 505 field if I want to include an enhanced (as opposed to simply formatted) contents note to allow patrons to access chapters of edited volumes by title/author searches rather than just keywords. I am used to formatting them as a chain of $t /$r within a single field, but since Koha has separate form fields for each subfield, I feel a little out to sea on this one. Every variation I try makes the display unusable and doesn't visually connect the $t subfield to the appropriate $r subfield in the OPAC.

currently - probably yes (but, i haven't tested this)
