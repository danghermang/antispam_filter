Richard,

Exactly so.

But, Kraus did consider only a particular case, and did not purport to 
illustrate the range of possibilities as the ratio of length to diameter was 
varied.

So, he is correct in particular, but not in general.

It seems to me that the task of the "educated ham" is to understand more 
than just one particular case of an antenna, but rather the general range of 
antenna options.

John Kraus did not change the conductor OD in his textbook example for a
1/2WL, center-fed dipole when he stated that its (free space) radiation
resistance would drop from 73 ohms to ~ 65 ohms, when its end-end length was
reduced to achieve an input reactance of zero ohms -- i.e., first resonance.
