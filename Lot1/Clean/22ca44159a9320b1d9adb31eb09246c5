If CALB says their cells will decline to 2.6V when they are dead then I
would suggest setting the "minimum battery voltage at no current parameter"
a little higher than that to, say, 2.80V to 2.90V per cell, particularly if
your pack is top-balanced (or not balanced at all!?!).

The voltage the cells will sag down to under load has to be determined
empirically, unfortunately, since few (non?) of the cell manufacturers
provide discharge data above 1C. I would maybe start with 2.5V per cell and
go no lower than 2.0V per cell (unless you are a drag racer, in which case
the theoretical maximum power point for LFP cells occurs at a current draw
that results in the cell sagging down to 1.65V).
