Subject: Opportunity to Lead NOAA=92s Climate Program Office =96 Help Spread
the Word

Dear Colleagues,



We=92ve begun the process of filling the Climate Program Office (CPO)
Director position.  I encourage all qualified candidates to apply.  I also
hope you will help us spread the word to qualified candidates inside and
outside of NOAA.



To generate the broadest pool of qualified applicants, we are offering this
position through USAJOBS as either a Permanent Federal position at the
Senior Executive Service
level<https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/329856500>(US
Citizens only) or as a two-year Intergovernmental
Personnel Act (IPA)
assignment<https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/329857500>with
the possibility to extend for an additional two years (US citizens or
non-citizens who are permanent US residents and actively seeking
citizenship).  Additional information on IPA assignments is available on
the Office of Personnel Management
website<https://www.opm.gov/programs/ipa/assignf.asp>.
The job announcement is open through December 28, 2012.



Highly qualified candidates will demonstrate a combination of strong
scientific credentials and experience in leading large scientific programs
and in collaborating with diverse climate stakeholders.



As you know, the CPO Director is responsible for the development of climate
science, services, and information products for use by national, regional,
and local users both within and external to NOAA.  The Director allocates
and controls annually appropriated funds in order to maintain high quality
activities to meet society=92s climate needs. In addition, the Director
serves as a spokesperson for the NOAA Climate Program in meetings leading
to the identification of significant research projects and the
establishment of operational objectives, and the Director is the NOAA
principal representative to the interagency U.S. Global Change Research
Program.



Please direct questions about this position to Tim Ash (
Timothy.K.Ash@noaa.gov, 301-713-6304).



Thank you for your help spreading the word about this exciting leadership
opportunity.



Bob
