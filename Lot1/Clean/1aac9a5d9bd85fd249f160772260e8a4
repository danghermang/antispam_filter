Subject:[CT Birds] Sandy Point
I stopped by Sandy Point and the habitat looks like it will be amazing for nesting birds next season, but also a management headache because much of the best tern habitat is closer to heavy traffic areas..  Will post photos later on the Audubon Alliance Facebook page. 

There was a late White-rumped Sandpiper there and unfortunately a dead Rusty Blackbird.  And if there's one species that doesn't need increased mortality, it's RuBl.
