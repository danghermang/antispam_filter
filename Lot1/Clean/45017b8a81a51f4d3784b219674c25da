I see a kinda slow solution to this

1.  Not enough people are using linux or OSS due to lack of games or
rather mainstream games

2. Address this as per this thred and see if we can get people using
Linux based distros of some sort, even if they are using closed source
game engines,   get them on board and we can work on them to work on
open source game engines.

3.  Among the converted will be developers looking and asking questions,
so lets answer those questions by pointing people towards open standards
that will work across platforms etc, and devices

4.  Help and support the next generation of programmers in their
learning of open standards and help test / develop games or whatever is
needed (within reason)  hopefully we can then have programmers who think
as programmers not simply windows game developers but game developers

We have an opportunity,   we may have to change the way the lug works, 
we may hopefully end up with lots of younger members keen to learn,  
lets make sure we at least give them a good argument to use open standards.
