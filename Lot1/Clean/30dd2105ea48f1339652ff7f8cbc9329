Jerry,

Regardless of how you or anyone else feels, the rules for CTBirds are
quite clear.=A0 Posting the location of day-roosting owls, including
saw-whet and barred is FORBIDDEN.=A0 See the fourth point under A Few
Rules on the sign-up page

* Some birds should not be posted for the good of the bird. This
includes day-roosting owls - Eastern Screech, Great Horned, Barred,
Barn, Long-eared and Northern Saw-whet. It also includes nesting
birds, particularly directions to nests.

Anyone is free to debate the rule here on the list.=A0 Anyone who is
free to take it up with the COA board, and the board can change the
rules.=A0 In the meantime, do not post any more of what you posted
today.
