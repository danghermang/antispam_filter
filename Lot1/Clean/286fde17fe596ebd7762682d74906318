I'm curious, why is this phrase being added? It does not seem to be
discussed in the proposal summary or rationale. It also seems redundant,
given that section 1.1 Scope in ripe-553 already says =ABthis document
describes the policies for the responsible management of globally unique
IPv4 Internet address space in the RIPE NCC service region=BB.

It appears to me that the new paragraph being added (=ABother than for an
additional allocation, for the purpose of determining need, a period of
24 months is used in evaluating a transferred allocation=BB), is on it's
own sufficient to accomplish 2012-03's stated goal of increasing the
transfer-need-period to 24 month.
