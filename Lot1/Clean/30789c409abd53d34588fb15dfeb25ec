Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Capture Area
Alan

Thanks for that summary of the theory, especially the bit that says a
small antenna always captures the same power provided it is lossless.
As we have seen, it's a big proviso.

The open circuit voltage goes down with the radiation resistance as
the size is reduced, but for a lossless antenna they reduce at a rate
that means that the available power:

Pav = V^2/4Rr

remains constant, and equal to the capture area times the power
density of the incoming wave:

Pav = 3.lambda^2/8pi * E^2/zo

These equations can be combined to express the radiation resistance in
terms of the effective length Le for all small antennas:

Rr = 789 (Le/lambda)^2

and by introducing the equation for the open-circuit voltage of a
small loop the radiation resistance of a small lossless single-turn
loop can be derived:

Rr = 20.k^4.A^2.

A major point here is that 'available power' is a technical term from
circuit theory that ignores the losses, and it is not an expression of
the power available from a small antenna, because we know small
antennas are unavoidably lossy.

To find the actual power from the antenna is a piece of circuit theory
because the open-circuit voltage is in series with the radiation
resistance plus the reactance and the loss resistance, and it is not
difficult algebra to calculate the power in a load resistor.

For an antenna in which the major item is the reactance, the optimum
load resistor is equal to the reactance in ohms, while for a tuned
antenna the reactance is taken out and the optimum load resistor is
equal to the resistance of the antenna.  In very small antennas this
is equal to the loss resistance when the radiation resistance is much
smaller.

In practice I have found that it is difficult to predict the loss
resistance, but it is not difficult to predict the radiation
resistance and the reactance, so a Q-measurement can be used to
estimate the loss resistance quite accurately.

Capture area is variously defined by the formula 3.lambda^2/8pi, in
other words the capture area of the lossless antenna, which only
depends on the wavelength, or as the actual power output of the
antenna divided by the incident power density.  Naturally that can
cause confusion.

However to access this available power we must match to a smaller and smaller impedance, which might be measured in milli-ohms or less. This is too low an impedance for any practical matching circuit, and so with a small antenna there is always a very large mismatch loss. However we can reduce this loss by making the antenna larger, for instance by adding some ferrite, because this raises the radiation resistance and thereby reduces the mismatch loss. So the effect of the ferrite could be considered as a method of improving the match.

The ferrite is not unusual in this respect, the same thing will happen with a small dipole if we increase the length of its arms. Another way of saying that the available power is independent of antenna size is that the capture area is constant, and this is true of both the ferrite and the dipole.
> Kirk has asked the question why a loop is good for a crystal set but for a transistor radio a ferrite antenna is used. The answer is size. There are in fact many crystal sets with ferrite aerials, but if you want better performance use a loop. But to get the better performance the loop will have to be much bigger than the ferrite aerial, and thus too big for the radio.
