Subject:[Jukebox-list] RE: Seeburg 1950s DiNoc Cabinet Finish RestorationsVol
	111, no 19
I used the woodgraining.com kit on the Trashcan cabinet I restored this summer.

I think it worked out pretty nice but took a long time of trial & error to get 
the grain to blend satisfactorily. Straight grain is particularly tricky to get 
right. 


Here are pix of how it looks. Note that the metal pilaster trim, lower skirt, 
metal door frame and selection panel were NOT done using the ink & roller 
process.
I farmed those bits out to an outfit that does water transfer decals. The grain 
is not 100% correct with that water transfer process but I decided to complete 
the machine with those parts anyway.
The price of water transfer is rather dear so I wasn't about to strip it off for 
the sake of correctness. I mean, it doesn't look bad to the untrained eye. Rest 
assured I'll be using the ink & roller exclusively on my next 147M Trashcan.

So here are the pix with a bit of commentary:

When I was ordering the grain kit, I was sending Evan samples of Trashcan 
cabinets. He looked through his patterns and found one that they could not match 
to any automobile but matched perfectly to the Trashcan! It is called Avondire 
and is one of the ones used on certain Trashcan cabinets.

and sides of the cabinet.

Metal skirt is a water transfer grain pattern. Above it is the straight grain I 
applied with ink & roller.

The grain kit is a rather expensive thing to buy. I justified the cost because I 
intend to use it on at least four other jukes laying in wait.

Dinoc may have been used on some jukeboxes (it would be only on flat  surfaces 
and not compound curves) but the ones that I have seen were not  DiNoc or any 
other "film" type process. It was a basecoat - grain coat -  clear coat paint 
process which used engraved copper printing plates that  were made from 
photographs of real wood in which the ink was transfered from  the plate to the 
intended surface via a flexible rubberlike roller. I did  some pretty heavy duty 
research on this subject many years ago and I  developed, manufactured and sold 
a system that replicated the orginal sytem  which is a paint type system and not 
a film. I sold mainly to the old car  hobby. I used to do demonstrations at 
antique car shows in my area back in  the early 1990's. I've analyzed the 
woodgrain finish on jukeboxes and all  that i've looked at were the same 
process. I've done the woodgrain on a few  jukes myself... from Wurlitzer to 
Rockola. somewhere there is a rockola 1434  still around with the best exact 
original correct mahogany woodgrain that I  did in the early 1990's. Same with a 
1428 cabinet. The basecoat color on the  1428 was a light yellow!  I posted a 
lot of good information, including  links to the original patents on this 
process on this form a while back. I'm  sure it's still in the archives.  Danno
