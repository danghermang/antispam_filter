Subject:Re: [child_lit] New York TImes review of A Casual Vacancy
But when we note that these are the stylistic deficiencies of the Potter books, as some of us did during discussions on Child_Lit when the novels were new, why do we tend to excuse in children's literature what we won't tolerate in literature for adults? It cuts both ways if we are discussing the aesthetic qualities of the literature.

All of the examples given can just as easily be found in literature for adults.  It's a sign of bad writing (which was my complaint on Facebook about Rowling's new book, if any of you saw it) in either case.

Rowling did a wonderful job creating her world and characters for the Harry Potter books, but a stylesmith she is not.  I suspect the rather dark nature of this adult title without the delightful worldbuilding would cause those stylistic....er.. weaknesses stand out too much for me.
