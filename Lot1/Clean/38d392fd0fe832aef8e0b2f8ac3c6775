Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] incredible footage
I know it isn't real but it is fun to watch. However, if you ever get a
chance to see and hear a real mechanical nickelodean like some of the early
20th century Seeburgs
that is amazing to watch. Manufacturers at that time were geniuses in using
mechanical technology and could have several instruments actually playing
inside the machine using rollers like in player pianos. While computer
animation is amazing and fun too, there is nothing like the real McCoy...
Ditto for caliopies made for merry-go-rounds. Wurlitzer was the king of
that technology back in the day...
