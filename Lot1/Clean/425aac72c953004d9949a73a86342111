Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] "Mirrors" - Natatie Kills
LOL Sorry about that, should have written OT in subject line. I was working =

late into the night on 'The Black Phoenix' and was cranking up this tune as =

kind of a theme song. I meant to email it to someone in particular, but =

instead of just one person getting it, 1200 friends did!

I'll be a little more careful with my emails next time!

The artist's hair color was a nice black fusion crust color! ;-)

Best Regards,
Greg
