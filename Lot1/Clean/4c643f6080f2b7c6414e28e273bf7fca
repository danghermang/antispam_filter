Subject:Re: [EVDL] Cross Country EV?
Suppose you have:

(1) an EV with a reliable range of 120 miles at freeway speeds (60-65 mph)

(2) A battery that can be fast charged to 95% in 20 minutes (such as the
Toshiba battery
    in the electric Honda FIT which is now available on the West Coast for
lease, and which
    reportedly can be recharged to 95% in 18 minutes)

(3) High speed charging stations every 30-40 miles on the Interstates and
other major highways.

then you can travel 450+ miles almost as easily and quickly as with a gas
engine car.

Most people would make at least two 20+ minute stops for food, bathroom,
gas, or rest on a 450 mile trip and the trip would take about 8 hours; you
would need four 20+ minute stops in the EV and the trip would take 9 hours
(the first leg would be about 100 miles, and the subsequent legs about 95
miles each, for a theoretical 480 mile range with 20% of your battery left).

These are very near term goals, which I believe will be achived in 3-4
years.

Now you can still say that the gas engine car is more convenient; that is
for the 2-3% of trips more than 100 miles, but the EV is more convenient
for the 97-98% of trips less than 100 miles where you wake up every morning
with a fully charged car.

I believe that

(a) as soon as EVs are built from the ground up as EVs we will have that
120 mile range with batteries only 25% larger than those we have now, and
that if

(b), the initial cost is not too high it will almost be game over for ICE
cars, as the one moderate disadvantage of EVs for longer ranges, will be
more than offset by about a dozen advantages that EVs provide (economy of
operation, ease and convenience of operation, starting ability, liveliness
and fun, quietness, cleanness, smoothness, roominess, maintainability,
durability and long life, and safety)
