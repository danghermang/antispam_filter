Subject:[Flexradio] Receiver input protection
I am thinking about putting an old Heath SB-200 amplifier on either my 1000
or 3000. There has been a lot of discussion of keying issues so that's not a
problem. I have multiple flex radios, each connected to its own antenna.
Typically I would only have one turned on at a time, or be operating at qrp
power levels listening to multiple radio/antenna combinations for best
reception.

 

Operation at the 100 watt level has not caused any problems damaging front
ends but I am concerned what might happen running around 500 watts. Any
general rules of thumb on antenna spacing and front end protection for my
situation would be appreciated. Most of the high power operation would be on
75 meters.



I would also like to know how the front end bandpass filters are switched
when power is turned off, at least for the radios I have (1000, 1500, 3000).
I am hoping that latching relays are not used and when power is off I would
not have a problem with that radio! If that is the case I may be able to
just not turn on other radios when running high power on one. 



Thanks in advance!
