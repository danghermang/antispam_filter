While they may not be legally obliged to use Open source they are meant
to be accessible so we could simply ask them to consider OSS in the
future, 

Especially if we can back up the idea that MS are giving up on
silverlight, 

Perhaps if its Ok with Rick we can create an open letter to the
Ordinance survey on the exeter lug wiki,  work on it, between us,   then
e-mail the final result to them,  

Its worth a try,  

Paul
