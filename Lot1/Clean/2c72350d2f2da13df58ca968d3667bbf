Subject:Re: [EVDL] EVLN: Shalvi's Leaf powered frig,
	good for 3day power outages
I have heard of Prius'es being used for this as their pack
allows a decent amount of time between engine restarts to
make this feasible, but I think that doing this with an ICE
as "genset" will empty its fuel tank before the power comes back
so the EV wins in that perspective, unless you want to risk
running the inverter off the aux battery until it gets low
and start the ICE up before it dies and run the ICE until the 
aux battery is again more than 80% full, then shut the ICE off
repeat throughout the days and nights...

Unfortunately one could do the same thing with an ICE since all he did
is 
run an inverter off his 12v house battery.
The ICE would be left idling which would be very "dirty".
