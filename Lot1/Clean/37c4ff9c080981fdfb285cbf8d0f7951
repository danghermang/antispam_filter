Subject:[Koha] Simplest way to print labels?
I'm about to leave the Koha project I've been volunteering on, and I need t=
o find a better way of printing labels=85

What I have been doing is CSV export, then importing into LibreOffice (Open=
Office), and then formatting the sheet of labels every single time. But it'=
s too much work =97 the person who replaces me will never want to do that. =
The problem is that we automatically split our call numbers into 3 lines, s=
o the margins are not the standard ones.

Does anyone know a simpler way of exporting labels into a template or file =
that is pre-formatted in terms of fonts and margins? I am not against using=
 Word or some other commercial software.

Thanks,
Peter
