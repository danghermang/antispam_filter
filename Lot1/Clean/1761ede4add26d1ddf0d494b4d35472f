Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Vinyl record
Yes you can use the cookie cutter method with a 1.5 inch hole saw, but it's tricky. Heat the saw on the eye of your stove, center a large hole record above the small hole one, and push it through from both sides, melting the vinyl until you get a smooth edge.

I used to do this. Two potential pitfalls: 1. Getting the hole saw too hot where is melts away too much vinyl, giving you a hole too big. 2. Not precisely getting the hole centered.

If you value your records, a better solution is to simply get a small hole turntable for your juke. I'm not sure what the deal on AMI/Rowe machines are, but Rock-Ola jukes prior to 1978 had turntables that would change between small and large hole records like this one: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rockola-Turntable-for-a-Jukebox-/390318903301

You can easily remove the large hole turntable from newer Rock-Ola machines (Model 478 and later) and replace it with one like in the picture above.

While the later machines do not have the lift mech to automatically change between large and small hole records, you can still easily mix the two by simply leaving the large hole spindle in the down position and inserting 45 rpm inserts, (a/k/a "spiders") into your regular large hole records. Here is one link to the type inserts I use: http://www.ebay.com/itm/100-YELLOW-45-rpm-Record-Spindle-Adapters-Inserts-Spyders-NEW-/200689524440

I do this on two of my jukes and it works like a charm, allowing me to add much new music from the UK and some indy US labels that now make small hole 45s along with the old favorites.
