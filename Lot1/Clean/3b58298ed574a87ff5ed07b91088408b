Subject:Re: [Chelsea] No Mark: Marin tempted by return to former club
 Borussia Monchengladbach [Mirror]
A real shame if true.  I don't want us to have a reputation for buying
young players and then leaving them to rot in the stiffs.  It won't help us
attract young talent i the future.

I understand that RDM doesn't like him but an injury to one of our three
forward-line midfielders could see him with a chance to play.  That might
be the only way that he could persuade RDM to give him a chance.

Maybe he just won't be given that opportunity and from what little I've
seen of him, I would feel very disappointed if he was simply sent back to
Munich.
