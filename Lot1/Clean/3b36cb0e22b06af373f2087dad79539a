Subject:[child_lit] Hebrew book has been located!!
Thank you all!

I've located the book and it is still in print and someone is going to ship it to me from Israel and I am going to pay them in US dollars.

It's here if anyone is curious:

Of course I cannot read it myself. Bummer. But some kind person has done a search for me and found exactly what I was looking for!

(I wish I knew every language on the planet)!

The new power is not money in the hands of a few, but information in the hands of the many. - John Naisbitt, Megatrends

The Internet may be the world's greatest library, but let's face it - all the books are scattered on the floor.  - D.C. Denison, Boston Globe

Getting information off the Internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant. - Mitchell Kapor

To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction ... The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. - Martin Luther King, Jr. The Purpose of Education
