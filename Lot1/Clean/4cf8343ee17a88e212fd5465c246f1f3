On this page, it would appear that the phrase =ABWithin the RIPE NCC
service region,=BB is to be added at the beginning of the second paragrap=
h
in section 5.5.

However, that phrase is not found in the =ABnew text=BB box on this page.
That must be an omission?

As a general feedback to the draft document page, not specific to
2012-03, I find it preferable if the =ABoriginal text=BB and =ABnew text=BB
boxes are made as small as absolutely possible. If the paragraphs that
aren't touched by the proposal are kept outside of those boxes, it is
much easier to spot the actual changes made, than it is if you include
the entire original and new section side-by-side (as is the case with
2012-03's draft document).

Taking it one step further, it would be even better if those paragraphs
that have only change by a small amount (i.e., aren't completely
rewritten) have the actual changes highlighted, e.g., using
strikethrough for deleted text, and coloured text for added text (such
as the "Within the RIPE NCC service region" added by this proposal).

The changes indicated in sections 6.0 and 6.3 at
https://www.ripe.net/ripe/policies/proposals/2009-03/draft are two
examples I like.

In any case, I support this policy proposal.

Best regards,
