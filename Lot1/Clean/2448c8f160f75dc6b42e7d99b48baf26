Subject:Re: [bcp] Calling all Garmin 800 (or any other model) Users for Help
There have been some very large solar flares over the past couple of 
days.  While the GPS satellites should be hardened against their 
effects, it's possible that the civilian side of the satellites are less 
robust than the USAF side.  (Remember, GPS is built for and paid for by 
the US Air Force  [actually, by you and me through that part of our 
taxes that go to the USAF].  Civilians use a degraded, that is less 
accurate, signal than the military.)

I surmise it must have been a problem with the GPS connection -- perhaps the satellites were having a bad day.  From time to time, I have had the same issue with the automatic pause, when it tells me I am not moving, when of course I am.

I know that if you are out of satellite coverage it will ask if you want to discontinue searching and you can reply on the sensors.  However, how to do you do this when satellites are available, but just not working very well?
