Subject:[OzFurry] 28 Days To go!!!
28 Days Later...? HAVE THE FURZOMBIES ARRIVED YET!?

Yes, fur folk- It's only 28 Days to go until MiDFur 2012: Furry Apocalypse
Cometh!

What a hectic few weeks for the team. The MiDFur board have been on a
journey this year, creating and moulding the perfect apocalypse for all!
With the leadership of our cherished Cyn Wolfe, and the support of all our
MiDFur friends, we have carefully built, over the last 11 months- a
BUNKERLOAD of amazing stuff coming your way!

Just last week we had our on-site board meeting, and boy- it really
brought it home:

IT'S ALMOST HERE!! *running around like a psycho* THE END IS NIIGGHH!

*OK, just relax, it's not over yet!*

But...are you ready for it? Just in case you have some jitters, or are
feeling a little dazed- here's a pre-con survival guide for you, to make
the most of these pre-post-apocalyptic days:

Step 1: Assess the situation!
Are you planning on going to MiDFur? Well, have you registered? Uh-oh, you
haven't? Well , that's ok- you can register for MiDFur at

http://www.midfur.com.au/index.php/register1/

We even have brand new pre-register day-passes and a 3-day pass for the
Thurs-Sat, so you can customize your registration to fit your survival
needs!

Step 2: Seek out shelter!
A lounge is no place to be stranded with no place to stay, particularly
with ravenous, post-apocalypto furs about. While the Arrow is booked out,
the Space Hotel have a number of rooms at standard prices still available,
so check 'em out! There's also plenty of options in the Melbourne CBD to
suit a variety of budgets! But get in quick, guys- or you WILL miss out!

Step 3: FOOOD AND SUPPLIES!
This year we are SO THRILLED to announce that The Arrow on Swanston are
not only serving breakfast and lunch, but dinner too! No more wandering
aimlessly in search of value, budget meal options just as dark befalls the
wasteland!

Meals will start from $10 with some tasty tidbits for you to scavenge as
well. Meals and alcohol* can only be paid for in cash, but there's an ATM
next door!

We also have a Supplies Outpost in the way of a convenience store RIGHT
NEXT DOOR (how convenient is that?) They've been preparing for our arrival
come this end-time, so if you forget anything essential like deodorant or
sugary snacks, they'll be more than happy to help you.

(*alcohol will be served onsite from 5:30pm onwards)

Step 4: Familiarise Yourself with Your Surroundings!

The MiDFur 2012 Schedule App is up and running!
http://www.midfur.com.au/index.php/events

You can also check out the schedule on the link above.

Make sure you take note of pretty significant landmarks, like the Southern
Hemisphere's PREMIER of Bitter Lake, complete with POPCORN and BIG SCREEN
GOODNESS!

You could also learn from the experienced survivalists in the many panels
we have, our Furry Hall of Fame inductee this year is Steve Gallacci- this
guy STARTED conventions for furs. Not one to miss, because if anyone knows
how to survive a furry apocalypse, it has to be him. Be at the Furry Hall
of Fame induction, or any one of our amazing Guest of Honour panels.

Step 5: WARMTH

How will YOU clothe yourself in the apocalypse? This year the con lasts 5
Days, so prepare well. Luckily, MiDFur is happy to support your clothing
needs- check out :

BUT BE WARNED PRE-ORDERS CLOSE TODAY (5.11.12)AT 9:00pm EST!

If you're running out of ideas, or have some spectacular ones to share,
bring your stylish flair to the FASHION PARADE.
What's the vogue in rogue? The haute couture in catastrophic events?
Cosplayers- this one is definitely for you! (and all furs of fashionable
favour)

Anything to everything counts in the Fashion Parade to end ALL fashion
parades! Hot Music and some witty commentary to guide you as you model the
Revelations of all Fashion!
Sign-ups for the Fashion Parade will happen on the day,( and in the end
times even garbage-bags count as fashion)

Likewise DANCING is a form of warming up on cold, ice age nights (or
days). The Dance Fracas is run by the fursuit team, and open to all
(fursuit or not!). Stay tuned for more info on this shortly.

and finally-

Step 6: BE PREPARED FOR THE INEVITABLE

With only 28 Days to go till the beginning of the end, it pays to be
prepared. The most important thing is that you prepare for FUN!

We can't wait to see what exciting things are going to go down! But no
matter what, it's inevitable- The Last MiDFur on Earth (thankyou Mayans)
is GOING TO BE AWESOME!

THE END IS NIGH!

(so get ready to rubble!)

28 Days to Go!

*stockpiling cans of creamed corn*

See you there!
