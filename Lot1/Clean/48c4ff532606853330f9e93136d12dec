Michael,

I have not heard a whisper of an indecent suggestion or even so much as a
rude joke (at least, not on Child_Lit) in days.

However, thank you so much for all you do for this list (and no doubt
elsewhere as well).

Subject: [child_lit] I've written to Hotmail

Dear Sirs, 

Here is a copy of the letter I have sent to the abuse@hotmail help line. You
might also want to write to them directly, with a copy of the abusive post
in original form. Meanwhile I will keep trying at Rutgers. Way back when, I
used to know the "list administrators" very well, because there was much to
discuss about operating elists, but in the last five or six years things
have been pretty smooth and, except from occasionally writing to ask them to
please install free text searching for the archives, we haven't had much
memorable intercourse. But I will be able to go in to the office on Monday
and will start calling numbers until I find someone who thinks s/he can
help. In the meanwhile, I think we should simply continue with list
discussion and ignore the siren song of lascivious spam as best we can. 

Copy of hotmail letter follows 

Dear Sir: 

I have just forwarded you 14 posts in original form that I received
apparently from Hotmail users. Several or many of these posts carried
original subject lines from child_lit discussions, so they seemed to have
been triggered by list discussion. In addition, I can send thirty or so more
messages, also with Hotmail addresses, I have received from other child_lit
subscribers. However they were not sent to me in the original form and so I
withheld them. If you think it would be helpful, I will write to my
colleagues and determine if they have retained copies that they could either
send to me in original form, or forward to you Cc'ing me and using the same
subject line "Pornographic spam -- child_lit Rutgers." Please let me know
what you think best. 

Anything that you can do to stem the problem or suggest what I might do
would be appreciated. As you know New Jersey just got hit pretty bad by a
pretty serious hurricane, and our office of internet technology has got its
hands full. However I have been in contact with them and they promised to
work on the problem from their end as soon as they could; seeing that all of
the apparent senders of this clearly abusive material use Hotmail accounts,
I'm hoping you might be interested in helping. 

Thanks. 


Best,
