Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Weird BPSK31 Behavior
I should have mentioned that I am running PowerSDR 2.3.5 and fldigi 3.21.49.

Also, the shift between the two spikes seems to depend upon where in the
passband my transmit frequency is.  In some cases the two spikes are nearly
superimposed.

Finally, I just realized that I used COM7 for SDR Memory last night, and
that is one of the ports fldigi uses.  I have not had both programs running
simultaneously.  I did just uninstall SDR memory but still have the same
problems.

Thanks once again.

Subject: [Flexradio] Weird BPSK31 Behavior

I am suddenly experiencing a new problem with my Flex 3000 on PSK.
Everything has been nominal until this morning.  Now, instead of a nice
clean transmit signal on the screen, I have what appear to be two main
spikes.  One is the intended frequency and normal strength.  The second is
considerably lower in strength (40 or more db) and shifted about 1 KHz up in
frequency.

The only things that changed are:
1.  An unexpected and unexplained Windows shutdown and restart (Win 7 64 pro
on a late model i7 machine).  I know PSDR is not supposed to be shut down in
that manner and wonder if something fouled up there?

2. Last night I installed and used SDR Memory.  That seemed to work fine.

Appreciate any help/inputs.
