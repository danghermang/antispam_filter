Slitaz is actually a pretty neat distro though, agreed. If you want a
really super-minimalistic distro that will run in the tiniest of
footprints, may I suggest tinycore?

This will even run on a 486 and there has been some work backporting it
to even the 286.

I like your style though - never chuck away old computers. Someone can
always find something to do with them...
