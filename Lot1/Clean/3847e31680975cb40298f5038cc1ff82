Kirk
Well, you had a chance but you are going off on a tangent again.  It
doesn't matter to me whether you think I am right or wrong.  I see you
are choosing to redefine capture area  again - incorrectly - and
generating another smokescreen in the process.  I don't think the
learning process should be based on spoon-feeding so we'll leave it
for a while until my motivation improves . . I really don't think
anyone else is very much interested in this :).
