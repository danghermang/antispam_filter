Subject:[Jukebox-list] Wurlitzer 2204 Selector Problem - Update
After locating a wire disconnected inside the coin registration unit I was
able to find an identical unit for sale on Ebay.  

I emailed the seller and he graciously emailed me a few close-up pictures of
the wires inside of his.  

I soldered my unit's wires to match his pictures and everything started
working once more.

During the process I've also received some schematics and a PDF copy of the
service manual.

 

Just wanted to pass along my thanks to everyone who took interest in my
situation and help me locate and repair the problem.
