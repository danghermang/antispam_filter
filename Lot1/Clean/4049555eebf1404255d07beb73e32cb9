Subject:Re: [child_lit] Locations in children's literature
Ok, everyone, you are now invited to a virtual wedding...Sarah style, pick the ONE table you want to sit at. But I will let you cheat...you can choose who sits at your table ...from that book, with one visitor from any other book.

I want to sit with Meg Murray and her family, at their kitchen table and the the Mrs. W's are included of course. And our visitor? Pippi might stir things up. Or Catherine, called Birdy. Hmmmm.
