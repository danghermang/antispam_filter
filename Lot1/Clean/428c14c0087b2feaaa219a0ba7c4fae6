Subject:[Jukebox-list] Problem,
 solution. Rockola 484 leaving record and doubling them up
 In The magazine 
Howdy, just figured I would share my problem and solution.
  Issue, after playing my juke for a day, I noticed empty spots in the maga=
zine.  Looking further I noticed some records we doubled up.  Some sets wer=
e completely in the wrong spot.  This has slowly getting worse and worse ov=
er the last few weeks.=20
Solution.
  After watching it run after just turning it on I noticed it left a record=
.  What it appeared to do, when camming the gripper closed it would pick th=
e arm up just a hair.  Sometimes this was enough to just miss the record.  =
Then play the next one on top and pick them both up.=20
  What I did was disassemble the gripper arm by taking the gear screw off, =
and pounding the roll pin out.  Out came gripper, arm, cam, and both gears.=
  A quick alcohol bath and cleaning with nylon brush and it was ready.  I a=
ssembled it with Teflon silicone grease. =20
  It now works like a charm.
