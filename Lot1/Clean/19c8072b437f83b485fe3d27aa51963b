Subject:[Chelsea] Amazing
I'm exhausted. Breathless. And I just watched on TV. Shakhtar tired or decided to shut up shop in the last 20 minutes and we pressed 
But Shakhtar almost scored very late when David Luiz went walkabout, but it was Victor Moses who scored with the last kick and now a draw in Turin will see us through. 
What a great game and how good are Shakhtar?
