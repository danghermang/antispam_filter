Hi birding-aussers,

I have uploaded my photos of the Franklin's Gull to SmugMug. The URL is:

This is my first attempt at using SmugMug, so hopefully everything will work
correctly.

I know lots of birders are interested in this gull. The bird was seen well
from around 9:20am to 10:30am or so in "the usual spot" (the gravel car park
in front of the hardware store). It flew up and down the channel a few times
before finally landing on a piece of concrete on the waterfront. It remained
until finally seen off by a Silver Gull.

A note for those unfamiliar with Paynesville - there is a small tackle shop
in the main drag with a sign that days "Hardware". This is NOT the hardware
store with the car park out front. You need to travel along Wellington St
and turn right over a small bridge to get to the boat ramp and gravel
carpark.

I'll post some pictures somewhere when I get a chance to load them.
