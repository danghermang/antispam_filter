Subject:[Koha] Problems with search in Armenian language
Dear friends,

 

we have recently installed koha 3.8.6. In the previous version we had
problems with indexing Armenian language records. You have kindly suggested
us to follow the instructions under this link
*http://lists.katipo.co.nz/public/koha/2011-January/027171.html* and
everything worked well. 

 

Unfortunately, for the latest version this instruction does not work. We
have made all necessary adjustment but the search engine still does not work
properly. When searching for a record it simply retrievs all existing ones
and only highlits the queired keyword. 

 

Any suggestions?
