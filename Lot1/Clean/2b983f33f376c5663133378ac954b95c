 rest by leading Spurs to victory on Saturday [Mail]
Would you like harismatic coach (RDM) that wins us games (and let's
say with no tactical knowledge) or
perfect tactial skilled coach (let's say that is AVB) nobody likes and
the whole team underperforms ?

I would always choose the first one...hell....some of you guys could
be the coach if the players PLAY FOR YOU the best they can.
Somehow i belive hart is more important than tactic ? (or i'm just a
stupid romantik ?)
