Hi Greg and anyone else,
Darren and I went to Paynesville and saw the Gull over the road from the 
Hardware shop several times between 9.30am and 2pm. Darren got several 
photos of it.
Happy Birding

We might make a dash down to Paynesville to try for the Franklins Gull this
weekend. Can someone please offer any information as to whether the gull is
still at the location and where exactly do we look for it. It appears we
have to drive over the King Street bridge onto Burrabogie Island and look
around the gravel carpark on the south end of the island somewhere.



Thanks



Greg Little
