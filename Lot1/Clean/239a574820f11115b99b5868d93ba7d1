Subject:Re: [EVDL] Pack Cooling

First, sorry for my bad english, not my native language. =

( And that &%=A4# spellchekker is n=E5tt w=E5rking now, totraly brokken tdo=
ay in my homtail.  :-)

"Bogus" ? =

-Probably not.  But maybe a creative marketing department?
Does it say at what C-rate they have done the lab test ?   =

I never trust it when marketing department produces the lab-charts.


But we can do our own test, it is easy, use the deepfreezer! =

My guess:
As the "Ri is terrible at winter". No, I think it is not the "Ri" that is t=
he real problem , =

I beleve it is also the slow movement of our ions and maybe local high pote=
ntial. =

To me it is not the same thing as normal resistance. So if you discharge th=
em very =

very slow.. therefore you probably will find the ions, and the capacity as =
claimed. =

So then it is not a bogus claim? =


But In our lab it did prove to me, in just seconds that they will not work =
at all IRL. =

Only for emergency situations, if we drive very slow and careful. =


We did freeze Ts LFP, 4*40ah,  and some Lfp 90Aha,
 they are(was, in 2009) _totaly_ useless at winter discharges, =

even in this small leafCar-size, high voltage EV, with a big 27 kWh pack. (=
we had 300+Volt..) =


So this type of thunderskys was very very bad in my test..
And also the charging of one cell at 0.3 or 0.5C it seems to have =

damaged it, in just 2-3 cykles =3D some capacity loss, never recovered again
