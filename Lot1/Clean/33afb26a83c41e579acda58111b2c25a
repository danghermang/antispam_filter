 encounters
Hi all, =

I'm a coral biologists and could be wrong but my understanding was that gro=
upers can develop skin lesions and diseases after repeated handling by dive=
rs. I've dived at the Cod Hole on Great Barrier Reef where very large group=
ers, Potato Cod, were fed and touched by divers and many fish had severe sk=
in lesions. Would this have been due to their diet or does handling and rem=
oval of surface mucus also cause skin infections? =

Regards,
Anya

Dear Dr. Frias-Torres

Thank you for your response I appreciate your time.

 I would like to clearly state that I did not depict you as an
irresponsible scientist.  As I mentioned the work you are doing is
essential and you clearly have a wealth of knowledge and experience in
this area. I also agree that there are far bigger concerns facing
groupers other than physical interaction but we, as scientist,
understand the real problem at hand and how to interact with wildlife
responsibly.

 I would like to draw your attention to your target audience for the
video =93 not addressed to scientists but to the SCUBA diving community
...=93 I have worked with many SCUBA divers over the years and time and
time again I see divers touching marine wildlife, not just curious
fish but also marine mammals and coral species. I think SCUBA divers
are a key element in ecotourism however I do have experience with
divers copying what they see other divers or scientist do,  and that
includes touching and chasing.

Yes there are countless YouTube videos of people landing endangered
species and irresponsibly handling and also footage of divers
generally harassing marine life,  these people are the uneducated that
we need to set an example for - and this is your target audience.

 Obviously It would be better to have a group of experienced divers
interacting passively with groupers than for them to be hooked -  but
not all divers have experience or knowledge in marine interactions,
they simply copy what they see.

Best,

Martin
