Not sure,  but what does my the recent thread about the government using
Microsoft and facebook (among a few others) tell you about their policies.

Maybe its something the UK free software foundation (or similar) should
be involved with that way there could be a one stop shop to go to,  and
sign a petition or something to ask websites to use open standards.

They may already be involved,  so maybe someone here can provide a link
we can all go to.
