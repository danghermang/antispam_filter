Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Wurlitzer 1500 and 1550 decal set
I am just finishing restoring a W1500A and I got my decals from Victory
Glass in Des Moines, Iowa. Be careful of that model -- it is a nightmare --
I call it "Satan's Jukebox." It is a mechanical disaster and unless you
have lots of experience with jukeboxes think twice before tackling this 479
pound monster. Good luck.
