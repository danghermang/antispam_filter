Some of these reports are scandalous...and must be bordering libellous.
The one by Mark Irwin in particular.

I'm not sure whether 'reporting' in this country can get any worse or of
a lower standard... the platform they have in propagating their clear
agenda, rather than actually "reporting" on a match is a damn disgrace.
I would rather these hacks just crawl back under the stones where they
clearly reside. 

As for the game itself, an underpar performance where I think games are
coming too thick & fast to maintain the sparkling level we've shown. And
also demonstrated that our squad is thinner than required.

For all of those previously calling for Romeu to be a first choice (in
place of Mikel!!), I hope its now all too apparent why that shouldn't
happen. The deficiencies in his game I've previously highlighted & were
all too evident Saturday.

For all Swansea's "spirit", they were threatless until the equalizer &
we got exactly what we deserved for the earlier profligacy. Torres'
ballooning a header into a scrambling Tremmell's arms when either an
accurate header to the near post or time to bring down and pass into the
net was the worse example. There was a good penalty shout too when
Ashley Williams cleared pushed Hazard over from behind...that apart, one
of the better referee displays this season. Wonder how that's going to
pan out with the murmours of a ref "boycott". Anyone any ideas how that
works? I often feel we'd get better results without a ref!
