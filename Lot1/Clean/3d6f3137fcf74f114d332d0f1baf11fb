Subject:[MG] Freenode channel #metagov
We registered #metagov on freenode IRC yesterday.  This allows us to
administer the channel.  If you don't have an IRC client, you can
connect here: http://irc.lc/freenode/metagov/guest@@@

Conseo and I currently have equal admin rights.  To see everyone's
rights, type this:

  /msg chanserv access #metagov list

To see the available rights:

  /msg chanserv help flags

The channel isn't active at the moment, but we monitor it.  Logs are
posted here: http://zelea.com/var/cache/irc/metagov/

If anyone needs help using it, please let us know.
