Subject:[Birding-Aus] RFI:   Comparison of Olympus digital recorders
Hello all

<>
Last week I decided to buy a hearing aid and immediately found the 
difference for discerning bird calls remarkable. At the local 
supermarket on Saturday morning I was hearing a Little Wattlebird and a 
Greenfinch calling simultaneously and the sound was so loud and clear 
compared to anything heard for decades, it has encouraged a new found 
interest in sound.

Having already in my possession an Olympus DM-550 digital sound recorder 
and now, with all this new found enthusiasm, I am hoping that someone 
with knowledge could give me an indication about the usefulness of my 
existing unit as I have no knowledge or experience to compare its 
suitability for recording bird song.

Included is a comparison link to other recommended Olympus birdsong 
recorders but I don't know what features are relevant,
