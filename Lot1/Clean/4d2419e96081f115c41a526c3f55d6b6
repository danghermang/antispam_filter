It would need more detail and maybe lots more time to say more, but
here's the overview of one way to do it:

1. figure out which rfid device you have;

2. if it's not a SIP-based device, figure out which rfid tag layout
you have and write or find a driver for the device/layout combination;

3. if it is a SIP-based device, configure it;

4. figure out how to write tags and set security in a suitable way.

Hope that helps,
