I read this too; apparently he feels that Torres took an extra stride after the contact before falling and that is simulation as far as thehe's concerned. So Mr Torres please remember as soon as you feel a touch drop like a stone as you'll get a foul then - hang on wasn't that what Drogba was berated for doing?

I do so hope CFC can make that complaint about his 'inappropriate' language stick.
