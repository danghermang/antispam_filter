Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] crystal radios and the capture area paradox
Here is how my mind works...

Any power that is indeed POWER contains a averaging over infinite time. Tha=
t =

said, nothing is truly POWER. So everything is compromised for some purpose=
. =

In a very simple radar system a pulse of RF (say, 10 microseconds long) and =

repeated every (say, every 10 milliseconds). Now the peak power is defined =

as the power during the pulse and is most essential in the determination of =

the radar performance and design of the receiver. The average power is the =

peak power multiplied by the duty cycle (ratio of the pulse width to the =

pulse to pulse time) and is used to determine the internal heating and powe=
r =

requirements for the radar system.

Here is nice to separate these two essential powers by using adjectives, bu=
t =

it is also clear that the term "average power" is redundant. All "proper" =

power is averaged. The other powers are convenient "misnomers" of some =

practical use.

I think Vrms came from the voltage across a resistor that satisfies =

V=3DSQR(PR) and when used in P=3DV^2/R makes Prms

I think Vave (half the value of half the voltage waveform) has no practical =

use being used for power in P=3DV^2/R.
