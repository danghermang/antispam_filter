Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Alan,

This thread has deteriorated, because you are not being very perceptive.

The ferrite in the loop antenna makes it a much better receiver -- because 
the voltage  presented to the amplifier is increased -- not because the 
received power is increased -- in that the received power is just the same 
(or less, due to ferrite losses).

When you say "extracted power" you mean power extracted from the amplifier, 
not the power input to the amplifier.

The power extracted from the amplifier is greatly increased by the 
ferrite -- because the amplifier is a voltage amplifier.   Of course, the 
power extracted from the amplifier is also increased by adding another 
amplifier stage.

The power extracted from the incident wave is unaffected by the presence of 
the ferrite.

These are the statements that "everybody" agrees with.

" So except for loss the capture area of a ferrite rod antenna is within 10% 
of that of a dipole."
This note points out that many people (including you) confuse effective area 
and effective height.

http://vk1od.net/antenna/concepts/Ae.htm
(IEEE1993) defines effective area (of an antenna) (in a given direction). In 
a given direction, the ratio of the available power AT THE TERMINALS of a 
receiving antenna to the power flux density of a plane wave incident on the 
antenna from that direction, the wave being polarization matched to the 
antenna.

OK, not "everbybody".   Here is a book that confuses "captured" magnetic 
flux with "captured" power:
http://books.google.com/books?id=jqj2k9EXgioC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=antenna+capture+area+ferrite&source=bl&ots=d8IrxQ9PX3&sig=suVr7jYRGRumKx9xNxzc1h71NxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LnmJUN6pNKTI0AGF0YBg&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA

Recall that Collin distinguished between (power) "capture area" (which 
doesn't depend on permeability) and "equivalent area" for "capture" of 
magnetic flux.    The "equivalent area" is enhanced by the ferrite rod, but 
the "capture area" is unchanged.

Thanks for your reply.  How come everyone agrees? I can tell you they
don't - they have more sense than to entertain anything so crass.  My
figures show that 20 dB less power is extracted when the ferrite is
removed.  You seem to be slipping into the role of the mad hatter now
(I'm not planning to waste much time on this).

I know you have no experience with or knowledge of radio, but try
taking a transistor radio, take the ferrite rod antenna out and
replacing it with a coil of the same dimensions.  Everyone (bar one)
knows what the result will be.
