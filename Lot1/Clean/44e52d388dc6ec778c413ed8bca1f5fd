While this may be true in the legal sense (actually, I'm not sure
about this at all), if someone uses your site to serve bad stuff, your
site could be blocked by security software, including anti-phishing
tools built inside browsers these days. Your host could also decide to
take down your site altogether, at least temporarily. In effect this
could mean that few resp. no people could visit your website.

If the stuff they upload is _really_ bad, the police may want to have
a word with you, and they may want to have that word at their place
rather than yours.

Security is not just about protecting your data against theft: at
least 99% of the files on my PC are completely worthless to others and
the chances of someone abusing it are small. (Not zero though: if
someone had access to your PC, they'd probably find a lot of personal
information there. This could be used in identity theft.) Security is
also also about making sure your computers aren't being used to do
harm to the wider Internet.

This is a good point of course, but it makes:
