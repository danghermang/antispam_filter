Well, with my background being the UConn School of  Business, NAEYC, and 
BEA, rather than CLNE, I'll take your word for  it and consider myself 
schooled.  And the next time I write about an  upcoming book involving fictional 
characters and 9/11, I'll be sure to  characterize it as contemporary instead 
of historical (at least until  the year 2021).

I've  researched and written a lot about historical fiction and by and 
large there  is a standard understanding that a reasonable amount of time has to 
have  passed for a book to be considered historical. I've seen twenty years 
used as  a benchmark.  Also, it focuses on real historical events, people, 
and  such.  The author usually makes that clear in back matter.    


I find none of that to be the case here.  The conflict is based on  past 
events in the DRC, but  fictional. We don't read about specifics  that are 
documented historically because this is a fictional conflict.  What is more 
there are cell phones and computers and more to point to a  contemporary 
setting. I just took another look at the back matter and I see  nothing that 
suggest this is historical fiction.  Nothing  


Sadly the conflict continues in the DRC. It is not a thing of the past  nor 
is this book to my mind.

Well, Monica, given that the book is clearly fiction as  opposed to 
nonfiction, it sounds like you might be preparing to  teach some of us -- or at 
least me -- something about the meaning of  historical fiction.
 
Being that I'm still on the road after Rosemary's wedding  and don't have 
K.T.'s book at hand, and Amazon's LOOK INSIDE! feature for  FROM COVER TO 
COVER does not include page 171 (which  is  where Horning's definition of 
historical fiction seems to reside), I  am, instead, left relying on the handy 
Wikipedia  definition for a source with which to craft a response:
 
"Historical fiction tells a story that is  set in the past. That setting is 
usually real and drawn from history, and  often contains actual historical 
persons, but the main characters tend to be  fictional. Writers of stories 
in this genre, while penning fiction, attempt  to capture the manners and 
social conditions of the persons or time(s)  presented in the story, with due 
attention paid to period detail and  fidelity."
 
Perhaps, from your question, you are suggesting that  ENDANGERED takes 
place in the present or in the future instead of the recent  past.  If there is 
information in the story that proves the  present or future is, in fact, the 
time setting intended, then I missed  it.  My assumption is that the story 
takes place in the relatively  recent past.  I saw nothing in the technology 
to suggest futurism, and  nothing to pinpoint it as being this year instead 
of a few years  ago.
 
It seems clear to me that the setting is real and  drawn from history.  The 
back matter shows the extent to which the  author seeks to give the story 
authenticity.  There are repeated  instances in which the author has Sophie 
providing us information about the  history of D.R. Congo, both the more 
distant Belgian-related past as well  as the last 24 year war-period past.  The 
author also seems, to  me, to seek to capture the manners and social 
conditions of the times.   For instance, we are repeatedly reminded through the 
information we are  provided in the story, combined with the manner in which 
some of the other  characters speak to Sophie, as well as the thoughts Sophie 
sometimes shares,  that she is a half-black, half-white person and that this 
makes a difference  in this historical setting.  And so I feel that we are 
getting enough  of the past to characterize this as being historical fiction 
even if  you feel that it, instead, should be labeled contemporary fiction. 
 But  I am only taking guesses at why you've asked me the question.
