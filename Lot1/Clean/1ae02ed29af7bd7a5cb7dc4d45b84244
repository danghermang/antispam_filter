Subject:lists.kongisking.net mailing list memberships reminder
This is a reminder, sent out once a month, about your
lists.kongisking.net mailing list memberships.  It includes your
subscription info and how to use it to change it or unsubscribe from a
list.

You can visit the URLs to change your membership status or
configuration, including unsubscribing, setting digest-style delivery
or disabling delivery altogether (e.g., for a vacation), and so on.

In addition to the URL interfaces, you can also use email to make such
changes.  For more info, send a message to the '-request' address of
the list (for example, wzcynvj-tsmuvev@lists.kongisking.net)
containing just the word 'help' in the message body, and an email
message will be sent to you with instructions.

If you have questions, problems, comments, etc, send them to
mailman-owner@lists.kongisking.net.  Thanks!
