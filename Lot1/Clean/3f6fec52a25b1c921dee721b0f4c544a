Subject:[child_lit] bi-polar or depressed parents
Dear All, a friend has asked me to recommend stories about bi-polar parents.
She is asking for a close friend whose daughter has split with her husband
who is bi-polar. She has two children, 5 and 8, and mother does not seem to
be doing a good job explaining to them that the father is sick. Any
suggestions? There is a new Australian picture book by Sharon McGuinness
called "Coming Home", which does it well. But I think something more
complex, at least for the eight year old. Didn't Ann Fine write something?

 

Thanks for your help in advance, Virginia
