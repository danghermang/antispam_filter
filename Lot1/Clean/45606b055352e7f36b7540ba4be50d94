Subject:[meteorite-list] looking for...
Dear List Members,

I'm looking for any of those meteorites:
Bald mountain
Dunhua
Bukhara
Tieschitz
Nassirah
Yafa

I know that some of them will probably will not be easy to get but I'm asking anyway.
Please contact me off list if you can help me to get any of them.

Thank you,
Marcin.
