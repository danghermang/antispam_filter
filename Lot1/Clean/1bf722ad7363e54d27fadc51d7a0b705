Subject:Re: [EVDL] Cross Country EV?
You need about 150-200 pounds of Lithium batteries for every gallon of gas you want to displace...

So if you had a vehicle that got 25MPG with an ICE and you want a 500 mile range you'll need approx 3,000-4,000 pounds of Lithium batteries...and then you're using a lot of the energy just to push the energy around...this is why there are no practical/affordable 500 mile EVs....we cannot change the laws of physics.

When someone invents a superior battery technology things will change...I'll believe when I see it...
