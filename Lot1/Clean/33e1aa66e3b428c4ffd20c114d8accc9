Hi Philip,
              Yes, your interpretation is correct that I was referring to the northern Queensland form of the Little Shrike-thrush. You might appreciate that Victorians may not be familiar with this rufous form and therefore might be more likely to look for an alternative species when they see the rufous form (hence the prospect of it being a Bower's Shrike-thrush is explored). To locals in northern Queensland that is not an issue. You of course correctly identify the other features of the bird that exclude Bower's Shrike-thrush.

Having said that the geography is pretty clear Philip - the Wet Tropics is 1000 km south of Cape York. Bower's Shrike-thrush does not get even close to Cape York. The nearest rainforest to Cape York is the Lockerbie scrub, but even much further south, Bower's Shrike-thrush is absent from the rainforests of Iron Range and Macillwraith Range and Cape Melville (probably the most southern area of rainforest that might be labelled part of Cape York Peninsula). Unfortunately most people do not use the location "Cape York" correctly and usually use that name when they actually mean Cape York Peninsula, as I suspect was the case for the original image (but happy to be corrected). The northern extent of the wet tropics (for example Windsor Tableland or Bloomfield area) would not normally be referred to as part of Cape York Peninsula. It might be a moot point where Cape York Peninsula might be said to begin but generally the term does not overlap in common use with the Wet Tropics Regi
 on. There are many such endemics that are present in the Wet Tropics but absent from Cape York Peninsula rainforests, which in character and biodiversity more closely resemble New Guinea than the Gondwanan nature of the Wet Tropics. But of course there is some overlap.

Hello Peter,

I'm not disputing as it appears to have a whitish face, not coloured face
and doesn't appear to have a stripy front and on size I think you are right.
Can I clarify? I'm assuming by "The northern Queensland form", you are
referring to The northern Queensland form of Little Shrike-thrush. My
looking at a book shows Bower's Shrike-thrush is as much or more rufous.
Then you write "Bower's Shrike-thrush is confined to upland rainforest in
the Wet Tropics." The original post says the bird was on Cape York. Is Cape
York not "upland rainforest in the Wet Tropics?" Sorry I don't follow that.

Hi Jude,
                There is no doubt it is a Little Shrike-thrush. The northern
Queensland form is distinctly rufous as the image clearly shows (it's former
name was Rufous Shrike-thrush).  As other posts also indicate, Bower's
Shrike-thrush is confined to upland rainforest in the Wet Tropics.

best wishes,



Peter Valentine
