Subject:Re: [ARIN-consult] [arin-announce] Fee Schedule Change Consultation
It has been brought to my attention that I should make something clear here...

My thoughts on this subject are my own. They do not represent ARIN or the ARIN AC.

The fact that I am a member of the AC does not in any way affect or influence my
statements and nothing I have said is in any way intended to represent the thoughts,
beliefs or opinions of anyone other than myself personally as an individual.
