Subject:Re: [EVDL] Best EV Tires
Hi Cor,

I had heard before the newer tires would lead to a drop in mileage and they
would slowly break in and mileage would improve.  I had also heard that the
Toyo Z800 Ultra were a pretty good tire for mileage (although not
specifically LRR).  

That is why I was so pleased when the NEW Michelin Energy Saver A/S were
beating the well worn tires Toyo by 5%.

I should point out that I also discovered the single most important factor
in economy was driving style.  Especially coasting.  You have invested a lot
of energy in getting up to highway speed.  If you can coast, you turn that
into distance.  If you apply the friction brakes, you simply turn it into
heat.

Even if you have regen, it's still better to coast than regen.  Keep the
energy as kinetic energy and you don't have to pay any conversion losses.
By paying attention to traffic and leaving a good following distance, you
can do remarkably well by simply coasting.

Having LRR tires means you can coast further.  They don't help that much,
though, if you're tailgating and having to brake frequently.  Of course, the
LRR tires mean you're also spending less energy while cruising, but every
full stop from 60 mph to zero is energy you could have used to coast another
1/2 to 3/4 mile.
