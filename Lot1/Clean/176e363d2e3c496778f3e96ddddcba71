Chelsea had a younger team than United! by @ChelseaActivity

Things annoy me, so I write about them. One thing in particular was
the reports after the League cup win against Man United that was a
thrilling match, ending 5-4 in favour of the Blues.

But, what the media pick up on is how "young" Manchester United were
and that Chelsea played a "stronger" side. Now I don't know what
defines stronger. Is it age? Experience? How much the players earn?
Who knows, only the commentators and journliasts that write it know
what they're on about=85 So, I decided to do some basic googling of the
players in both teams from last night. Here is what I gathered:

Chelsea FC
[Team: Cech, Azpilicueta, Cahill, Luiz, Bertrand, Romeu (Oscar), Mikel
(Ramires), Mata, Moses, Piazon (Hazard), Sturridge. Unused subs:
Hilario, Ferreira, Marin, Saville]

Average age of starting XI - 23.5 years old
^ of whole match day squad - 24.3 years old
Average age of players that played - 23.3 years old

Manchester United FC
[Team: Lindegaard, Rafael, Buttner (Powell), Wootton, Keane, Anderson
(Tunnicliffe), Giggs, Nani, Fletcher, Hernandez, Welbeck (Macheda).
Unused subs: Johnstone, Vermijl, Lingard, Brady]

Average age of starting XI - 24.8 years old
^ of whole match day squad - 22.8 years old
Average age of players that played - 23.6 years old

Conclusion: Chelsea started with a younger team than United, although
United had a younger team to choose from compared to Chelsea. Despite
this, United and Chelsea - to be fair - had a very equal squad in
terms of age, United with 0.3 years older than the Blues.

Unfortunately for Chelsea, United are plastered with "young" tags,
making their loss feel like a lighter defeat. Even though the fourteen
players that played on the pitch for both sides were almost equal in
terms of average age. Even the Sir himself, Alex Ferguson said that
United were "too young to cope", which from what I have drawn
together, is utter bullsh*t.

Chelsea deserve a lot more credit for their win, especially coming
back from an unfair defeat on Sunday. It's just a shame the media have
it in for Chelsea 24/7.
