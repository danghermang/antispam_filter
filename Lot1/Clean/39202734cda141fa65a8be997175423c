Subject:Re: [EVDL] Elcon PFC 1500 Died
The latest craze of "my charger is bigger than your charger" is a bit of
a spectacle.  Most EV's are charged at home overnight where a faster
charger just creates a higher fire risk.  Furthermore, the 1937 Jaguar I
converted charges off solar panels most of the time.  In this case a
Chinoz/Chennic/Elcon 1500 on 110v is JUST what the doctor ordered (working
great so far..).  Any faster and it would pull from the grid instead of the
panels.  And that would not be right.

EVERY use case is different.  There is no panacea charging solution.  There
isn't even a level 2 charging station in the entire state of MT! (unless
you count my grandma's dryer plug |-)

So lets all try to get our minds off OUR particular use case, and expand
our horizons to include the experiences and desires of other EV'ers.

As for "sloppy" EV's, do you have pics of your conversions?  How about your
battery packs, are they IP67?  Your motor, water and dust proof?
 Submersible?  Your wires?  All encased in waterproof flexible conduit I
assume.  The entire car built to satisfy MIL-SPEC 4150C and MIL-STD810G
 "Ruggedized"????

No, I didn't think so.  Sloppy, sloppy.... tisk tisk.
