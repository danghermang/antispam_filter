Welcome to a new month of discussions about antennas and such!

Thank you all for making this an interesting and useful forum
from which new friendships have flourished from around the globe.

We will publish a new month's issue of antenneX later today.

Thanks for being a member of this special forum!
It's a thought-provoking and friendly place to be.

Don't hesitate to join in the discussions or start one
yourself with a question or observation.

Best regards,
