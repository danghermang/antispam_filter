Subject:Re: [EVDL] Regen vs. coast was Best EV Tires
I do very similar Don.  I always look far ahead to see the state of stop
lights, and traffic.  If I see a light turn red I ease up the accelerator
'til the battery current is zero and coast until I get up closer, then start
slowly increasing regen to come to a stop at the waiting cars.  And like
you, I will wait a bit longer and apply regen stronger closer to the light
if someone is behind me so I don't annoy them.  I have the max regen set
fairly strong, so if necessary I can wait and slow the car fairly quickly,
similar to how most ice drivers would stop.  Even in this case I have had
some more impatient drivers accelerate to go around me and then come to an
abrupt stop at the light 100 yds down the road.  Yes, it is kind of fun
seeing if I can come to a complete stop with regen only, or time it just
right so I get there just after the light turns green and cars are pulling
away.  Of course in heavier traffic you pretty much have to go with the
flow, but most don't accelerate or decelerate that fast so I can still
usually get to less than 5 mph with regen before applying mechanical brakes.
