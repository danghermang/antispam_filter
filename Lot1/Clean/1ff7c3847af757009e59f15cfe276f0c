Also Tree, Fox Sparrow joining regulars (including still many White-crowned Sps). Also both Kinglets, Hermit Thrush. Today 1st yr Peregrine Falcon with dark helmet zooming through the sparrow lanes, as was an adult male Merlin.  Yesterday, a Merlin was following a male N Harrier flushing birds.  Merlin never caught birds he chased (at least 2 lucky Goldfinches) and headed over to Long Island.
