Joel,

I think you're flirting with danger.  I vaguely remember that an ADC 9"
wants to stay under 5500 rpm.  You can take it higher, but only briefly and
under low-heat conditions, or if you've prepped it for higher rpm.  The
fact that a VW bus has a stump-puller first gear means it's very easy to
spin your motor way too fast.  I'm also concerned that without a clutch
your shifting is perhaps more herky-jerky than it might otherwise be.  You
really don't want to be wound tight in first gear and have a
neutral/throttle timing glitch that overspeeds your motor.  You won't like
the price tag.  If your controller doesn't have some kind of overspeed
limiting you need a tach.  At the very least, mark your speedo with top
speeds in each gear.  I wouldn't trust published data for ratios.  It's not
hard to measure overall ratios directly (distance traveled per motor rev,
both measured precisely).

I'm just outside Philadelphia, and I know there are a few pretty steep
hills.  I can see you going up one in first, holding up traffic and blowing
a shift to second that scatters your motor.  If it was mine I'd put the
clutch back in - really easy to do in a bus.  I'd also stop using first
gear.  I doubt you really need it, and the efficiency loss is likely to be
very small.  If you want to fine tune things a bit, aren't there different
ratios available for the wheel-side gear cases?  (Sorry, my bus knowledge
is pretty rusty.)
