Subject:Re: [kurtlist] Random idea

I really love the idea but I know I am one of craziest ;)

Another disc I'd love to have is Canadian Stars On Ice. I really wish
IMG release DVDs of past CSOI tours, in longer version like radio
canada broadcast. I would not mind having a box set of 20 years of
CSOI. :)

Sachi
