The Clarke Letter To Elden E Benge of Jan 15th 1921

 

The letter which came to us via bandmaster Mr Tim Wright of 

Chilliwack BC, provides a an insight into a historically significant 

event in musical history. This letter clearly defines Clarke's view 

of the trumpet and also demonstrates his debased knowledge of the 

trumpet. Further Elden E Benge became a world class soloist on the 

Trumpet and a authority on the instrument.The letter which was 

written on the letterhead of the ANGLO CANADIAN LEATHER CO Band of 

Huntsville, Ontario Canada was the result of an inquiry by Elden 

Benge. Clarke was the bandmaster of the band from 1918-1923 and 

eventually returned to the United States becoming the director of the 

Long Beach California Municipal band until his death in 1945.

 

Mr. Elden E. Benge

Winterset, IA

 

My dear Mr. Benge:-

 

Replying to yours of the 19th just received, would not advise you to 

change from Cornet to Trumpet, as the latter instrument is only a 

foreign fad for the time present, and is only used properly in large 

orchestras of 60 or more, for dynamic effects, and was never intended 

as a solo instrument.

 

I never heard of a real soloist playing before the public on a 

Trumpet. One cannot play a decent song even, properly, on it, and it 

has sprung up in the last few years like "jaz" music, which is the 

nearest Hell, or devil, in music. It polutes the art of Music.

 

Am pleased that you are making improvements in your playing. Keep it 

up, and become a great Cornet Player. You have an equal chance with 

all the rest, but you must work for it yourself.

 

Wishing you all the best of success, I remain

 

Sincerely yours,

 

"Herbert L Clarke"
