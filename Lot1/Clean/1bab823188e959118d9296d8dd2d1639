Subject:Re: [EVDL] Cross Country EV?

I think EV's will always feel overpriced.  The truth is you are replacing a gas tank which likely costs less than $100 to manufacture with a multi-thousand dollar battery pack.  It is possible that with mass manufacturing the electric drivetrain might be able to be produced for less than an ICE drivetrain as they are potentially of simpler design which might offset some cost but I'm not sure there is enough of a potential cost savings there to offset the battery premium you have to pay, and I don't think you will ever be able to produce a battery pack for the same cost as a tin can full of air :)
