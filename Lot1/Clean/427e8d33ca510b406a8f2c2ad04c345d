Subject:[burners] [OT] possible [event] Ableton 9 Live Demo by Hobotech?
Hi Folks,

We're about 15 people short at $10 a head this weekend to get Hobotech out
to the Asylum to demo Ableton Live 9.

It would be this Saturday from 6pm-8pm(ish).

Anyone out there interested?  We need to know by this afternoon.
