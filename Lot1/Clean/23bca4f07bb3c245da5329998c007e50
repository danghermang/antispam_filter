Perhaps it's just propaganda by the new manufacturers of the Plastic Trombone  to sell more of their 
colorful Trombones.  :))

I'm not sure how brass instruments are made, but if they are soldered, it
is likely there is some lead in the solder (although modern solders are 
now
lead free).

But this is so small I would have thought you were far more likely to
get lead poisoning from all the other sources of lead in our environment.
Like petrol, paint and water pipes, all now lead free, but you will
have been exposed to plenty before they became lead free.

Certainly not a reason to change your blowing habits.
