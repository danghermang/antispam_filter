Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] The birds and the bees - nectar feeders
Hi Tim,
I live in Epping, NSW and in my local area there are masses of flowers. The
local bush is full of flowering gums & blueberry Ash & all the street
planted Paperbarks are out. We have Little Lorikeets about & they are rarely
seen in my area, as well as the usual Musks & Rainbows. Several bush
reserves near me have unusually high numbers of Scarlet Honeyeaters & there
are plenty of New Hollands and White-cheeked as well.

Subject: [Birding-Aus] The birds and the bees - nectar feeders

Hi all,

I've just heard an interesting report on ABC Radio Australia about the fact
that commercial beekeepers, in terms of nectar production, are having one of
their worst seasons on record. The report suggests, that due to our wet
winter and cool spring, trees and shrubs are putting all their energy in the
development of green growth rather than flowering. See

http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2012-11-12/falling-nectar-pro
duction-leads-to-honey-drought/1044622.

Anecdotally, I also think the lack of flowering has had an impact the number
of nectar feeding birds i.e. our honeyeaters and lorikeets. Personally I've
noticed far less lorikeets about the place. For instance, just this morning
on my ride to work (through Royal Park in Melbourne) there were virtually no
lorikeets. Interestingly the main type of lorikeet I did see (hear) was
Little Lorikeet.

The report concludes that our plants are still growing but it will take 12
months to see the benefits, and that this time next year we'll be having a
good honey season. I'm speculating that the same applies to our nectar
feeding birds, certainly across southern and eastern Australia. In theory
spring 2013 will be the 'year' of the nectar feeders!

Cheers,

Tim
