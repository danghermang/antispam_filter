Subject:[OzFurry] MiDFur: Rego's Almost Gone!
HE BUNKER IS ALMOST FULL!

We've just received word from our Memberships department and they've
informed us that MIDFUR IS ALMOST FULL!

That's right, MiDFur's Rego's are piling in, and we're breaking the verge
of the Arrow's Capacity! There's less than a quarter of MiDFur's overall
spaces left, and pre-registrations close on Nov 20!

That means if you plan on registering on the day, you may very well miss out!

So if you're fairly certain MiDFur is where you want to be this Dec 4-8,
REGISTER NOW

http://www.midfur.com.au/index.php/register1/|

Even if you only plan on attending one or two days, options for Day-passes
and 3-day pass are available online!

THE SKY IS FALLING!!!!!

IT'S NEARRRRLLY HERE!

24 Days till IT ALL ENDS!!!
