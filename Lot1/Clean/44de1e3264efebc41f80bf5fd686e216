Subject:[Coral-List] Dr. Starck
Hey, folks, I know Dr. Starck is well known (now, anyway) and that he's
starting become celebrity status, and so is considered fair game and
out-of-reach for defamation litigation, but I would appreciate it if we do
not issue personal invectives  against the fellow, especially since he's
not on the list.

Thanks,
    Jim
