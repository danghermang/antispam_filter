John,

Indeed, the ferrite antenna is more compact, IF the goal is to keep the =

inductance of the antenna at a given value.

This seems not to be the goal in AM radios........

And, lots of crystal radios use small coils and work just fine.

However, I agree that your comment is an aspect of the answer.

Simple answer: The ferrite rod antenna is much more compact.  For a crystal =

set, the loop is typically about a square meter in area, or more.
