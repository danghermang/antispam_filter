Monica asks how I see this as historical fiction.
 
Well, Monica, given that the book is clearly fiction as  opposed to 
nonfiction, it sounds like you might be preparing to teach  some of us -- or at 
least me -- something about the meaning of historical  fiction.
 
Being that I'm still on the road after Rosemary's wedding and  don't have 
K.T.'s book at hand, and Amazon's LOOK INSIDE! feature for FROM COVER  TO 
COVER does not include page 171 (which  is where Horning's  definition of 
historical fiction seems to reside), I  am, instead, left relying on the handy 
Wikipedia  definition for a source with which to craft a response:
 
"Historical fiction tells a story that is set  in the past. That setting is 
usually real and drawn from history, and often  contains actual historical 
persons, but the main characters tend to be  fictional. Writers of stories 
in this genre, while penning fiction, attempt to  capture the manners and 
social conditions of the persons or time(s) presented in  the story, with due 
attention paid to period detail and fidelity."
 
Perhaps, from your question, you are suggesting that  ENDANGERED takes 
place in the present or in the future instead of the recent  past.  If there is 
information in the story that proves the present or  future is, in fact, the 
time setting intended, then I missed it.  My  assumption is that the story 
takes place in the relatively recent past.  I  saw nothing in the technology 
to suggest futurism, and nothing to pinpoint  it as being this year instead 
of a few years ago.
 
It seems clear to me that the setting is real and drawn  from history.  The 
back matter shows the extent to which the author seeks  to give the story 
authenticity.  There are repeated instances in which  the author has Sophie 
providing us information about the history of D.R. Congo,  both the more 
distant Belgian-related past as well as the last 24 year  war-period past.  The 
author also seems, to me, to seek to capture the  manners and social 
conditions of the times.  For instance, we are  repeatedly reminded through the 
information we are provided in the story,  combined with the manner in which 
some of the other characters speak to Sophie,  as well as the thoughts Sophie 
sometimes shares, that she is a half-black,  half-white person and that this 
makes a difference in this historical  setting.  And so I feel that we are 
getting enough of the past to  characterize this as being historical fiction 
even if you feel that it,  instead, should be labeled contemporary fiction. 
 But I am only taking  guesses at why you've asked me the question.
