Subject:qt3 in wheezy options to install it
Hello,

In near future I would like install on my machines wheezy and I know
that old qt3 libraries are removed (as obsolete)
But in my commercial work we still use qt-3 so  I would like to know
how can I install it instead of plain
compiling from sources (last option).

Regards,
Karol Szkudlarek
