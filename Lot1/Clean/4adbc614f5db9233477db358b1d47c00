Subject:[Chelsea] Captain, La Liga,
 legend? Valencia 'have offered Terry a January move' [Mirror]
[HS: And just for good measure...]

Agent claims he's involved in talks, that have been going on for two
weeks, about taking the Chelsea skipper to Spain in the winter window

By Neil McLeman

Valencia want to buy John Terry in the January transfer window.

The former England captain has been fined by Chelsea, on top of his
four-match FA ban for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand.

Now, FIFA agent Francois Gallardo has claimed Terry has been offered
the chance to relaunch his career in the Primera Liga.

Valencia are ready to hand the 31-year-old defender an 18-month
contract - with the option for another year.

Gallardo told Radio Intereconomia: "Valencia are negotiating, and I am
involved in person, with the signing in the winter transfer market.

"The offer is on his table. The player is out of contract in June and
will not renew there for several reasons at Chelsea and he wants to
come to Spain.

Gallardo added: "Terry has problems. They are insulting him and he is
not taking it anymore. He asked to leave, not us.

"It's real. This has been going on for 15 days and two meetings have
already took place. The deal is already on his table - a year and a
half plus one.

"I think he will accept."
