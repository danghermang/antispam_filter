Ah is *easier* to measure, but it is *meaningless* as a measurement unless =
you have a clue about the voltage. Indeed Wh is the gold standard of energy=
 consumption. (In fact, it is directly related to the unit of energy, Joule=
 =3D Ws (Watt*second)
My current truck uses 3Ah where my previous truck used about 1Ah on the sam=
e distance. That does not mean that my current truck has 3x the consumption=
 in Watthours, because today I have a 120V pack while I used to have 312V i=
n my previous truck, so the consumption has only risen slightly (mostly due=
 to the losses in the automatic transmission in this truck)

This is why I always thought that it would be better to talk watt-hours per=
 mile, but I thought that there was some previous discussion that amp-hours=
 was a better way to describe it.

Thanks;

The vehicle requires a specific number of watt-hours per mile. Amps times v=
olts equals watts. If the voltage is lower, (because the pack is at a lower=
 state of charge,) the amp-hours must increase to make the same number of w=
att-hours.
