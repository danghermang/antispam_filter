You can add a new delivery address.. fairly sure because I did it while 
in hospital (I wanted earplugs), but yes that's a fair point regarding 
the email.  Having said that there's nothing to stop a burglar staying 
around if they know the occupants are away on holiday.  Plus if they pay 
for next day delivery they can minimise possibility of being caught.  
Yes I know I'm being paranoid/devious but then the criminal classes are 
often equally devious.

I just picked Amazon as one of the companies mentioned in the original 
email :)

IANAL either :) however, I worked in (OK was the Senior Tech for) the 
AUP team of the ISP I worked for until I left about 8 years ago.  It 
wasn't uncommon for us to get warrants from the police (a Section 28.3 I 
think?) for the release of personal data regarding customers, so I'm 
*fairly* sure the first person the police would look at for any illegal 
activity would be the customer.  The burden of proof would *I think* be 
on the police to prove the customer was complicit in the use,  but even 
if as you suggest, they just want a word, I agree it's aggravation best 
avoided.
