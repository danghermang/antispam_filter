Subject:Re: [burners] Funding for cultural flashmobs from The Boston
	Foundation
I found out about this a couple of days ago.  The way they have written the
guidelines, you pretty much have to tie the flash mob/guerrilla art piece
to some sort of ethnic heritage from one of Boston's (as in the actual City
of Boston) 140 ethnic communities (e.g., African-American, Haitian-Creole,
Puerto Rican, Somalian, Polish, Italian, Iranian, Vietnamese, whatever).

I am running two projects next year.  FIGMENT will be one of them.  The
other one is in development and not ready for a full public announcement,
but I am hoping to get access to the space in Roxbury where truck load was
(and where we were locked out of unload) for a year of events.

If anyone who is part of an ethnic group in Boston (not the surrounding
cities) wants to pursue this grant and have the flash mob/guerilla art
piece at either FIGMENT or the planned Roxbury event location, feel free to
get in touch.  I'm not going to write the grant proposal myself since I
don't have a particular ethnic group to bring together, but I will be happy
to support you in your proposal if it sounds workable.

Jason
