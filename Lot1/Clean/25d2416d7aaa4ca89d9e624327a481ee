Subject:[Jukebox-list] Rock-ola Rocket II Model 5500-IX
Looking for the best source for a schematic of the power supply in this CD 
jukebox. Power supply 56205-A which is the power supply in the box. I see 
that according to the assembly part numbers section I had that it is 
supposed to have a 56205-1a but I don't have a schematic of either to see 
what the differences are. Since it has the 56205A power supply and the 
person said it used to work I have to assume( god I hate that word) that he 
is right.

Also looking for a copy of the schematic for the 280 watt amplifier 
56180-1A.

Seems the previous owner liked 20 amp fuses where the 1 and 3 amp fuses were 
to go so its going to be fun.

Anyone having a copy of the manual or a source please email me off list.

Of course I could use a whole manual if someone has it as I got a feeling I 
may need one.


Again thanks
Steve/Florida
