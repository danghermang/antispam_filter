Yes the latter was option 3 of my suggestions to Neil W and the one I 
use in the home.  I don't assign static IPs to WiFi devices for the 
simple reason they may clash with other devices if I go to, for example, 
a friend's house who also has a Virginmedia Superhub on the same default 
IP range - or any Netgear as the VM is a rebadged Netgear CG3101D or 
VMDG480.. I suspect the latter is heavily modified hence the VM prefix, 
or that could be a coincidence as it is a Netgear model number.
