Well - if Paul isn't offering training, then I am ;-)

The Linux distro that most peopel are running right now is Raspbian - this 
is Debian Testing (aka Wheezy) specifically compiled to match the Pi's 
FPU. The Pi architecture doesn't fall neatly into Debians ARM releases, so 
if you do with standard Debian, it's software floating-point.

On the webcam front - You can connect a webcam up, but the issues you'll 
face will be to do with coding/transcoding the video stream from the 
camera into something usable. Unless you can use the GPU, then it'll be 
done in software on the ARM. That's the slow 700MHz ARM (or 1.1GHz 
overclocked if you're lucky)

Then there's the issue of getting the data somewhere else - lets stream it 
over the Ethernet - Ah. Slight issue there - maybe - the Pi only have one 
USB interface and the Ethernet is a peripheral on that USB... USB is half 
duplex. So reading from a camera and writing over Ethernet may be 
challenging. Same for writing to a local USB stick...

Sending it to the screen - sure - maybe... Make sure it's a codec the GPU 
understands..

Now there are some new commercial codecs avalable for purchase to allow 
you to use the GPU to do some encoding as well as decoding, but it's not 
an area I'm very familiar with.

Back to your media center - There are other distros avalable and I have 
actually tried one - and amazingly it worked - I was able to play 45 
minutes of video & sound at 720p (that's the best I have). The one I tried 
was Raspbmc. http://www.raspbmc.com/ it takes a while to install - you 
download the installer, then it downloads the rest. I found it a bit 
"clunky" but there you go.

Other than that it's a cheap little Linux box! Does most Linuxy things 
relatively well - it is a little slow at times, but what do you expect for 
30 quid?

There's some intersting stuff on my projects website - but it's mostly 
about hardware interfacing and stuff..
