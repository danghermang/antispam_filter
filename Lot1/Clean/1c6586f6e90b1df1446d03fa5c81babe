Subject:Re: [EVDL] EVLN: Don't 'Jaws of Life' the orange cables
The title is quite misleading, because Jaws of Life are
typically used to open doors and cut pillars to lift the
roof off if a door is stuck or a better access is needed
to a wounded/entrapped passenger.
I have never seen them cut through frame members, which
is typically where conduits for high voltage (as well as
brake lines, fuel lines and so on) always run.

The warning about quiet operation and the inability to
see or hear if the car is ready to "go" is a very valid one.

Subject: Re: [EVDL] EVLN: Don't 'Jaws of Life' the orange cables

I recommend that all high voltage cable runs be in flexible
underground-rated conduit.  This stuff is extremely tough, but also
flexible and yielding in a crash.  Batteries should be heavily secured.
I
am not talking about 1/4" all-thread.  I am suggesting 1/2" or 5/8"
all-thread/bolts.  Do the math on the weight of the battery pack under
10
G's accelleration.  Safety is #1.  All it takes is ONE sloppy EV to give
us
all a bad name.

Cheers,
Marcus
