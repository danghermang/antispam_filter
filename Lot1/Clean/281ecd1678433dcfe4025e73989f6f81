Jim,

High tension wires can of course affect the reception and reporting. I've
had the same issue with auto pause on my 800 and this was due to the
speed/cadence sensor not being placed in line with the magnet properly. As
far as the GPS not receiving from the satellites, I've only every had this
happen in very heavy tree cover out in the boonies. The one issue I did have
that required Garmin assistance was that my heart rate started to
consistently read 250+ beats per minute. I called Garmin and explained that
if that were true I probably would have died. They sent me a new check strap
and sensor for free that the problem was fixed.

Regards,

Riding home today, my Garmin was displaying obviously wrong info.  Speed and
distance were malfunctioning.  I surmise it must have been a problem with
the GPS connection -- perhaps the satellites were having a bad day.  From
time to time, I have had the same issue with the automatic pause, when it
tells me I am not moving, when of course I am.

I thought that when there was a problem with GPS the speed/distance sensor
on my crank/wheel would correct for the problem.  Am I wrong?

When this problem occurs, is there any way to manually turn off the GPS and
rely on the crank/wheel sensor for speed and distance?  I know that if you
are out of satellite coverage it will ask if you want to discontinue
searching and you can reply on the sensors.  However, how to do you do this
when satellites are available, but just not working very well?

I have tried to find the answers in the Garmin manual, but so far have been
unsuccessful.

Any assistance would be most appreciated.

Jim
