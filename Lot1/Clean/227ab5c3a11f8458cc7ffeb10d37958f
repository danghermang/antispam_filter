Subject:[burners] OT: Tickets for Wombat
Just a reminder to attend Wombat this weekend.

 *In order to access the venue where Saturday's classes will be held, YOU
MUST GET A TICKET from Tufts. *
Tickets are free for Tufts students, $10 for all other attendees. To
request a need-based fee waiver, please reply to this email.

Non-students can purchase tickets from the following link:

Also the schedule for classes is posted here:

To everyone who responded to my fan class posting.  Please don't forget to
bring your own props.  Radical self reliance and all!  I've also decided to
add basic isolations to the class.  This might change what I'm allowed to
teach in the 50mins time period.  However, I will be available for
questions after the class.
