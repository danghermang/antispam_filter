HANZAB states that the Dusky Woodswallow usually nests in simple pairs but 
sometimes co-operatively with one to two additional adults assisting with 
incubation and feeding the nestlings and fledgelings.

Here's a question that occurred to me watching our local small group of
DWSs.

In large breeding flocks it's difficult to see, but when you have smaller
numbers DWss usually seem to be in multiples of three. Is this a male and
two females (or vice versa), or a pair and an offspring from last year
helping them with this year's breeding?
