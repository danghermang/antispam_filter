Subject:[Hsqldb-user] user lacks privilege or object not found
Hello *!

Current now our developers tests the software against a DB2 Database. Now we 
want change the development worflow that each developer has its own database 
for the Unit-Tests. The decision is to go in HSQL v2.2.9 direction ...

 
Now I'm struggle to migrate a stored procedure to HSQL. If I execute following 
code, I always get an "user lacks privilege or object not found: USER_LIST"-
Error. If I use static stings instead of the parmeter then it's work.


CREATE PROCEDURE FIND_TABS (IN USER_LIST VARCHAR(500) )
READS SQL DATA DYNAMIC RESULT SETS 1 
  BEGIN ATOMIC 
	DECLARE result CURSOR WITH RETURN FOR
		WITH RECURSIVE
 			T (ORDINAL, INDEX)
			 AS (SELECT 0, 0 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SYSTEM_USERS
 			UNION ALL
 			SELECT ORDINAL + 1, COALESCE (NULLIF (LOCATE (',', 
USER_LIST , INDEX + 1), 0), LENGTH (USER_LIST) + 1)
			 FROM T, INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SYSTEM_USERS
 			WHERE ORDINAL < 10000 AND LOCATE (',', USER_LIST, 
INDEX + 1) <> 0)
 			SELECT * FROM T;
		
	OPEN result;
END


Can someone help me to find my fault.

Thx
Peter
