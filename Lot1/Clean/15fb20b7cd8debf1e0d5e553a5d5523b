Subject:[Jukebox-list] Seeburg 222 and AMI Continental 1
Hello group, hope everyone is doing great. I have two questions to ask . First does anyone know how may omh are in the Seeburg 222 speakers? And my other question is on the AMI continental does anyone have a picture of the diagram on the volume box or knows how to connect a separate speaker and horn to the amp. I tried hooking it up to the amp like the original speaker is but on the other channel, but the sound comes out a little lower than the original speaker. I have change all tubes to new ones but still get the same results. Thank you
