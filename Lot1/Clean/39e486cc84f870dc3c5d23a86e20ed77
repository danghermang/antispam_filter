Subject:[Flexradio] FLEX AUDIO
For those Flex owners who are considering an external stereo amplifier and 
bookshelf speakers to provide high quality audio for your Flex radio, I have 
a like-new Yamaha RX-V990 receiver available for a great price ($100). I 
have used this receiver with excellent results, not only to drive speakers 
for my Flex 5000, but also to provide AM/FM reception in the shack. If you 
have a TV in the shack it will also provide 5.1 channel 350 watt home 
theater capability.

If you have a Flex 5000 with the 2nd receiver, running R1 and R2 to the 
right/left channels allows you to mix and pan the two receiver audio 
channels, works great when operating split or dual-band, and the audio on 
SSB and AM sound fantastic.

In perfect condition, with original manual, remote control, etc.

Also available are a pair of Optimus bookshelf speakers.

Please contact me off-list if you're interested, I will provide specs, 
photos, etc.

Thanks for your time...
