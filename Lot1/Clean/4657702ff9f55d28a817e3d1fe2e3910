Subject: Green Earth Book Award Reading Challenge!!

The Nature Generation is ready to implement a student-focused Green Earth B=
ook Award Reading Challenge!  Information is up on our website at the follo=
wing link:

http://www.natgen.org/march-into-reading/

The idea is to encourage students to read our Green Earth Book Award-winnin=
g books.  Each month, we=92re asking students to read and review as many of=
 our Green Earth Book Award-winning books as they can.  For each book they =
read, students should fill out a book review form or create a fun video/tra=
iler.  At the end of each month, The Nature Generation will award a prize p=
ackage to the student submitting the most reviews/videos.

We are hoping you can help promote the Reading Challenge =96 by getting the=
 information out to children and to schools, librarians, or other organizat=
ions.

Thanks in advance for your help with this!

Jenny
