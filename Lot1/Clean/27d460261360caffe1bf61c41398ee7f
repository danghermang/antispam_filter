Subject:[CT Birds] Blackbirds
10/29  3 PM  Somers horse paddock, just getting ready to lock the horses in 
the barn for the duration when I noticed they were milling nervously around 
the paddock.  Discovered thousands of Grackles and Red-winged blackbirds 
LOUDLY vocalizing in the trees causing more concern for the horses than the 
howling wind!  Suddenly all the birds took to the air blackening the sky 
over my barn and paddock; source of the frenzy? a Red-tailed Hawk giving 
chase!!!
