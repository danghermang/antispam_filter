Subject:[Dixielandjazz] Frances Faye's 100th
Let me hear that crazy cowbell! On this day in 1912 the irrepressible Frances Faye
was born in Brooklyn. Here's a live (audio only) medley of "An Occasional Man" and
"The Dummy Song" from New York in 1956, according to the caption. This doesn't sound
familiar; does anyone know the source?

And here she is on Australian TV in 1979, singing "I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My
Sister Kate" and then gabbing with the host:

Women will never be equal to men until they can walk down the street 
with a bald head and a beer gut, and still think they are sexy.
