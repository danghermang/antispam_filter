Eleven Post-doctoral Research Fellowships

The Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies is an internationally renowned research centre encompassing >200 researchers and graduate students, with ongoing research projects in 30 countries. We are seeking up to 11 early to mid-career postdoctoral Research Fellows with interests across a broad range of disciplines, including biology, geochemistry, mathematics, economics and social sciences. These are full time research-only positions, and successful applicants must have a PhD with exceptional track record for stage of career. Previous experience in coral reefs is not essential for most positions.

Four of the positions are associated with ARC Laureate Fellowships awarded for 2012-2017 to Professors Terry Hughes and Malcolm McCulloch. The positions will be based in Townsville or Perth. Appointees will have substantial freedom to forge a research program that suits her or his interests and abilities and to collaborate with leading coral reef researchers. Most of the appointments will be at Level A/B for 3 years (approximately A$71k-$94k per annum), although some may be more senior, with the potential for renewal. The following positions are available:

1.      Dynamics of complex systems - improve understanding of the two-way linkages between ecosystems and social change, and between shifts in climate and ecosystems.

(Townsville. Available now. Contact Terry.Hughes@jcu.edu.au<mailto:Terry.Hughes@jcu.edu.au>,)

2.      Mathematical modeling of ecosystems - threshold dynamics and regime shifts in ecosystems.

(Townsville. Available now. Contact Terry.Hughes@jcu.edu.au<mailto:Terry.Hughes@jcu.edu.au>)

3.      Policy Development, Institutions and Governance of Coral Reefs - social-ecological systems, their institutional dynamics, with a focus on multi-scale adaptive governance. (Townsville. Available now.  Contact Joshua.Cinner@jcu.edu.au<mailto:Joshua.Cinner@jcu.edu.au>)

4.      Ecosystems Goods and Services - quantify the linkages between the marketplace and dynamic ecosystems. (Townsville. Available now. Contact Louisa.Evans@jcu.edu.au<mailto:Louisa.Evans@jcu.edu.au>)

5.      Environmental history of coral reefs - reconstruct the environmental, social and economic history of catchments and coral reefs. (Townsville. Available now. Contact Terry.Hughes@jcu.edu.au<mailto:Terry.Hughes@jcu.edu.au>)

6.      AIMS. Joint research with the Australian Institute of Marine Science within four thematic areas (Townsville. Available now. Contact Jamie Oliver, J.Oliver@aims.gov.au<mailto:J.Oliver@aims.gov.au>)

7.      Pacific Island Coastal Fisheries - analyse constraints and opportunities in the provision of ecosystem goods and services and the role of community Based Resource Management in poverty reduction and development. Joint appointment with WorldFish (Available 1 March 2013. Contact David Mills, D..Mills@cgiar.org<mailto:D.Mills@cgiar.org>)

8.      Geochemical proxies of environmental change - utilize coral skeletons to determine long-term (centennial-scale) effects of climate and environmental changes on coral reefs. (Perth. Available 1 January 2013. Contact Malcolm.McCulloch@uwa.edu.au<mailto:Malcolm.McCulloch@uwa.edu.au>)

9.      Biomineralization and calcification- determine controls on the biomineralisation processes associated with coral calcification and the response of coral reef systems to climate change and ocean acidification. (Perth. Available 1 July 2013. Contact Malcolm.McCulloch@uwa.edu.au<mailto:Malcolm.McCulloch@uwa.edu.au>)

10.  Genomics - using genomics and transcriptomics to investigate aspects of coral biology ranging from calcification and disease to immunity and development. (Townsville. Available now. Contact David.Miller@jcu.edu.au<mailto:David.Miller@jcu.edu.au>)

11.  Conservation planning - developing a decision-making framework for management of Australian tropical islands. (Townsville. Available now. Contact Bob.Pressey@jcu.edu.au<mailto:Bob.Pressey@jcu.edu.au>)
