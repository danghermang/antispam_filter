Subject:Re: [child_lit] Looking for book suggestions
Good morning, Nance--

I highly recommend "Am=E9rica is Her Name" by Luis J. Rodriguez. It looks l=
ike a picture book, but don't let that fool you; the story is deep and will=
 resonate especially with Latinas who are migrants or immigrants. It's also=
 available in Spanish, "La Llaman Am=E9rica," and it's one of my favorites.
