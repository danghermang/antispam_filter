Prescribing Medication to End Life

Do you approve of a law summarized below, on which no vote was taken by the=
 Senate or the House of Representatives on or before May 1, 2012?

[http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/ele12/ballot_questions_12/quest_2.htm]
SUMMARY

As required by law, summaries are written by the State Attorney General, an=
d the statements describing the effect of a =93yes=94 or =93no=94 vote are =
written jointly by the State Attorney General and the Secretary of the Comm=
onwealth.

This proposed law would allow a physician licensed in Massachusetts to pres=
cribe medication, at a terminally ill patient=92s request, to end that pati=
ent=92s life. To qualify, a patient would have to be an adult resident who =
(1) is medically determined to be mentally capable of making and communicat=
ing health care decisions; (2) has been diagnosed by attending and consulti=
ng physicians as having an incurable, irreversible disease that will, withi=
n reasonable medical judgment, cause death within six months; and (3) volun=
tarily expresses a wish to die and has made an informed decision. The propo=
sed law states that the patient would ingest the medicine in order to cause=
 death in a humane and dignified manner.

The proposed law would require the patient, directly or through a person fa=
miliar with the patient=92s manner of communicating, to orally communicate =
to a physician on two occasions, 15 days apart, the patient=92s request for=
 the medication. At the time of the second request, the physician would hav=
e to offer the patient an opportunity to rescind the request. The patient w=
ould also have to sign a standard form, in the presence of two witnesses, o=
ne of whom is not a relative, a beneficiary of the patient=92s estate, or a=
n owner, operator, or employee of a health care facility where the patient =
receives treatment or lives.

The proposed law would require the attending physician to: (1) determine if=
 the patient is qualified; (2) inform the patient of his or her medical dia=
gnosis and prognosis, the potential risks and probable result of ingesting =
the medication, and the feasible alternatives, including comfort care, hosp=
ice care and pain control; (3) refer the patient to a consulting physician =
for a diagnosis and prognosis regarding the patient=92s disease, and confir=
mation in writing that the patient is capable, acting voluntarily, and maki=
ng an informed decision; (4) refer the patient for psychiatric or psycholog=
ical consultation if the physician believes the patient may have a disorder=
 causing impaired judgment; (5) recommend that the patient notify next of k=
in of the patient=92s intention; (6) recommend that the patient have anothe=
r person present when the patient ingests the medicine and to not take it i=
n a public place; (7) inform the patient that he or she may rescind the req=
uest at any time; (8) write the prescription when the requirements of the l=
aw are met, including verifying that the patient is making an informed deci=
sion; and (9) arrange for the medicine to be dispensed directly to the pati=
ent, or the patient=92s agent, but not by mail or courier.

The proposed law would make it punishable by imprisonment and/or fines, for=
 anyone to (1) coerce a patient to request medication,  (2) forge a request=
, or (3) conceal a rescission of a request. The proposed law would not auth=
orize ending a patient=92s life by lethal injection, active euthanasia, or =
mercy killing. The death certificate would list the underlying terminal dis=
ease as the cause of death.

Participation under the proposed law would be voluntary. An unwilling healt=
h care provider could prohibit or sanction another health care provider for=
 participating while on the premises of, or while acting as an employee of =
or contractor for, the unwilling provider.

The proposed law states that no person would be civilly or criminally liabl=
e or subject to professional discipline for actions that comply with the la=
w, including actions taken in good faith that substantially comply. It also=
 states that it should not be interpreted to lower the applicable standard =
of care for any health care provider.

A person=92s decision to make or rescind a request could not be restricted =
by will or contract made on or after January 1, 2013, and could not be cons=
idered in issuing, or setting the rates for, insurance policies or annuitie=
s. Also, the proposed law would require the  attending physician to report =
each case in which life-ending medication is dispensed to the state Departm=
ent of Public Health. The Department would provide public access to statist=
ical data compiled from the reports.

The proposed law states that if any of its parts was held invalid, the othe=
r parts would stay in effect.

WHAT YOUR	 VOTE WILL DO

A YES VOTE would enact the proposed law allowing a physician licensed in Ma=
ssachusetts to prescribe medication, at the request of a terminally-ill pat=
ient meeting certain conditions, to end that person=92s life.

A NO VOTE would make no change in existing laws.

ARGUMENTS

As provided by law, the 150-word arguments are written by proponents and op=
ponents of each question, and reflect their opinions. The Commonwealth of M=
assachusetts does not endorse these arguments, and does not certify the tru=
th or accuracy of any statement made in these arguments. The names of the i=
ndividuals and organizations who wrote each argument, and any written comme=
nts by others about each argument, are on file in the Office of the Secreta=
ry of the Commonwealth.

IN FAVOR: When my father was diagnosed with brain cancer, he had little tim=
e left. As his final days neared, he chose to use the Death with Dignity la=
w in his home state of Oregon. The Massachusetts version, like those in oth=
er states, will allow mentally competent adults with no chance to survive t=
heir illness to take life-ending medication prescribed by a physician.

My dad knew he wanted to die in the comfort of his own home; competent and =
aware instead of detached and sedated; on his own terms instead of those of=
 a fatal disease that had already taken too much.

My dad was already dying, but because of this law, he could say goodbye to =
those he loved, with dignity and grace in my mother=92s arms.

I urge you to vote =93Yes=94 because, while this choice isn=92t for everyon=
e, everyone has the right to this choice.

AGAINST: Question 2 restricts patients=92 choices and control by enabling s=
uicide as a substitute for quality health care. Question 2 is poorly writte=
n, confusing and lacks even the most basic safeguards. Patients would not b=
e required to see a psychiatrist before obtaining the lethal drug. Many pat=
ients with a treatable form of depression could get a life-ending prescript=
ion, rather than effective psychological care. Also, the proposal lacks any=
 public safety oversight after the fatal drug is obtained.

Question 2 does not require a consultation for palliative care, a compassio=
nate form of care that eliminates pain and maximizes quality of life for th=
e terminally ill. And, eligibility is based on a six-month life expectancy.=
 Doctors agree these estimates are often wrong. Individuals can outlive the=
ir prognosis by months or even years. Massachusetts should improve access t=
o quality health care for terminally ill patients, not access to suicide. V=
ote no on Question 2.
