But Graham, there won't BE any evidence. So you'll have to come off the fen=
ce and take sides. Tell us what you REALLY think!!=A0
=A0
The blokes in black may have been miked up but crucially, as we've already =
heard, they weren't recorded. So it'll be a question of their word against =
that of the relevant CFC players (Luiz/Ramirez).....
=A0
I know who I believe. And I also choose to believe that apart from all that=
,=A0the case against Clatts is a brilliantly conceived, masterfully execute=
d piece of opportunistic machiavellianism on the part of some as yet uniden=
tified genius on the CFC payroll. Who the fuck can it possibly be??????? Ro=
n Gourlay? Eddie Newton? Pat Nevin? Surely not.......
=A0
It must have taken, in the post-game super-charged emotionalism=A0of sunday=
, an EXCEPTIONALLY sharp, clear thinking brain to have evaluated the eviden=
ce, analysed all the potentail outcomes and, in the space of a couple of ho=
urs,=A0formulated this BRILLIANT plan to embarrass the FA/PL, hopefully ter=
minally.......
=A0
This is how I think we can reasonably assume it will play out. =

=A0
In the absence of any material evidence, and via the closing of=A0yellow/re=
d card waving ranks,=A0Clatts will be cleared by the FA. =

=A0
This will be the cue for CFC, riding=A0a very high horse,=A0to stake out it=
s position on the moral high=A0ground=A0and, in tones of outraged injury, d=
raw itself up to its full height and slot the ball neatly into the gaping n=
et thoughtfully=A0provided by an out-manoeuvred,=A0hoist-on-its-own-petard =
FA. In short, the gist of CFC's position will be "so, it's one rule for us =
and another rule for you is it......?"
=A0
In=A0the prevailing atmos of moral panic and witch hunt hysteria, mere accu=
sation, thanks to the spinelessness and vacuity of the FA's morally empty=
=A0position, has become the weapon of choice. =

=A0
As at Salem in the 1690s, so with McCarthy in the 1950s, mere accusation is=
 enough for=A0mud to stick. The FA, having set the ugly finger-pointing pre=
cedent with Terry/Ferdinand, can hardly now ignore the fallout from that pr=
ecedent without appearing=A0utterly hypocritical.=A0Mikel/Mata IS A. Ferdin=
and. Clatts IS Terry. We live in a world of proxies. Proxy outrage. Proxy g=
uilt. Let the FA live and more importantly die by its own sword.
=A0
Because the FA have actively encouraged the current moral hysteria with the=
ir readiness to convict known "toxic" individuals on the basis of probabili=
ty despite acquital in a court of law,=A0their self-petard-hoisting is pote=
ntially a THING OF BEAUTY TO BEHOLD.
=A0
Bearing all this in mind, Clatts IS finished, *actually* (or technically) g=
uilty or not.
=A0
Which, while unfortunate for him personally, nevertheless serves a higher p=
urpose - ie: the, hopefully terminal, blow to the FA's credibility.
=A0
That may sound harsh, but really it's hard to sympathise=A0with these atten=
tion seekers on any level=A0really, so the onion will stay firmly in the ha=
ndbag as far as most right thinking people are concerned. =

=A0
On the balance of probability, whatever he said, he probably thought he was=
 enjoying a bit of "banter" with Mikel/Mata which, in my view, and of cours=
e that of all right thinking people, makes it even fucking WORSE. The game =
has been all but ruined by the show boating egotism of these puffed up mart=
inets with their absurd hand gestures, self important strutting and vomit-i=
nducing games master bullying, ad-mixed with the even more nauseating spect=
acle of referee-on-player matiness. Yuk!!!
=A0
From this point onwards, who knows? The game has with the connivance of the=
 corporate media pretty much eaten itself anyway. Riven at every level with=
 phony "controversy" and=A0ramped up hysteria=A0and at every turn=A0hamstru=
ng by its own vacuous, impotent corporate responses to societal problems, i=
t is to all appearances terminally decadent. =

=A0
In a perfect world, this would all lead to a=A0root and branch cleansing of=
 the game and Year Zero restructure. Disband the PL, let the "big" clubs fr=
om all countries form a new Super Euro league and allow the grass roots to =
grow anew. Everything's cyclical - football may have reached another 25-30 =
year nadir - the gentrification, post Italia '90, of the game now thoroughl=
y played, and clapped, out. Let it bleed......

It's newsworthy because, so far, Romeu is the only player to have spoken pu=

He doesn't add much, except saying that Mata didn't hear the remark. =

It's possible there is a translation error, but what he said is presumably =
on tape because it was said to a Spanish radio station. =

No reason to get exercised. =

I don't know about you, but I don't have a clue what happened on the pitch.=
 Are the refs lying? Are the players lying? Is there a huge misunderstandin=

It's natural to want to rally behind "our" folk, but I don't want to see an=
