In general AC relays will have substantially lower coil impedance compared =
to DC.

There will also be a copper "cap" or slug around the top or bottom of the c=
oil. It's purpose is to hold the flux field long enough to keep the relay f=
rom chattering at the point where the AC crosses through zero.

As for using an AC relay on DC circuits, the lower coil resistance will mea=
n greater power consumption.

If the relay is driven be transistor logic, that can cause failure of the d=
river device.

If the relay has a capacitor involved in it's coil circuit to lengthen it's=
 pull-in, the lower resistance/greater consumption can result in negating t=
hat timing and cause a too short pulse or holdover.=20

When I need to replace a relay I look at the circuit and also test the coil=
 impedance of the relay being replaced (if possible).=A0 If there is no tim=
ing or solid state device driving it I'll simply select one as close in cur=
rent handling as practical.

Otherwise, keep as close to the existing coil's impedance as possible, goin=
g higher will usually be OK.

---and to further confuze things--other relay manufactures made both AC, an=

Also, they have been made/marked as 6, 8, 12, 24, 28, 30, 48, 50, 110, 117,=

The difference between the red and white relays is that the red ones have 2=

volt AC coils and the white/clear ones have 24 volt DC coils.=A0 If you che=

Newtjr:

I did encounter a bit of confusion with the relays in the junction box in=
=20
relation to the junction schematics in both the W2900 and W3300 manuals.

According to the schematic RY2 should be a dc/white relay. However, on the=
=20
junction itself this is a red ac relay.
I was advised that the red and white relays can sometimes be interchanged.

The relay sockets are painted ry2 and 6 are red. They work fine this way. T=
hey=20
should also be labelled on the junction. Else you can use the junction sche=
matic=20
to trace which of the round sockets go to which relays.
