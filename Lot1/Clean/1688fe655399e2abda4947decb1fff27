Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Capture Area
Dear Bill:

All the mails are very interesting. Someone, very theoric, and showing a ch=
ain of thinking. Others mails showing  practical answer.

Thank a lot to all people in the forum.

Thank Antennex!

Best regards.

Subject: Re: [Antenna-discussion] Capture Area

Hola Jose!

La primera pregunta de utilidad en la cadena!

The first useful question in the chain of comments.

I'm guessing that the answer may be in redundancy.

In any data stream, the noise is random, and the signal, if repetitious, is
not. Redundant signals add linearly. "True" noise adds as the root of the
sum of the squares. That gives about 3 dB of "gain" to the signal. Repeat
the redundant signal enough times and the signal "climbs" out of the noise.

Other comments welcome!

Subject: Re: [Antenna-discussion] Capture Area



I am pretty aware of the "effects/defects" of too much Q and little
bandwidth or too little Q and insufficient selectivity in the AM band.

What amazes me are those little WWVB synchronized wristwatches, which
uses miniature a ferrite "loopstick" and yet is able to receive WWVB and
get synchronized during the nights.

Here in Havana you can get as little as 15 dB SNR at noon or as much as
30 to 40 dB SNR at midnight, using a 31.5 meters long G5RV, which is a
"microscopic" dipole at  60 kHz. I have not tried other antennas which
might fare better.

How hign can be the Q in the case of the wristwatch, that has to detect
the rise and fall of the carrier modulated with the time code? Any other
measures of concentrated selectivity used? How much gain does the
receiver need to work properly?

It is tricky to synchronize clocks with such a simple code in the
presence of noise, and yet those little wristwatches seem to work
flawlessly.
For me, it is an intersting puzzle.

Jose, CO2JA
