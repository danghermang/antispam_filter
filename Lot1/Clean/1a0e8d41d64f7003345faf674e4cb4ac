Subject:[CT Birds] Quaker Ridge - Cave Swallow - pics
Hi All,

3 Cave Swallows just passed by Quaker Ridge - luckily I managed to get a few diagnostic - but not Nat Geo quality pics. First for the watch and much enjoyed by the gang. Pictures on my blog here: http://underclearskies.com/2012/11/14/cave-swallows-quaker-ridge-first/ Also today 15 WW Crossbill (yawn) and 3 Snow Buntings.
