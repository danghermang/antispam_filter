Subject:[CT Birds] Sooty/bridled type tern off Cornfield Point
Jake and Nick just called to say they finally found a storm driven bird, a Sooty/Bridled type tern off Cornfield Point around 4:30 p.m., so storm birds are finally entering the Sound.  I heard earlier from Patrick and Jim Dugan that they saw two Dovekies off Shippan Point, one at 2:40, and another at 3 p.m.  It begins... Stay safe and good luck tomorrow..
