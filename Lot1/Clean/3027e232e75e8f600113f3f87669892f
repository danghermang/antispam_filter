Hello Thomas:=0A=0A=0AI can give you some=A0answers that should help you:=
=0A=0A=0AHaving the # 544 amp in place of the #545 amp intended for the W28=

 normal for the TT motor to turn. =A0I'm not exactly sure which =0Amicroswi=

 24 volt AC =0Amotor, driven directly from a 24volt AC winding on a power t=
ransformer. This =0Atransformer is located on the amp chassis.=A0=A0=A0 Thi=
ngs that I'd check for are:=0A=0AIs the motor having a mechanical bind, cau=
sing it to stall out?=A0=A0 You mentioned =0Athat by turning the motor shaf=
t extension by hand, you can move the action of =0Athe lift arms and rotate=
 the record carrier.=A0 Does this turn freely or do you =0Ahave to force it=
?=A0=A0 If the motor's "load" is binding you'll need to determine =0Awhy.=
=0A=0AIf the motor shaft turns freely there's a loss of voltage or current =
getting to =0Athe motor. (voltmeter check)=A0 The transfer switch (one of t=

 if motor operation improves---red cover =0Arelays have 24 volt AC coils--w=

correct value fuses are installed.=A0=A0 Replace any "over size" =0Afuse va=

=0A=0AI bought an as-is 2810 jukwbox recently and need help sorting out som=
e issues.=0A=A0=0A=0AFirst of all, The unit has a 544 amp instead of the 54=
5 unit that book shows it =0Ashould have. It is my understanding that it sh=
ould wor though. Correct?=0A=A0=0A=0ASecond. When I turn the main power on,=
 the lights work amd when the micro switch =0Ato the left of the mute/play =
switches is depressed, the turntable motor runs. =0ARelease it by hand and =
the turntable motor stops. Nothing else, however, seems =0Ato cycle. =0A=0A=
=A0=0A=0AThird. Facing the back of machine, the right hand lift arm is in f=
ully up =0Aposition as if it is playing a record. The left hand lift arm is=
 partially up. =0AThe cam lobe on the mech is facing to back of machine. Ca=
nnot find a way to =0Aretarct the arms. If I turn the knob on bottom of mec=
h motor, the record rack =0Awants to turn...so I stopped turning until I ge=
t advice on how to retract arm. =0A=0A=A0=0A=0AFourth. The mech motor has p=
ower (you can feel it vibrate) as verified with =0Atester. It does not, how=
ever, seem to have enough power to turn/cycle the =0Amechanism=0A=A0=0A=0AL=
ast. There a one red wire dangling near the mute/play & micro switches> Can=
