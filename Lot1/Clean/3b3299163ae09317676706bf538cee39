Subject:[Birding-Aus] Computer ID of birds
Dear B-A,

Cornell Lab of Ornithology is developing a project called Merlin. This aim of this project is to develop software that enables computers to identify birds from images. See  http://dev.nabirds.org/Web/Tools/ImageUpload/pages/about.php

Given the advances in human biometrics, I imagine that computer ID of birds is quite doable. Wonder how long it will take for the technology to appear in handheld devices? After all, how many of us say, 10-15 years ago, would have thought that an all singing, all dancing field guide in a smartphone type device would be possible?

An interesting space to watch.

Cheers,

Carl Clifford
