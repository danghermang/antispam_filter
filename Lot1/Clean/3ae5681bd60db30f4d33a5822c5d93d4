Ok, I have not been following this thread, but if you want to inject audio =
into the power stage w/out a volume control plugged in:

The arms from the pot are the Red and Blue wires.

Pin 9 is Red. Pin 7 Blue.

Output from the preamp to pot:

Pin 6 Blk=A0=A0 Pin 8 White

Signal ground is Pin 1.

it should be fine to simply jump the out from the pre into the P.A. in, I d=
oubt the absence of the 25k/ohm load on the pre will have any meaningful ef=

You can ignore the contour taps if all you want is simple injection.These a=
