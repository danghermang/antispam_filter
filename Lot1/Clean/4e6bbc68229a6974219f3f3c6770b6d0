Tbh I find it hard to take it seriously when the word flawless is used abou=
t anyone.

I agree with Roald that giving away a free kick near the half way line shou=
ldn't be counted as being responsible for the Spurs goal, but in a flawless=
 game DL would have won the header cleanly or defended it differently

One can even quote the match report on TOCFCW:

"David Luiz was the culprit this time, initially gliding forward with the b=
all, but when he lost it to Rafael on halfway there was a big space for Man=
 U to exploit behind him, and they did so when Anderson found Hernandez jus=
t onside. The Mexican was not going to miss the opportunity to score in the=
 same net as his weekend winner. It was a highly frustrating way to end the=
 half."

But I concede that he may improve more and more by playing, and that maybe =
his frailties will gradually go away. And I accept that point of view that =
his positives outweigh his negatives, even if I don't quite share it. But w=
hen words like "flawless", and "faultless" are used about David Luiz, I fin=
d it very hard to take that seriously.
