This is what we figured out so far:

1500 came with polished walnut sides.=20
1550 was basically the same but was offered with a customized cabinet in =
textile leather in blue, blonde or mahagony.
Amps: model 516
Five fluorescent lamps were installed.

1500A and 1550A were built in 1953. They got a new cabinet style =
compared to 1500 and 1550.=20
1500A was offered polished walnut sides.
1550A came in blonde Textile leather or in custom colors blue or red.
Amps on these: model 520.
Only four fluorescent lamps were installed.

1500AF got a cabinet style like model 1500A ( polished walnut sides) and =
was set up for Hi-Fidelity: amplifier 520 plus aux. HiFi- amp 229.
