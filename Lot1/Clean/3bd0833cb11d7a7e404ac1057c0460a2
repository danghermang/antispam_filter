Subject:Re: [Chelsea] CPO Share Application Form
If Torres had scored when clean through just after the first goal, or passed to Ramires so he could score we may well have had an easier ride, and that summed up, again, what is wrong with him.

But remind me who it was who spotted the poor back-pas and closed down the goal-keeper so quickly that he forced him into the mistake for the first goal.

And maybe the keeper wouldn't have come out and made that header to Oscar if he hadn't thought that it might reach the run Torres was making behind the centre half. After all, he probably doesn't watch Torres enough to know how useless he is.

Well mine was pre player signatures!! It was presented on the pitch by SUPER Dan Petrescu though - half-time v Sp**rs too!

Wasn't around to enter the character assassination of David Luiz yesterday, but I don't think he had a bad game. Made several (not only
one) important (goal saving) blocks, some last ditch tackles and won the ball back in midfield on a few occasions. Not his best game but compared to poor Ryan Bertrand, who looked completely out of his depth, not helped by Hazard's failure to track back/help out or the useless Torres.
Contributed well against the best opponents we've faced this season.

With Texeira, Mkhitaryan & Srna all pulling onto our right flank, Bertrand was clearly targeted & failed miserably. I've always had faith he could cope against most but he certainly wasn't helped in what was an off-night for him (every player is allowed them, they are not robots or
FIFA 13 or whatever   !!).

Fernadinho was the most influential player by far in my opinion, not Willian, who did take his chances well & does looks a talent.
Fernandinho gave Ramires a tough time, winning most of the 50:50's and breaking up a lot of our attacking play. Helped by some dubious tactics (of several of their players) that was not punished by a laissez-faire ref...and no I didn't like his style of 'letting the game flow'. I fully favour, players being cautioned after play has broken down, not let them constantly get away with fouls because you've decided to play the advantage.

Did think it was a pen &, first hand, did not think that Mikel was offside. Ref seemed to lose interest after 60 mins & let everything go; though a curates egg of a performance because he didn't let Luis Adriano (or Srna) get away with their constant diving.

Hope that fortune continues to shine on us, we were so close to the ignominy of being the first Champions to get knocked-out in the group phase...just hope it doesn't happen because the press & opposition fans will have a field day with the 'We know what we are...' chant!
