Subject:[EVDL] Precharge / Discharge
Hello,

I recently built an OpenRevolt controller to replace my EV1 controller 
on my Jet ElectraVan.  I have no experience with precharge since the EV1 
has no input capacitors.  I have been doing a lot of reading on the 
archives of this list and elsewhere.  I have a good understanding of the 
precharge issue, but I haven't found any reference to the hazards of the 
controller retaining a charge on its capacitors after the vehicle is 
turned off.  It seems to me that there is a safety issue.

I did find a commercially available precharge device that addresses the 
issue.  However, it uses a different resistance for the precharge and 
discharge paths.  Why?

My thought is to use a relay to connect the precharge resistor when the 
ignition switch is on.  The OpenRevolt controller supplies a signal to 
enable the main contactor at a preset delay.   I was considering using a 
SPDP relay and the same resistor to both precharge and discharge the 
controller capacitors.  Am I mis-thinking?

Thanks,
Mike  --  Phoenix
