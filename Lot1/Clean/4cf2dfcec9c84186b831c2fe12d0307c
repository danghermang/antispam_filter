Subject:[edmug] Google analytics problem
Hi,=20
I'm now confused because if I google 'google-analytics.com' I get all sorts o=
f stuff about it being a virus or trojan. If I add 'mac' to the end if the s=
earch, there's virtually nothing. Is this mac malware or is it nothing? Is i=
t at server level but affecting the mac? (That seems unlikely to me). Why di=
dn't clamxav pick anything up? I'm running a full scan over night to see wha=
t comes up. Given ITs antipathy to macs I want to have things sorted in my o=
wn head so I can combat any hysteria/take the blame on the chin.
