Did you ever think you would hear a teenage Premier League footballer
use the phrase =91jumpers for goalposts?=92 Meet Chelsea=92s Josh McEachran.
That was his childhood growing up in Oxfordshire.

He was handed his first Chelsea strip by the club at the age of eight
and wore it every day in the family back garden, if he could be
bothered to get out of his school  uniform. Two versus two with his
three brothers, who can all play a bit and are all midfielders.

Josh, 19, is the oldest so teamed up with George, the youngest, now 12
=97 who has followed Josh=92s footsteps, and their parents Julie and
Mark=92s car journeys, to the Chelsea academy. Their opponents were
Billy, now 14, and second oldest Zak, 18, who was released by Chelsea
five years ago and now plays for Oxford City. Got that? Josh and
George v Billy and Zak.

=91We were lucky we had a good relationship with the neighbours and
they=92d always throw the ball back,=92 Josh said. =91It was all we did. Two
v two after school every day. As soon as we got in, we=92d chuck the
bags down and head out there. It was a small garden, no grass on it,
just mud, we=92d put down little jumpers for goalposts, get a proper
ball out and batter the fences.

=91It was really competitive. They are all good footballers and it
usually ended in a little row and we=92d sort it out the next night. My
grandad played semi-pro in Scotland and my dad only played locally but
he reckons he could play.  I think he thinks he is better than he was
but it=92s weird he has sons who are all pretty good.=92

Asked who is the best of the McEachrans, he gives it some thought,
blushes and smiles when he nominates himself. It is a rare moment of
bravado from a shy young man who is certainly not afraid to express
himself on a  football pitch.

Those who have seen him play will not be surprised that his skills
were honed in an enclosed backyard. He can also play a bit. He has
played in 22 Chelsea games since his debut in the Champions League
against MSK Zilina two years ago when he became the first player to be
born after the competition started (November 1992) to play in it.

But a loan spell at Swansea last season fell flat, despite his style
suiting Brendan Rodgers. He played five games in five months, three as
a substitute.

=91I went at a bad time,=92 he said. =91They wanted to stay up, they were
playing really well and Brendan didn=92t want to change the team so it
was tough to get in. Gylfi  Sigurdsson came in a week before me, he
was on fire from the start so he had to play. They did well and I
can=92t blame him.=92

Now on loan at Middlesbrough, he is a regular in their midfield,
playing a pivotal role in Tony Mowbray=92s typically free-flowing side,
who can go top of the Championship with a victory over Sheffield
Wednesday on Friday night.

McEachran is enjoying his time on Teesside. He lives at the luxurious
Rockcliffe Hall adjacent to the training ground, spending an ideal day
 off with his girlfriend, whom he mentions a lot, even though she is
supposed to be off limits. She is Coronation Street actress Brooke
Vincent, aka Sophie Webster.

It is the football I=92m interested in and McEachran believes the move
to the most northern Championship club is helping his development. It
is working for Middlesbrough, who are looking for their biggest crowd
for four years, despite the Sky cameras, after luring fans back with a
 half-price ticket offer. It helps that Mowbray=92s methods are working.

McEachran said: =91I could have gone to a few teams but I met Tony, got
on with him and his assistant Mark Venus, saw the training ground. I
know his style is to get the ball down, pass it through midfield, so
it was an easy choice. He drums it in every day in training. I am
playing games, which is what I came to do, and Middlesbrough are doing
well. The standard is good, really competitive, anyone can beat
anyone.

=91My body is getting used to it but I am feeling fitter than ever and
training is not as intense because of all the games.=92

McEachran is under constant review from Chelsea and he is in regular
contact with assistant first-team coach Steve Holland.

He has watched recordings of seen every Chelsea game. They could
recall him in January, so he wants to be primed for that. While
Middlesbrough is a happy temporary  location, he did not sign a
five-year contract last season for the sake  of it.

He said: =91I don=92t see Mata,  Hazard or Oscar in my position. It would
be good to play with those players, they are all on fire. I am a
deeper midfielder, so that=92s my favourite position, where Mikel,
Lampard or Ramires play.

=91I=92ve been there since I was seven and came through the youth system,
so that is my dream club. That is who I want to play for, but this
experience can only help me.=92
