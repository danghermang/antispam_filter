Subject:Re: [burners] OT: Serious political sh&t: Romneys buying voting
	machines
I also work in the computer security field, and I've done some work on elec=
tronic voting security (with NYU's Brennan Center and the LCCR, starting ba=
ck in 2004).

I can explain the details of how the hanging chad in Florida stole the 2000=
 election, courtesy of a very well known expert who I will not name because=
 he explained it in a private conversation and did not give me permission t=
o cite him publicly.=A0 It was a great job, plausible deniability and all.=
=A0 The result of this caper was the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) which was=
 ostensibly a pay-off to those disenfranchised by the fraud, but in reality=
 it was another opportunity to rip off taxpayers by selling shoddy goods to=
 government procurements.

There have been some horrendous problems with vote tallies from electronic =
voting systems reported in the past.=A0 It's not necessarily all malicious,=
 but there was a lot of money spent to buy machines with no funding for ens=
uring they are accurate and trustworthy.=A0 I've read HAVA, there's a secti=
on assigning certification testing responsibility but no money was ever att=
ached to the function although billions were spent on acquiring the systems.

There are a lot of other potential problems, opaque procedures around the s=
oftware running electronic voting systems is a big one.=A0 I'm still waitin=
g for somebody to discover that there are part of those systems developed o=
verseas....

It's a potential problem that could affect voters on any part of the politi=
cal spectrum., if whoever controls the voting machines gets to pick the win=
ner there's no way to ever displace the incumbents.=A0 Is that what we want=
 our country to become?

hi. i work in this field (computer security) with a strong interest in
things like fair elections.

years ago, i was talking to my mother - i mentioned that i was concerned
that there might be election fraud due to the diebold voting machines. she
said "that can't happen in america - we have bipartisan committees and
oversight and all sorts of things that prevent that kind of fraud. you're
just being paranoid. it would be all over the media if this happened."

do a google search for diebold voting machines - when the report was
released (a couple years later), nobody dared go as far as to say that the
election was rigged, just that it would have been *really* easy using those
machines. that there is more security legally required on slot machines
than voting machines. i'm an expert in my field, and would not be surprised
if the 2000 or 2004 elections were rigged.

there's a lot of conspiracy theory bullshit out there and a lot of reasons
to get pissed off, but when you immediately rail against someone for
spewing BS without doing any fact finding yourself, you're being just as
closed-minded. this was a serious issue with the diebold machines, and it
took years for the story to break in mainstream media outlets, so concerns
over bain buying up machines are, in my opinion, entirely legitimate.
enough to email the DOJ over something on a questionable website? maybe
not, but that doesn't mean the entire story is BS.
