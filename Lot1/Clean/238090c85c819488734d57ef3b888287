Subject:[meteorite-list] Ad - New Gift Offerings for the Holidays,
 Meteorites, Trinitite, Impactites, Amber, Fossils, and other Exotic Gifts
Hi Listees,

The holidays are fast approaching.  I created a new store category and
stocked it up with best-selling items for a variety of budgets.
Specimens from $5 to $500 are covered.  Meteorites, trinitite, and
amber make great gifts for the person who has everything.  As always,
you can use the coupon code "metlist" for 20% off your order.  In
addition, from now until Christmas, I will be offering a free rare
micro with each order - it might be a lunar, it might be a martian, it
might be an achondrite.  It certainly won't be an OC.  ;)
