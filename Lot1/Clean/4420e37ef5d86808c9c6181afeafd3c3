Subject:[Flexradio] 10 MHz input to FLEX-1500
I hooked up a 10 MHz source to my FLEX-1500 and my two 
DEMI transverters (L144-28HP and L432-28HP). I heard satellite
stations on both FO-29 and VO-52. But when I tried 
transmitting, I got no drive from the FLEX. After a lot of fiddling around. 
I noticed that if I used an 18" BNC jumper connected with a barrel to a 36" 
BNC jumper, the FLEX produced output, but with either jumper alone, I got 
nothing. Why?

I have the 10 MHz source (Trimble Thunderbolt) connected to a DEMI 10-4
amplifier/filter/4-way splitter. Without the DEMI splitter, I get drive from 
the FLEX. But with the splitter, I needed the two cables in series. Do you suppose I 
am getting too much 10 MHz signal from the splitter for the FLEX-1500? 
And the extra cable length gave me some attenuation?

Is the drive level of the 10 MHz signal to the FLEX-1500 critical?
