Hi Ben,


They were not BLM agents this time, just government employed "researchers" =
emboldened by the new laws governing meteorite hunting.=A0=A0 I will let th=
e hunters in the field relay first-hand what happened as their report shoul=
d be accurate.=A0 Hopefully they will provide some names so we know who to =
avoid.

All I have to say about Gold Basin and eBay is that any reviewer can cause =
problems for sellers by saying something was obtained on federal or state l=
and and quote these new BLM rules.=A0 I was also told directly, along with =
a hunting party, by a BLM agent from Needles, California that they do monit=
or eBay and websites for meteorites found on federal land.=A0 I will even g=
o as far as to state their is a snitch among us pretending to be helpful.=
=A0 He is well-known and pretends to be interested in the science although =
his actions dictate otherwise.=A0 I will not mention his name here on the L=
ist as it would create a huge controversy which this snitch involved our gr=
oup in before.=A0 He caused a major headache for us.


I have not had any problems with BLM agents here in Nevada although they ar=
e federal so they can cross state lines any time.=A0 The last one I ran int=
o was very helpful and was actually knowledgeable about collecting mineral =
samples, evening referencing his book for us.=A0 He did state that nothing =
collected on federal land could be used for commercial purposes without a p=
ermit.=A0 On the other hand, some BLM agents from California seem to make u=
p their own rules as they certainly are not listed in book or website that =
I have ever seen.


Happy hunting,

Adam

Hi Adam,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 That is kind of creepy, do you mean the BLM (govt servants)=
=A0 are harassing private citizens to keep them from legally hunting?=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Also, in an earlier post of yours, you said you had already=
 been hassled over gold basin material,=A0 what happened?=A0 I have found m=
eteorites from Holbrook, Franconia, Gold Basin, and Red Lake, and although =
I'm not a commercial dealer or professional hunter, I've always had the com=
fort of knowing that in later years, I could always sell some of my finds i=
f I wanted, or needed to.=A0 Since at least for now, all of my finds, are p=
re-Sept. 2012, (before the new rules) shouldn't I be able to sell them in t=
he future?=A0 Am I going to be harrassed by the BLM or others if I do?=A0 P=
lease let me know what is going on.

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 On a more pleasant note, we're having Thanksgiving with rel=
atives in Vegas=A0and I'm taking that week off.=A0 I'm going to drive up an=
d do some day-hunting in the desert for a few days before my wife flies up.=
=A0 How are the BLM people in=A0area near the border with California?=A0=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
