Here are a few of my favorites:

The Tiger Rising, by Kate DiCamillo
Becoming Naomi Leon, by Pam Munoz Ryan
The Alice Series, by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor--this is a beautifully done, poignant, funny, serious series of 25 books that begins with Starting with Alice, when Alice McKinley is in about 3rd grade and living in the aftermath of her mother's death. The books mature with Alice.

Hello everyone-



I've been a list member for a number of years and always find everyone's
contributions so helpful.  So, I am reaching out to all of you.  I am on
the board of directors for the National Alliance for Grieving Children (
http://childrengrieve.org/).  NAGC provides a network for nationwide
communication between hundreds of children's bereavement support
professionals and volunteers who want to share ideas, information and
resources to support the families they serve in their own communities. We
also promote national awareness to enhance public sensitivity to the issues
impacting grieving children and teens.  In 2008, Children's Grief Awareness
Day was instituted and this November it will on November 15, 2012.



We need your help.  We would like to build a "library" of relevant and
helpful books on our website and would like your suggestions for books
featuring children and teens who have experienced a loss and are grieving,
or books with themes of death, healing and resilience.  We are looking for
books appropriate for all ages, picture books, chapter, YA.
