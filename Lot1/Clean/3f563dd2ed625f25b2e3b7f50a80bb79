I think its probably a lack of opensource and or cheap tools that is
the issue. gmsh and getdp are fantastical powerful but hard to use and
i've seen very little else that is a complete tool.

The tools i use all have there own system for drawing models or can
accept standard autodesk files. The other tools tend to use solidworks
and/or flavors of 3d autocad things all of which are extreme amounts
of money. I think the full 3D version of magnetics fea that we were
looking at was between =A310k and =A320k depending on what solvers we had.
