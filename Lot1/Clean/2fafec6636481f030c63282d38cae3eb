Subject:Re: [EVDL] Calb battery issue


Yes, several cm (dm?) of a good insulation is probably always needed in Eur=
ope.
and we must always have a heater with the use of todays Li-cells, as I see =
it.  =

Just to keep them above +15 degrees so they perform decent,
or at least 0 degrees, to survive the charging and regen.. =


Another "must have" on my Lithium list: =

Active forced cooling needed in the summer for all hard driving and if char=
ging needed several times a day. or fast.
and the BMS must know most of the cells temperatures please.
I would prefere to monitor all of them.

Thunderskys rise in temperature was dramatical at 2 and 3C discharging and =
charging from + 10 degrees C.
 Even at slow 1C it was not good for them.
I would say... please use 0.1-0.3C charge and 0.3-1C discharges..  =

I really beleve that any over-heat in the middle of a big cell will kill th=
em much faster. =


Yes They do promote very high C-rates, but that is marketing..  =

Just plot your celll temp and voltage at a 3C discharge + 1C charge + 3C di=
scharge again + an over-night 0.2C.  =

 =

You will probably not see the promoted cyckle life if you go any higher tha=
n 0.2C Charge and 0.5C discharge, or have your cells above 25-30=B4Celcius =


we also need to have a good circulation inside the packs, all the cells nee=
d to bee at the same temp..

The outdoor air temp for Summer/winter variations is probably about 70=B4C,=
 worst cases in north Sweden. =

And about +/-60=B4C is a normal max/min variation in Air temp here in the m=
iddle of Sweden. =


Also add upp a bit extra on top of that for hot sunny days at a parking lot=
?  =

(if it is +30=B4C in the normal stand still air, I think + 80=B4C inside a =
sunny car is possible. But not in the battery box)  =


So the initial cost will increase a bit extra for LiFePO4, with a high perf=
ormance IP-68 low energy "house"  :-)
