Subject:[burners] OT - Voter suppression- focus on 'in person' fraud which
	is non virtually non existent,
	ignore absentee ballot fraud which is real
One guess as to which party tends to get the most support from absentee ballots.  Therefor nothing is said about it being vulnerable to fraud, which apparently does happen. 
In person voter fraud, the reason for many new state 'Voter ID' laws, every one newly emerging from a Republican majority state legislature and Governor? That in response to-now this is really twisted-a mere 10 prosecuted voter fraud cases in the past 12 years? 

Still, could happen in large numbers, some time in the future, right? So to make sure only legitimate voters can cast their ballot, just show some valid ID. Reasonable, is it not? Ah, but then there are the little details that show what is really going on...

College ID? Not acceptable as proof of eligibility, sorry. 

N.R.A. membership card? Go right ahead and cast your vote.

 Again, guess which political party tends to benefit most from young voters, and which from 'I want guns ownership unrestricted by any safety rules whatsoever' issue voters? Even driver's license based ID is problematic, as poor and minority voters often lack one- who would have thought of that?

Why not have voting on a weekend, or make it a national holiday- so everyone can have a chance to vote, regardless of lack of transportation, or time off from work,  etc- Then lots of volunteers could be at polling stations to make sure there is no fraud. How about that, Republicans?
Opps, if full voter turnout, Democrats would almost always win.

Now, as for allocation of polling machines, make sure the suburbs have all they need, even if the waiting line at urban stations stretches into hours. Again, the political demographics of urban vs suburban and rural and political affiliation tell the story.
