Subject:[Birding-Aus] Little Egret feet colour
  Yesterday I  photographed a Little Egret in beautiful breeding plumage 
at Point Cook Coastal Park.  I have uploaded two photos to the Birdlife 
Photo gallery site (look up via Birdlife and former BOCA site).  The 
picture of the bird with one foot raised shows some pale colour on the 
soles of the toes - I wouldn't really call it yellow.

   This time last year I photographed a non-breeding Little Egret at 
Lotus-Bird Lodge, on Cape York.  It has yellow soles and a yellow streak 
right up the inside of the leg, running up above the leg-joint (heel or 
hock).
