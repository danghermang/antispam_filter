Philip, these are observations from people who are constantly looking for m=
igrants all along the western coast of Japan during the whole of the spring=
 and autumn migration seasons. They are searching the areas below lighthous=
es, small offshore islands, etc. and notice that on days following a full m=
oon, there are many more migrants to be found in the mornings at such landi=
ng spots - birds that are usually exhausted from flying all night. Therefor=
e, these observations seem a lot more accurate than a survey method that tr=
ies to spot birds as they are flying in the night sky.
