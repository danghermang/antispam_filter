Why you need an interactive archive
Real-world benefits from Taylor Wessing
1pm GMT / 2pm CET / 8am Eastern, December 6, 2012

Hi Braun As,

Most businesses need archives of their files and emails that
their employees can reach with ease. But certainly, it's of more
strategic importance for some than others.

Reg reader Stuart Walters, falls into the latter camp. He's the
IT Director of international law firm Taylor Wessing - a place
where archiving is never an after thought.

On the 6th of December Stuart is in our studio to tell us how he
built his interactive archive and the benefit he and the firm get
from it.

He'll be joined by The Register's own Tim Phillips, Tony Lock from
analysts Freeform Dynamics and Orlando Scott-Cowley from Mimecast.
Between the four of them they'll be running through Stuart's project
and looking more broadly at how you solve archiving challenges,
including actually getting these projects funded.

If that sounds like your bag you can join us from the comfort of
your own desk by registering, for free, right here.=20
