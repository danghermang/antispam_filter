Thanks ;=A0 good points.

ARTE [ an acronym, by the way ] is regularly available on ( at
least some of the ) cable services here in this country, such as the
one to which I subscribe -- as well as in a few other European
countries, and in Israel, and at least some of the programs are
made available even elsewhere.

Anyone really interested will find that there exist fairly extensive
Wikipedia articles on ARTE in French and German, and shorter
ones in English and more than twenty-five other languages.
