Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Alan,

Only you have been talking about the EFFICIENCY of ferrite transmitters. =

I agree that it is more relevant for transmitting antennas than the rest of =

us have acknowledged in this thread -- which has been about receiving =

antennas.

However, I use your numbers below to illustrate a different point.

The ratio of the (inductive) reactance with/without the ferrite (and withou=
t =

the tuning capacitor) is 700/14 =3D 50
according to your numbers.

The ratio of the radiation resistance Rrad with/without the ferrite is
1e-8/4e-12 =3D 2500 =3D 50^2

The open-circuit voltage Voc is proportional flux thru the coil, which is =

proportional to the inductance, which equals the (inductive) reactance, so =

this ratio with/without the ferrite is also 50.  [A delicacy is that Voc is =

to be measured without the tuning capacitor; it is the voltage between the =

antenna terminals when nothing is connected to them, neither tuning =

capacitor nor load.]

The received power (of a tuned antenna)  is Voc^2 / Rrad, which is the SAME =

with/without the ferrite (to the extent that losses can be ignored.   Since =

losses are greater with the ferrite present, the received power is actually =

somewhat less with the ferrite than without.)

The capture area is proportional to the received power, so the tuned captur=
e =

area is the SAME with/without the ferrite (and LESS with the ferrite if you =

take losses into account).   [You can always make the capture area very low =

by detuning the antenna, but this is of little interest.]

---------------------------
The ferrite serves as a cheap voltage amplifier, boosting Voc by 50.   This =

is what matters for the cheap receiver circuit, which involves a further =

voltage amplifier.   The received power is not important for an antenna =

connected to a voltage amplifier.

As you have often noted, power/energy efficiency does not matter for the =

receiving antenna -- for which the voltage is what matters.    So, ferrites =

can help here (especially at lower frequencies).

Energy losses in the ferrite affect the voltage at the receiving antenna =

terminals only indirectly.   In the frequency regime where losses in the =

ferrite are high, the atomic magnetic moments in the ferrite have reduced =

ability to flip, and the effective permeability of the ferrite is reduced. =

The latter reduction translates into reduced voltage.   But this reduced =

voltage is not "caused" by the losses in a simple way; it is perhaps better =

to say that it is "associated" with the losses.

In contrast, as you have often noted, power efficiency does matter when =

considering a transmitter, and adding a ferrite, which adds losses, is not =

such a good thing to do.

Cellphones, which must both receive and transmit (and which operate at high =

frequencies) do not have ferrite antennas.

Hi

The main point to remember about ferrite antennas is the losses, which
are high.  For that reason this kind of antenna is most used below 1.6
MHz for receiving, in systems where there is plenty of field strength.
I thought it might be useful to jump ahead to see what to expect from
a typical ferrite-rod antenna.

For a typical ferrite rod antenna of 100x10 mm wound with 10 turns at
1 MHz the following parameters apply in round numbers (Alan Payne's
figures might differ, he said by about 10 dB):

Radiation resistance:  1E-8 ohms,
Reactance: 700 ohms,
Tuning capacitor: 200 pF
Loss resistance (assuming a tuned Q of 100): 7 ohms
Radiation efficiency: with tuning 1E-9, without tuning 1E-11.

We can now take away the ferrite, leaving the coil, and the parameters
are obviously different:
Radiation resistance: 4E-12,
Reactance: 14 ohms,
Tuning capacitor: 10,000 pF
Loss resistance (assuming a tuned Q of 200): 0.07 ohms
Radiation efficiency: with tuning 2E-11, without tuning 2E-13.

These numbers might seem strange, but they show that the presence of
the ferrite improves the radiation efficiency.  But it only improves
it from impossible to extremely bad :)  If there is any interest in
how these figures are derived, we can discuss them.  This level of
performance is all right for a transistor radio, by the way.

I might have made some errors in the numbers, but these are put up as
a starting point and I don't mind sticking my neck out in the
interests of science :).
