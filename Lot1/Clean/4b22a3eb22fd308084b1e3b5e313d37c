Subject:[Jukebox-list] Wire for 1939 Mills Zephyr jukebox
I have a lot of my wiring in my old Zephyr that is in really bad shape.  =
How do I determine what type of wire to replace it with?  What is the =
best source for new wire?  If I don=E2=80=99t mind using modern wire is =
that okay and how would I determine what gauge to use for each wire?  If =
I want it to look period and use cloth covered wire where is the best =
source?

Would it hurt if I use a larger gauge on a wire that is smaller gauge =
right now?

Thanks.

Peter Brown
