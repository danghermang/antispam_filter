Subject:[Koha] Global Bug Squashing Weekend starts Friday!
It was decided at the IRC general meeting yesterday that this weekend
would be a Global Bug Squashing weekend, starting Friday November 9th
and running through Monday November 12 in whatever time zone you
choose.

Not sure how you can help? Jump on the IRC channel (
http://koha-community.org/get-involved/irc/ ) and we will help you get
 started! And with the sandboxes provided by BibLibre all you need in
 order to join the fun is a web browser!

To those submitting patches, I ask again that every patch come with a
test plan outlining:

1. What the problem is.
 2. How to reproduce the problem.
 3. What the patch does to solve the problem.
 4. What (if any) configuration steps need to be taken after the patch
 is applied.
 5. What steps to take to test that the patch is working correctly.

And finally, even if you can't submit a patch or test a patch you can
simply TEST! Kick Koha's tires and see if you can break something!
