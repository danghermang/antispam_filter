Subject:Re: [child_lit] Critical term
I agree wholeheartedly with the others admiring Jameela's rhetorical
knowledge, and add:

Why not create a term yourself that suits your purposes? I'm not a huge fan
of people coining terms all over the place (often because they do it for no
really good reason), but in this case it seems there's a genuine lack of
terminology - you're talking about nature AS character in what seems to be
a  fairly literal way, and both personification and pathetic fallacy seem
far more figurative. If Nature (or nature) is actually a true character,
then it's not a thing personified, or a thing with attributes given to it
by the reader/author - it's a legitimate character, not a metaphor. [the
closest comparisons I can come up with are the Green Wind (et.al) in The
Girl who circumvaigated fairyland... and Death, our narrator of The Book
Thief - both of which are represented as actual people, I think, not as
metaphor. Calcifer, too, maybe, from Howl's Moving Castle, since he's a
fire (fire-demon)].

I have no suggestions for what to call this kind of character, of course,
but I don't think you'd be doing anyone a disservice if you created your
own term for it.
