Subject:[meteorite-list] AD: 98.7g oriented  NWA for sale (flying saucer)
Hi List,

I have a beautiful example of an oriented meteorite for sale:
A 98.7g unclassified NWA,  flat "flying saucer" shaped, relatively fresh
stone, with a roll-over rim around the edge at the back.

This ordinary chondrite has a magnetic susceptibility logX value of 5.27, an
indication for a H-type chondrite.

The meteorite will go to the highest reasonable offer within the next two
days.

Thanks, and have a nice weekend!
