Subject:[Dixielandjazz] Medford Jazz Festival Test Snippet
Dixie Digesters,

Frank Grace pointed me toward this "listserv" and asked that I write 
something about our early October festival. That submission will come 
shortly, but I wanted to make sure I understand the submission protocol 
first. Computers, in this regard, just don't appreciate improvisation.

Regards from the left coast.
