Subject:[CT Birds] Quaker Ridge - 8 species warbler etc
Hi All,

It felt like a noteworthy warbler day for late in October inland here at Quaker. Warblers: 1 Orange-crowned, 1 Nashville, 1 Northern Parula, 1 Black-throated Blue, 2 Common Yellowthroats, 1 Pine and obviously many Palms and Yellow-rumped.

A nice mix of raptors on the day shared with Queens County Bird Club, and it was nice to see some old friends as well as meet some new ones. Highlight raptor wise was not a species but rather 5 Bald Eagles playing and kettling together just North of the watch before they eventually streamed west.

ps I heard from Joe Bear that the Clay-colored remained at Allen's today (putting on a good show) along with Lincoln's Sparrow (found by Mardi and Towny) and multitudes of White-crowned - can't remember if he mentioned Vesper.
