Dear Sarah

Having a video on u-tube of scientists unnecessarily touching wild
animals is in a nutshell "against the grain". Hence I really hope that
you will please remove because your arguments below do not make this
action right.

Best wishes

Julie

> Dear Martin and Stacy,Thank your for your comments.
> I have been working with endangered marine wildlife since 1992. As such, =
I'm aware of the perils of people interacting with wild animals, and cases =
where ecotourism can go terribly wrong. In the case of goliath groupers, we=
 have a conundrum on whether we can accept a minor disturbance as an altern=
ative to death. Since death is rather terminal, it seems the only logical a=
ction is to minimize negative effects from ecotourism.
> Perhaps the best way to resolve your concerns will be to take you scuba d=
iving with the goliath groupers. Goliaths are extremely curious and unafrai=
d of divers. This inquisitive behavior has been documented by many scientis=
ts.. In fact, it's been a major factor in increasing their vulnerability to=
 extinction, as the goliaths become easy targets for spearfishers.
> Injury by a goliath grouper might occur when a diver attempts to feed the=
m. This was not the case here. None of the scuba divers portrayed in the vi=
deo fed the groupers. The divers did not chase after the groupers. The goli=
aths approached us on their own.
> We did not interrupt spawning activity on this night. There were no gravi=
d females, and there was a lack of courtship and courtship coloration indic=
ating pre-spawning behavior. And no aggression resulted from our activities=
... You can see in the video, goliaths waiting right by the divers, and sta=
ying there, with no signs of stress.
> The video was produced by an independent filmmaker, who has the freedom t=
o post his videos in you tube.
> Your concerns are important, but that's no reason to portray me as an irr=
esponsible scientist. In youtube, you can also find many videos of fishers =
who capture goliath groupers and land them on the deck of the boat, for the=
ir own pleasure and to take pictures. All the time the goliaths are fightin=
g in the line and the time spent out of the water, the fish are suffering t=
remendous stress and being slowly asphyxiated. Not to mention that these fi=
shers are violating the "possession" terms of the current federal and state=
 moratorium on goliath grouper harvest. Perhaps you can also share your con=
cerns with the authors of every single youtube video where such violation i=
s portrayed.
> Now, let's consider what is more stressful for the goliath groupers: to h=
ave a group of experienced divers not chasing you, but waiting for you to a=
pproach them, or to be hooked, fight for your life, get landed on the deck =
of a boat and slowly asphyxiate until someone remembers to release you back=
 in to the ocean.
