I have now built and uploaded some packages, which I would be
very grateful to have some testing feedback for.  They are
at:

  http://people.debian.org/~rleigh/schroot-squeeze-backport/
  http://people.debian.org/~rleigh/schroot-squeeze-backport/schroot_1.6.4-3~bpo60+1.dsc
  http://people.debian.org/~rleigh/schroot-squeeze-backport/schroot_1.6.4-3~bpo60+1_amd64.build

(sources + amd64 binaries)

This is 1.6.4-3 from unstable; no source changes.

This will obviously need to wait until it's entered testing
before it can be uploaded.


Regards,
Roger
