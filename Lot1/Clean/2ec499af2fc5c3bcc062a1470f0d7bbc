Yes we won the CL but don't you think the club did intend to get rid of
some of these players? Don't you agree there was a lot of luck involved in
winning the CL? A nice book to read would be "Fooled by Randomness" written
by Nassim Taleb and then watch our CL campaign again. For me, we were very
lucky to win it. Alex and Anelka did not win us the CL for a start, Drogba
was always going to leave at the end of the season and how much longer is
Lampard going to play? Already he is no longer guaranteed a start.
