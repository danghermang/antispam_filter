Subject:[bcp] Friday road conditions on the Wayne < > Chadds Ford ride





Dear Friends,
=A0
Road conditions today were safe for cycling on the Wayne < > Chadds Ford Fr=
iday Frolic ride, using this route: http://ridewithgps.com/routes/1846480.=
=A0 Some of the roads did have a layer of compressed leaves on the shoulder=
s, but the roads were dry.

There were no road closures or detours on our ride, but there were a few cl=
osures in the area, on other roads peripheral to our route:
=A0

In Wayne, Croton Rd between Radnor Rd and Dewitt was closed, due to a falle=
n tree.
In Malvern, Line Rd was closed north of Dutton Mill (heading toward Boot Rd=
 & Paoli Pike)
At the intersection of=A0Darby Paoli=A0Rd/PA-252 and White Horse Rd (this i=
s a 3-way or "T"), the traffic lights were not functional.=A0 A temporary s=
top sign was placed there.
=A0
This is not hurricane-related, but.....White Horse Rd between Darby Paoli/2=
52 and the curve at Wayland Rd is currently being MILLED.=A0 A large, orang=
e, "Rough Surface" sign has been posted.=A0 The milling was not that severe=
 for thin tires.
=A0
In Chadds Ford, we passed a large downed wire in the shoulder of Brinton's =
Bridge Rd, a couple of miles after turning onto Brinton's Bridge from Creek=
 Rd/PA-100.
=A0
For the Halloween lovers: on West Wayne Ave, we passed large, single home a=
cross from Odorisio Park with a full-tilt, colorful, haunted Halloween disp=
lay on the front lawn.=A0 This is west of Conestoga Rd.
=A0
Take care,
