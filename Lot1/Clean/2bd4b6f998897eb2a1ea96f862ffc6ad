Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Well .......
Ok, I was just about to post that article as an example of lack of
observation, irony and outright error.

It starts out in the same facile way that MotD2 did, attempting to
blame his hair for being noticed more. MotD2 got rightly thrashed for
that nonsense - not so here for some reason?

Cahill got turned in spite of being in good position because RvP is
rather good - a detail that seems to have slipped his mind. He'd have
been beaten far easier if, like Luiz, he'd dived in and lost himself,
which didn't happen.

Luiz was part of the recovery against Napoli in the 2nd leg, though
apparently JT's reappearance wasn't a factor, nor mention of Luiz's
catastrophic error in the 1st leg that led directly to conceding.

A brave performance in the CL final certainly, in which he was injured
almost throughout, deserves credit for including precisely zero of all
the things he normally does, combined with a net of midfielders and
forwards in defensive positions.

He claims Mazacar (as Mata, Hazard and Oscar are becoming known)
depend on a centre back going forward, whereas it's plain to anyone
with eyes in their head that either Oscar is playing from one of the
two pivot positions or Mata is coming deep and collecting the ball
himself.

The only point Hansen was correct on was that Luiz stopped trying
toward the end of the Sunday match - he certainly got lazy, though it
would be more correct to point out he was moved out of defense
entirely in that period of play. It didn't help as he seemed intent to
pass to the opposition more than to his team-mates.

The sentence "It=92s not acceptable to easily relinquish the ball and
empower the opposition to build an attack from a throw-in or a corner"
as a criticism of the alternative beggars belief when it was precisely
his error from a throw-in in Donetsk that led to their opening goal.

And somehow the article omits mention of his hollywood passing which
is on a par with Steven Gerrard's. That is, half end up in the crowd.

For an article defending the manner in which Luiz plays, almost every
single paragraph was comedic in its outright stupidity. With friends
like Lukey Moore, he doesn't need enemies.
