The signings I consider good are those he has made at Spurs. Vertonghen,
Dempsey, Dembele, Lloris (although we ain't seen much of him but a big
reputation).

Did AVB make any signings at Chelsea? I am not sure. Our transfer process
is unclear. Are Hazard, Azpilicueta, Marin, Oscar etc etc RDM's signings? I
don't think so, but neither do I know who is responsible at CFC. Is it
possible AVB may have suggested some of these players?

If AVB did sign Mata, good decision! He has been brilliant for us. Do you
really doubt that if AVB had more players of similar quality signed by
himself and thus loyal to him and prepared to work with his ideas that we
would have become a lot better as the team became his, rather than having
to work with the lot who said "we don't like this fucker so we ain't going
to play for him".

Finally, how much of the "management through fear" was Roman inspired? Was
he given a remit to clear out some "dead wood"? Don't forget people like
Luiz, Meireles, Ramires supported him and were happy to play for him.
