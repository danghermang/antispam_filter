Subject:[bcp] Conshy Nights Lights is Thursday next week
Hey fellow Conshy riders!

We had a great turn-out for last night's ride due to the mild temps,
including a several riders new to the night time experience.

*Next Wednesday is Halloween.*  In order to avoid all the ghosts and
goblins on the SRT and be home for our trick-or-treaters (not to mention
any heightened activity in Manayunk), *we are moving the ride to Thursday
night.* Also a plus is that the remnants of Sandy should be gone by then.

Hope you can make it.

Steve Muth
