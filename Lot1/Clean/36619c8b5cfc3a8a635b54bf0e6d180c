Subject:[Birding-Aus] Southern Emu-wren at Evans Head
I had nice views this week of Southern Emu-wren in the heath at Evans Head,
in northern NSW. This had been the most northerly site for this species
until it was found several hundred kilometres north at Cooloola in
Queensland.

 

To my knowledge, despite plenty of suitable habitat, it has not been found
anywhere between Evans Head and Cooloola. I'd like to hear from anyone who
thinks otherwise.
