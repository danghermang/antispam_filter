Subject:[Chelsea] Piano Marathon/Non CFC
As many of you may be aware, I'm a musician and play piano.  In fact, 
I'll be performing a 24 hour marathon to benefit St. Joseph's Hospital, 
a medical facility primarily designed to help the less fortunate.

If you'd like to find out a little more about the event please visit the 
event website:

I'm as passionate about music as I am Chelsea Football club, so I 
suppose this post isn't specifically non-Chelsea.  Either way, I 
sincerely hope I survive this musical ordeal.  Actually, I believe it's 
going to be a lot of fun, so if you find yourself in the Phoenix area on 
January 26th, 2013, please make sure you drop in and say hello.  I take 
requests :-)
