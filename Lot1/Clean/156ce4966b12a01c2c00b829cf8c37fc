Subject:[Koha] rebuild_zebra: Biblios aren't displayed anymore
Hi all

Since I have done a rebuild of the zebra index with

/usr/share/koha/bin/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -a -r

the biblios and items aren't displayed anymore with the search results.

You can try it at http://bibliothek.ksobwalden.ch/ using for instancs
the author Thomas Mann. The result shows 7 hints (witch is likely the
number of Thomas Mann as an author or co-author).

But alle the seven hints are marked with "Kein Titel"

If I use the inventory tool then the biblios are shown an I can even
edit them.

/var/log/koha/koha-opac-error.log shows some errors like:
[Mon Oct 22 14:43:23 2012] [error] [client 180.76.5.146] [Mon Oct 22
14:43:23 2012] opac-detail.pl: Use of uninitialized value in
concatenation (.) or string at
/usr/share/koha/opac/htdocs/opac-tmpl/prog/en/modules/opac-detail.tt
line 746.

What's wrong?


It's Koha 3.08.05 with Perl 5.010001 Zebra 2.0.52 on debian squeeze.
