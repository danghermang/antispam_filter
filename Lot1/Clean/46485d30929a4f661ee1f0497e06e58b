More by accident than design. At least initially.

There is lots of malware out there for Linux - rootkits have been adapted 
from other *nix platforms to run on Linux. If you can persuade a web 
server to run an arbitary program then you can get in. (e.g. many older 
versions of some big packages have vulnerabilities that allow uploading of 
php code which can then be executed - and you don't always need root to be 
able to do things like send spam or access local databases...)

This is true. But... Maybe you ought to say 'desktop users' here. Linux 
probably outnumbers most things now - by virtue of it being what powers 
android.

Yet.

Not true. Some rootkits get in that way.

What's really neded is more education. That's the key - even for Win PCs, 
with the knowledge to stop your computer auto-execiting stuff in email, on 
erb pages, etc. you can do a lot for yourself even before the virus 
scanners check things.

It's only a matter of time before the criminals start to target Linux with 
more gusto than they currently do.
