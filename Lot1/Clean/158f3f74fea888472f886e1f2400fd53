Subject:[CT Birds] Stratford Point severely damaged - photos
I thought it would be of interest to many of you to see dozens of before,
during, and after photos of Stratford Point and it's coastal dune, the
year-old erosion control structure, revetment wall and more here on the CAS
blog:

It also has a lot of background information on the property and links to
posts about the projects that have been conducted there in the last couple
of years. Connecticut Ornithological Association is one of several groups
that have contributed to help restore the vitally important coastal habitat
at the site. While some extensive and costly repairs will be necessary, the
future is still very bright. Let's hope we can avoid any more tropical
cyclones for a few decades instead of back-to-back years.
