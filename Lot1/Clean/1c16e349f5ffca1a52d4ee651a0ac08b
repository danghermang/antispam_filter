Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Clattenberg stands firm
I read this too; apparently he feels that Torres took an extra stride after

the contact before falling and that is simulation as far as he's

concerned. So Mr Torres please remember as soon as you feel a touch drop

like a stone as you'll get a foul then - hang on wasn't that what Drogba

was berated for doing?   I do so hope CFC can make that complaint about his
'inappropriate' language stick. PeterM

I know some purists may not like this but it getting to the point where we
need some technology intervention since the referees and their assistants
need some help.   It seems to me that as the game has progressed withfaster
and more skillful with players predisposed to use every nuance to gain an
advantage at the expense of their opponents.  With respect to the Torres
incident or the Liverpool disallowed third goal it would take a fifth
official in radio contact to alert the officials as to what really happened.
By the time Crappenburgh walks to the scene of the foul he could be
informed exactly what happened because clearly he could not have seen what
actually happened.  I know there is this talk of swings and roundabouts and
these things even out but sometimes they are not that even.  For Christ
sake we are in the 21st Century and we should act like it.
