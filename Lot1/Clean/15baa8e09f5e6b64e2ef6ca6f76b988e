Speaking as one who went through this all last year during Irene, believe
me, you have my deepest sympathies.

I am closer than California and have lots and lots of room (6 bedrooms), but
we ARE 3 hours away from NYC.  However, if anybody needs shelter until their
home is available, really, seriously, contact me.

About the porn spam -- I suspect somebody thinks it is funny to send
mountains of sex mail to a children's literature discussion list.

Best of luck to all of you.  Roxanne and your niece are lucky to have you.
If we were closer (you know, not in California) we'd be happy to take people
in as well.
