Subject:[CT Birds] the Beauty of Cormorants
I chanced upon 5 DC Cormorants on the pond at Elizabeth Park. I had never really looked at them so closely before. Their pouches were a deep yellow-orange, reminiscent of the throat of a Blackburnian Warbler. In the light, they just glowed! It's funny how I always thought of Cormorants as somewhat unattractive birds, but my view has changed.

Also of note: one male hooded merg, one kingfisher, a great blue heronh,canada geese and mallards.
