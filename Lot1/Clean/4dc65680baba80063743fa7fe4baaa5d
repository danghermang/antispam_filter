Subject:[CT Birds] Boothe WW Crossbills 11/3
11/3 Stratford, Main Street Putney, Boothe Memorial Park - I joined fellow 
hawkwatchers (C. Barnard, L. Jones, T. Murray) for a short while mid-afternoon. 
 Besides a decent buteo migration, we saw a flock of 5 WHITE-WINGED CROSSBILLS 
flying and calling overhead. I assume Scott K. or Lynn J. will report on the 
raptors and other migrants.
