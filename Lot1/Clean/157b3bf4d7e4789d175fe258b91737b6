Hi Marc, Robert, and all,

Congratulations to Jerry and his group for their find and to Marc,Rob, Jake=
 and =

Jeff for their great work and call (a "10" before stones were even found).

A little history of the area where the new fall occurred.=A0 This is the 5t=
h =

witnessed fall to occur in this small area of NW Alabama that measures abou=
t 60 =

miles by 50 miles.=A0 Two falls occurred here in 1868; Danville (L6) fell o=
n Nov. =

27 and eight days later Frankfort (stone) fell on Dec. 5.=A0 During the 20t=
h =

century Leighton (H5) fell in 1907 and Athens (LL6) fell in 1933.=A0 Finall=
y we =

have the latest fall near Addison, located only about 10 miles from the fir=
st =

fall at Danville.

Two falls also fell in adjacent states within 75 miles of this small=A0NW A=
labama =

area.=A0 Baldwyn (L6), Mississippi fell in 1922 and Petersburg (Eucrite), =

Tennessee fell in 1855. =



That's seven falls during the last 144 years in this small area.=A0 Perhaps=
 this =

is the fabled "Meteorite Graveyard;" the place that meteors go to die!=A0 S=
ounds =

like a good place to move to.

Cheers,

Frank

Hi List,

=A0 ( Marc Fries was kind enough to host/post this to the list for me since=
 I =

can't send photos thru the List) Please see the exciting news below, as wel=
l as =

a couple of photos of the stone.

=A0 *************************************************************

=A0 I am happy to have the pleasure of being able to announce that the firs=
t stone =

from the new Alabama fall last Tuesday, Oct 30th has been found!

=A0 A big CONGRATS to the team members Stephen Beck, Tommy Brown and Jerry =
Hinkle =

on their beautiful find late yesterday evening (11-3-12), almost exactly 4 =
days =

to the hour from the time of the fall. Great job, guys!

=A0 No exact weight available yet, but best guess is near 60grams. Appears =
to be =

an OC, possibly brecciated. This particular specimen has a prominent metal =
vein =

on one corner.

=A0 Also a big THANK YOU to Marc Fries, Jeff Fries, Rob Matson, and Jake Sc=
haefer =

for their fantastic work with the radar! Most List members probably know th=
at =

Jerry and I have been meteorite-hunting partners for over 20 years now. We =
had =

just subscribed to Galactic Analytics on Friday, 11-2. I had to work this =

weekend and couldn't join him (my wife said I should have asked someone to =
work =

for me- she was right... again ;-) on this hunt, but Jerry headed to Alabam=
a =

Sat. morning with the maps, and by the end of the day, a meteorite was in h=
and! =

Now if that isn't a great testimony to the value of the GA radar map servic=
e, I =

don't know what would be. Great job by you guys, too!

=A0 Now for a little back ground on the other members of the team and the s=
tory of =

how these guys got together to find a "find-of-a-lifetime".

=A0 Stephen Beck is a good friend of mine who has several very interesting =
hobbies =

and a very successful practice, but meteorite hunting is something he had n=
ever =

actually got to do. Ironically, I had told him less than two weeks ago that=
 the =

next time I went on a hunt I would definitely invite him. How were we to kn=
ow =

that it would only be a few days before HE would be contacting me about his =

local news station there in AL describing a tremendous fireball that evenin=
g, =

complete with sonic booms. Not 5 minutes later, another friend sent me an e=
mail =

saying that Mike (Farmer) had just called him from Germany saying he had ju=
st =

learned of the fall and that there were almost certainly stones on the grou=
nd =

there. I told Jerry about it and since he's living the good life now and ha=
d =

plenty of time to go, he started making plans to go Sat morning. We arrange=
d for =

him to meet up with Stephen and his
friend, Tommy Brown, who knew the area well. When they found the stone, the=
y =

sent me a photo and I forwarded it to Mike. No doubt about it!

(see the photos of the stone that Marc is hosting for us)


=A0 Best wishes,
=A0 Robert Woolard

Howdy, all - Marc Fries writing now...

I have started up a gallery of meteorite photos on the Galactic Analytics w=
eb =

page!=A0 I want to fill this gallery with pictures of meteorites that we he=
lp you =

recover. I need to figure out how to add labels with the meteorites' names =
and =

the names of the finder/owner, but here it is in a simple state for now.=A0=
 This =

page will remain open to the public and will not need a subscription to vie=
w.

Pictures are available here:

Congratulations to Stephen Beck, Tommy Brown, Jerry Hinkle, and Robert Wool=
ard =

for making the FIRST find of this fall!=A0 We are calling this meteorite Ad=
d001 =

for now, but we may change the name (but not the number!) if the name submi=
tted =

to the Nomenclature Committee is different from "Addison".

Congratulations again!
