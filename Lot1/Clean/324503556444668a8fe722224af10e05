Subject:Re: [EVDL] 3D modeling
Actually it's already like printing. Coating the foils.

I briefly evaluated the idea of material toner which could be fit in
certain standard laserprinters. Using the paper as a separator and
printing the anode and cathode to opposite sides. It's doable but
materials have to be developed specifically to this kind of printing.
Contamination issues are still a hurdle but when materials evolve we
can do it.

What I had in mind was a bit more traditional. Using foils. Cutting
them from standard rolls to fit the special requirements. Cells could
be installed in one large thin-walled plastic box (printable) with
separate cell compartments. Box is sealed and only then electrolyte
added. After storing the cells after formation charge (done with the
BMS and main charger) we can see defects. It's still possible to cut
one cell off and replace it if needed.

Quality issues what was mentioned can be addressed with taking that
additional effort in quality control. Doing that with smart BMS with
remote diagnostics would not leave anyone sitting at the side of the
road. If replacement is needed we did something horribly wrong.

I developed a method earlier to bypass a cell if it goes bad. BMS
takes it down to 0VDC in a controlled way. After it has been done a
short circuit block it stroke through sealed box lid. You'll go along
until enough cells have reached the end of life. You would not see
performance drop in a 100 cell string if one is off.
