Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Luiz another less than competent display.

You knew it was coming when we just refused to attack when we won the ball as Swansea decided to push.  We counter attack well-we do not defend well.  Sturridge (if he was going to come on at all) should have replaced Torres.  Oscar should have been left on the field-not Hazard.  Romeu has had his chance-he makes Mikel look like a cheetah.  (I know he's young and may improve, but I don't see it yet.)  When he first came in he could tackle.  Didn't see one today.

Free kicks were a joke.  At the end Ashley Cole is left to try to send it in.  When Hazard was called up for taking the free kick too early-he should have run to take the free kick. Cole is notoriously horrid on them.  (This was actually one of his better ones.

Two points kicked into touch-and I fear for the Shaktar game.
