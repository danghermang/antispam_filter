You can, with the implicit agreement of the LIR who holds the allocation
and the explicit agreement of a third party provider.  If either choose not
to play agree, then your multihoming plans either won't work (third party
disagrees) or can be screwed up (LIR disagrees).  Either way, it's not
provider independent in any meaningful way and can lead to serious business
harm if there is a breakdown in any of the arrangements.
