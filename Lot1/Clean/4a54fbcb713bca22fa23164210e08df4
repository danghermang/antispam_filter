I is chastized :-). Yes my home PC is auto login, no password is not 
possible and I'm not very worried about tech savy burglars, I doubt most 
could even find the KDE menu. There is nothing remotely compromising, 
really, on my PC. And even if sudo was passwordless who, relative or 
burglar, is going to set up a linux botnet/stuxnet exploit on my PC? 
They are welcome to my award winning essay on the semiotics of LOL cats...

Yup facebook, google and amazon are logged in always, so I suppose our 
burglar could order stuff from amazon (needs a delivery address) and yes 
most sites that need a password have an easy one, if you speak Serbian, 
but then there's nothing you can do on them except post comments. But 
online banking is shttp, demands three sets of verification and a 
password generator with a debit card for transfers.

If someone parks in the drive, sniffs my FTP credentials and somehow 
manages to set up a botnet with the hosting company, well it's the 
hosting companies problem not mine. I don't do FTP updates in cafes, 
only reservation dates (www.oldhouse-cottage.co.uk - shameless plug) via 
google calendar.

Your concerns about internet security are valid and true, but my data is 
worthless (I don't mind google serving me adverts), but it is also true 
that most attacks are via compromised websites. I still think talking on 
the bus is a valid metaphor for net usage, someone will probably be able 
to hear what you say, but as most of what you say is trivial who cares?!

And yes if I was doing security for a company I would make people sign 
something saying they would not visit fake torrents sites, in fact give 
them a limited number of URLs possible.

OK, enouf. I'm just off to complete a really great deal with the 
daughter of a Nigerian millionaire....

Si

I humbly suggest
you get the hell off the internet and put us all out of your misery

:-)
