Subject:[child_lit] Opportunity to blog with Andri Magnason
Andri Snaer Magnason will be answering questions about "The Story of the Blue Planet" on the blog for my classes. If anyone is interested in asking him questions feel free to jump in. The first time an individual comes on the blog I have to moderate your post so don't worry if it doesn't show up immediately (especially if power goes out from Sandy). The discussion is asynchronous.   http://childrenslitblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/the-story-of-the-blue-planet/

"On a blue planet far out in space there are no adults, only children. They are wild children who play when they want to and go to sleep when they are tired, without anyone telling them what to do. Then a mysterious man lands on the planet, and teaches them how to fly when the sun shines by flicking the dust off butterflies wings. A perilous adventure ensues, taking the children through dark forests, deep valleys and skies of blue. Their friendship and ingenuity are put to the test as never before in the most dangerous adventure a child could imagine."
