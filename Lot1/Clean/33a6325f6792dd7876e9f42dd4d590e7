I think a better solution would be selling the car and leasing the battery =

pack.  The car could be sold for the same price as the ICE version (maybe =

even a bit less -- an electric motor is less expensive than an ICE).

There could be several lease options.  Lease a battery pack with a =

guaranteed capacity of X KWH.  When it can no longer retain that capacity, =

the leasee returns to the dealer and exchanges it for another battery pack =

with the same guaranteed capacity.  Somebody who only needs a gauranteed =

capacity of Y KWH (with Y < X) could then lease that first pack =

(presumably for a lower price).  When the pack is no longer capable of Y =

KWH, it could be leased again with a guaranteed capacity of Z (Z < Y) KWH.

This would create lots of alternatives.  Suppose a battery pack of a
capacity equal to multiple times a driver's normal useage is required for
a few days.  The driver could go to the dealer and exchange the daily pack
for a larger pack for a few days.

This would also lead to standardized battery packs and third party =

solutions from battery manufacturers who didn't get their batteries into =

the automakers' battery packs.

When a battery pack no longer has the capacity to be useful in mobile
applications, it could be shipped to an alternative energy (e.g. solar,
wind) installation for use in grid stability applications.  When battery
packs are no longer useful for this stationary application, they are all
in one place and can be easily recycled into a new battery pack.  Build =

the recycling facility at the same place as the alternative energy =

installation.  The cargo cariers that bring used packs to the installation =

can return with newly recycled ones.

Sell Electric Cars Like Smartphones
by Carl Pope  10/24/2012

Three big barriers are slowing electric vehicles. One can be fixed by the
auto industry tomorrow -- and if it is, the other two will melt away as the
electric vehicle sector expands.

Start with a simple but surprising fact: Right now, leasing a GM Volt [pih]
for only two years costs you less than its gasoline counterpart, the Cruze
[ice]. The Volt leases for $69 a month more than the Cruze, but saves $200 a
month in fuel by operating most of the time on electricity. The $1800 higher
down payment for leasing the Volt is paid off in 14 months -- you make money
for the last 10 months of your lease!

Almost no one knows this -- GM hasn't been shouting about it from the
roof-tops. Clearly the company loses money leasing Volts at this price.
Because most drivers don't lease, GM knows it won't, if it keeps the secret,
sell more Volts at a loss than it wants too.

But the choice of a below-cost lease as a way to build the market for the
Volt -- along with the necessity of doing so stealthily -- shows that the
auto industry hasn't figured out that electric cars need to be sold
differently than internal combustion engines -- just as Apple had to develop
new business models to sell smartphones. Imagine -- and it's just as
feasible as GM's current lease offer -- that you could buy a Volt, or a
Nissan LEAF [EV], for the same price as its gasoline equivalent -- the Cruze
or the Versa. The same price! There would be a catch; to qualify, you would
sign a five-year fuel contract requiring you to buy all of the electricity
you needed for your car for the equivalent of $3 per gallon. You would get a
better car, and guaranteed protection against future increases in the price
of gas, for no additional purchase price. Your risk? Gas averages below $3.

This is how smartphones are sold. The upfront cost of the phone is recovered
through a service contract -- and in my model above, over five years the
owner of the new electric car would pay the current sticker price of a Volt
or LEAF -- because they would pay a premium for the electric fuel they use.

But the car would cost less upfront than a gasoline model, and fueling the
car would also cost less (unless gas averaged below $3 a gallon over the
five-year period.)

So Barrier One is that the auto industry doesn't know how to sell electric
cars. Electrics are smartphones, and car companies are like the old clunky
AT&T monopoly -- after all, they still haven't figured out how to sell them
for a fixed price!

Barrier One is critical, because if GM offered a version of my fuel contract
for the Volt, sales would leap, and volume would follow, and GM would make
money. In turn, the auto industry would quickly solve Barriers Two and
Three.

Barrier Two is the slow development of a critical primary technology --
batteries. The Volt and LEAF have a high sticker price -- about $15,000
higher than their gas equivalents -- mainly because of battery cost and
performance. Full electrics don't get the range American drivers need for
the same reason. (Even my fuel contract sales model for electrics requires
the $7500 federal rebate to pay off the auto companies -- that $7500 is
about the actual economic cost premium for an electric car with gas at
current US prices.)

Advanced battery companies have been suffering in the market -- one, two,
three, just went into bankruptcy -- because the early electric cars that
were their market haven't been selling fast enough. So getting sales of the
Volt, LEAF and other early electrics up fast is a key to solving the battery
problem.

The final barrier is that the necessary enabling technologies for electric
cars are not in place because there has been a lack of certainty that
electrification was the future. In 1910 about 1/3 of the cars on the road
were electric -- and steam engines were widely viewed as the future. The
internal combustion engine's lock on the auto market arrived only in 1915
when Charles Kettering invented the self-starter, which neither electrics
nor steam cars needed. Electric vehicles are a fundamental shift from the
internal combustion drive train, and enabling technologies keyed to them
have not yet been perfected. Weight is key, because energy density with
electrics is lower than with gasoline -- so approaches like those embodied
in the XPRIZE winner Edison2's Very Light Car are incredibly important --
and perhaps four to five years from maturity. Right now companies like
Edison2 have a hard time raising capital because the market for weight
reduction technologies -- like in-wheel suspension -- grows much faster in
an electric car world than in one still dominated by internal combustion
engines.

So there are three barriers -- two of them technological -- blocking the
electric vehicles from dominating the auto market. But the important barrier
is not technical at all; it is adopting the appropriate business model and
selling innovative cars like innovative smartphones with a low upfront cost
recovered with a fuel service contract.

Administration Is Recklessly Destroying a Century of Environmental Progress,
