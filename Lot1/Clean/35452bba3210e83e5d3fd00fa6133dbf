Subject:[Chelsea] Muddy Marvellous! How Mata the studious choirboy learned
 his skills on boggy pitches [Mail]
By Alex Kay

Long before he was cutting open Premier League defences with his
passing and reminding us that footballers with beards  are not just a
Seventies fad, Juan Mata was knee deep  in football.

Knee deep in a Hackney Marshes sense, that is, wading through mud on
boggy pitches in northern Spain, a little boy trying to stick to his
footballing principles.

Pass the ball, find some space, then pass it again. So much for the
theory that the Spanish ping the ball about because of the perfect
pitches and the English lump it  forward because of the rain, wind and
mud.

They are the principles which see him line up at Stamford Bridge  on
Sunday as Chelsea=92s most  in-form player and the man  Manchester
United will have to stop if they are to make up ground on the league
leaders.

The gap is four points but some other numbers =97 ones of which
statistic-keen Mata will no doubt be aware =97 paint a happier story for
Sir Alex Ferguson=92s side. It has been five matches since Chelsea beat
United and Mata has only scored one home league goal at since the
sides drew 3-3 in February.

However, two goals at Tottenham last weekend made it six for the
season =97 already half of his tally for the previous campaign =97 so as
his friends and family gather in the town of Oviedo where he grew up
to watch the biggest match of the season so far, they will feel
confident that a home win is on the cards for the boy they call Juanin
so as not to confuse him with his father, also named Juan.

=91The pitches were not good when he was a boy,=92 says Fernando
Fernandez Cachero, the long-time secretary of Mata=92s youth club,
Juventud Estadio.

=91Think of how small he is now  (5ft 7in) and imagine what he was like
then, trawling through huge puddles and the mud. He was covered from
head to toe. And in conditions like that you shouldn=92t be able to pass
a ball properly but he did.=92

=91He scored a lot of goals here but he stood out for what he does now =97
those killer final balls,=92 says his cousin David Mata, who works for
Real Oviedo, once a grand La Liga club for whom Stan Collymore briefly
played but now a struggling team in the third tier of Spanish football
with a 30,000-seat stadium that is impossible to fill.

=91I coached him between 13 and 15. After a few days I knew I had a
player who was going to the top. He had everything you see now: the
imagination, the control of the ball, his ability to spot a pass.

'It=92s something you just have from a young age. You can=92t really coach
it. We had a game in Gijon and he scored a ridiculous goal.

'He plucked a really high ball out of the air, flicked it up with his
first touch and fired it into the net with a volley off the other
foot. It was from a long way out, too.=92

United know all about his ability to volley. A superb strike in
February put Chelsea 2-0 up at Stamford Bridge before a Wayne
Rooney-inspired comeback led to that 3-3 draw. Genetics must play a
part because Mata=92s father was a winger for Real Oviedo.

=91Football was always on the television and Juan went to a lot of
matches,=92 says cousin David. =91He used to watch a lot of videos of
Romario, Marco van Basten  and Michael Laudrup.

'But his parents and his sister Paula drummed it into him from early
on that a footballer=92s career is short and that he had to study so
there was something for him afterwards.

'He still does now and is doing degrees in marketing and sports
science. If you listen to his interviews, he knows about the
opposition, he knows statistics. He goes into games full of
information. And he was in the choir when he was young for a few
years, too.=92

Everyone you talk to in Oviedo =97 and they are keen to discuss a boy
repeatedly described as mature and kind =97 mentions Mata=92s thirst for
knowledge.

=91I remember him being fascinated by different cultures,=92 says Carmelo
Bardon, his teacher from his primary school, Gesto 1. =91You can see his
intelligence in the way he plays now, the way he can just pick out
that final pass.

=91But he didn=92t have much chance to play football here in normal
conditions. Space in the centre of town was so tight that when they
did play there would be five matches going on at once on one pitch.
You can imagine the keepers diving to make a save and almost diving
into the keeper next to him playing in a  different match.=92

It=92s been a story that has taken the 24-year-old from cramped and
muddy pitches to ones covered in confetti and empty champagne bottles.

As well as Chelsea=92s Champions League and FA Cup successes last
season, Mata has World Cup and Euro 2012 winner=92s medals to his name
and now his home town is doing its best to honour him.

Juan Mata Park was opened near his grandmother=92s house three days
after Chelsea=92s Champions League win, his youth club are renaming
their stadium after him and they host a tournament each winter in his
name in which 90 teams from across northern Spain take part.

There=92s a similar love for him at Valencia, the club where he
realised his potential after being jettisoned by Fabio Capello at Real
Madrid.

=91He was 15 when he signed for Real and it was a good age to go to a
big club like that,=92 says David. =91It was a one-in-a-million chance and
the right thing to do, even though it was a tough decision to leave
home so young.

=91But it wasn=92t easy getting into the team at a time when they had
Zinedine Zidane, Guti, David Beckham, Raul and so many others. It was
no shame not getting in the first team at that stage.=92

Forty-six goals and 52 assists in 176 games for Valencia soon put him
on the right course and caught Chelsea=92s attention.

=91He=92s a champion of Europe, World Cup winner, Champions League
winner,=92 says David. =91People  recognise him when he=92s home, he is an
idol to children.=92

And a few thousand Chelsea fans to boot.
