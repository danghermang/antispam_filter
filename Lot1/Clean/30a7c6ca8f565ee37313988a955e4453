Subject:[CT Birds] Hamden:  our 1st Juncos
North Lake, Hamden.

Finally, some Juncos under the feeders today.  Along with some 1st year Red Winged Black Birds, in several different forms -- really quite lovely and varied with their bronze filagree and tints -- almost doubted the species for a bit.

Flo:  Juncos not seen on RWA property itself, but within 10'.
