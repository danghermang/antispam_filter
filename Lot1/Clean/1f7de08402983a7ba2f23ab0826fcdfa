Subject:[bcp] One Got Fat 1963 Bicycle Safety
Well I happened to be watching retro tv (there was some horrid 1959 black
and white "thriller" on) and this little clip showed up and I looked it up
on U tube, and thought that some of you might find it amusing, and also an
interesting look at what has and has not changed re: bike safety. Since I
am relatively new to the bike club, forgive me if this has been posted
before. It is slow so just keep watching.
