It will work as long as you limit your draw to about 1.5kW or less. I'd adv=

The Leaf's DC-DC converter can supply up to about 1.7kW or 135a. This unit =

One interesting thing is, unlike the 12v system on a ICE car, there is almo=

I guess that the 121-122 that the meter showed is the voltage.
Long time ago I measured the continuous motor power from a medium
size fridge at 190 Watts, so the continuous load should be in the
order of 120V 2A, which translates to about 20A from the aux battery.
I agree that the peak can be several times higher, but the continuous
load should be no problem.
ICE alternators can generate (close to) max current at idle because
the field is cranked up until it puts out 14+V so it is just a matter
of how thick its windings are, what current it can deliver.
I regularly see 80A alternators on larger cars and people with heavy
audio equipment sometimes install either a second alternator or replace
the existing one with a heavier duty version to deliver the 100+ Amps
that the audio equipment might consume in extreme cases.
Personally I think that my 5W stock car radio is loud enough...

The piece's video mentioned not to try it with an ice mainly because of
the exhaust fumes in an enclosed garage.

But even if the ice was outside & the cord was run into the home, with
the ice at a fast idle, is the ice alternator designed to put out enough
current to maintain the starter battery?

Or would the starter battery be quickly drained down to where there was
too much 12V current load on the ice alternator which would result in
burning out either the alternator or any circuitry controlling the
output current?

Ignoring inefficiencies, a 7A load at 120VAC would be a 70A load at 12V.
Am I wrong in assuming most ice do not put out 70A at 12V continuously?

In the video it showed his power meter reading 1.2 . If that was the Amp
load, that seemed way too low to power a household frig. I would think
the man's frig might have a start up current of 7A and a continuous
compressor running load of 5A at 120VAC. If that is more realistic, then
that 5A would translate to 50A at 12A, and perhaps when generalizing on
the inefficiencies, more like 70A at 12V being demanded from the ice
alternator to run that frig continuously.

Looking at the video and the size and type of frig, anyone have some
more accurate/better numbers than mine?

...
I posted about doing something similar to this in the past, but it can
not be found in the archives (so much of my previous work since the
1990's is gone). So, off the top of my head:

When I was an hp CE and maintained the computer equipment for all three
buildings at the Sunnyvale hp site with my coworker CE, we had some
interesting situations that regularly occurred.

The site was leased so hp did not rip out and correct the site's
problems like they would if they owned it. The site electricians told me
the reason the power would randomly go out on any one or all of the
buildings at anytime was because the site owner went cheap and used
aluminum power cabling. These changed with time and temperature, so the
electricians had to regularly re-seat those power lines coming from the
three phase high voltage transformers. It wasn't a utility issue, it was
at the power junction in the building going out to all the buildings' AC
loads.

Bottom line: the power could go out just when you did not want it to,
which not only caused a lot of grief (loss of your work), but it made my
fellow CE and I scramble to shutdown the mainframes properly and turn
off all equipment on all floors of each affected building so ringing
power spikes did not kill the equipment when the power did come back on.

The other issue was the network. This was a time when there were
whispers of an Internet, but companies had their own networks that one
had to navigate, gateway-ing from one to another to get connected to
your "Intranet". This was also about the time when Ethernet (RJ45) was
being whispered to take over for the ThinLAN (10base2) that we were
using way back then.

Bottom line: sometimes you could not connect to the computer you wanted
if one computer along the chain you gateway'd through was
blocked/off/disabled. This usually happened when there was a power
outage (it took time to get all the computers back up and sometimes the
IT-people took the opportunity to do some other 'work' that kept it down
longer.). Interestingly, the site's telephones never went down during
these times.

So, to complete ye-ol' paperwork of all my daily repair calls, it could
be tough. That is why I rigged a modem so I could dial up straight to
the main computer where the dumb-terminal work was entered on (those
were pre-PC days). We got the hand me down/left-over equipment, so I was
quite happy when I got to upgrade to a 9600 baud modem (oooh so much
faster than 2400).


OK, so one afternoon all heck broke loose. My fellow CE and I had done
our bit, and now we could do nothing until the power was back on and
then wait again until all the needed computers were back up. He had
already called the boss and his wife telling them that we (he and I)
would be working late again to enter in all the onscreen paperwork when
all was back up. He, as usual when this happened, then took off to
wander around chatting away to kill time.

I however was prepared. With my S-10 Blazer conversion EV just outside
the shop's door, with my DC2DC on, I hooked up a 12VDC to 120VAC
inverter on my 12V Aux battery and plugged in a couple of my long 12-3
extension cords running them under the closed exit door and to my bench.
I powered up the dumb-terminal and the modem, then dialed in. Voil=E0! My
main pack kept my 12V Aux battery charged, which fed the inverter, which
powered the 120VAC load.

When my fellow CE came back, he saw what I had done (looking at the 12-3
cord running from my area to the door) and was a bit ticked that I had
completed my hour's worth of daily onscreen entry paperwork, and that I
was going to leave on-time (5pm). This just put another notch on his "I
do not like Bruce's EV" stick, because I was more imaginative and
proactive than he was (his ego got bruised, ... again).
