List, Ed, Jim,

The phrase "ashtray belt" can be found in all
follow-on news stories like this one:
http://www.ksbw.com/news/central-california/salinas/Stunning-meteor-showers-wow-Central-Coast-sky-watchers/-/5738906/17042872/-/dia4eb/-/index.html

This is because it originally appeared in the
first Associated Press story. It was shortly
thereafter corrected, but every source that
used that AP item before the correction has
the "ashtray belt" quote in it.

It was a reporter's mishearing the phrase
"asteroid belt" that gave rise to it, I presume,
but how long will the story stick to Jonathan
Braidman, "an astronomer at Oakland's Chabot
Space and Science Center"?

He'll be living in the Ashtray Belt for a heck
of a long time...
