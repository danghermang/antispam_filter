Subject:[Flexradio] RFI on 10 meter
I have had my FLEX-5000A for a couple of months now, and I love it. Get great reports on audio on all bands, (haven't tested 6 meter yet, since I don't have an antenna for this band), but on 10 meter they complain about really bad RF in the audio. What can be the cause, and what can I do about it?
