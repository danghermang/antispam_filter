Subject:Re: [h-cost] Embroiderry software
Do you know if Wilcom will sell their embroidery software separate from 
Corel's Draw package?  I am a long-time Corel user and I have both 
versions X5 (which the Wilcom is integrated with) and X6. I'd be 
delighted to use the software I am already familiar with for everything 
except features that are specifically embroidery related, such as 
assigning stitches.  But I don't want to buy redundant copies of the 
Corel non-embroidery software.

Thanks for any information,

Fran

Pulse designed for 32 bit computers will NOT work on 64 bit !! The upgrade is a mere $5000. Pretty steep when it was them that didn't consider future compatibilty. Wilcom offers similar features and a similar price for a trade in. They really seem to be the biggest commercial brands (in English speaking countries anyway)Having said that, there is freebie stuff around e.g. Sofiesew and Thread. Both have strengths and weaknesses. For a full commercial grade software, I-cliqq is pretty good value for money, but it is still expensive for fully functional software rather than limited size/ stitch numbers or rearranging existing designs. You can buy or commission a lot of designs for the price of the software. If you do commission a design, specify what textural finish you want or you wi!

I know my requirements a different from a domestic machine, but if you are doing costume work you will also need to have options for underlay stitches and changing density to account for differing fabrics. Some of the cheaper domestic programs may not have many options.Feel free to contact me for any other information. I hope to have my new software in the next week or so and may be able to take digitizing commissions as soon as I am up and running. At least a fellow costumer will have a better idea of authentic look than some off shore cheapie firms.
