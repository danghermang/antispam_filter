Subject:[meteorite-list] Ad - Anyone looking for a Gebel Kamel upgrade
Hello all and Happy Veterans Day to all of our past and present members of 
the armed services

I am selling a nice Gebel that I got in a trade, ends in a couple hours. If 
you are looking to upgrade to a one-pounder the rate is still in your favor.
