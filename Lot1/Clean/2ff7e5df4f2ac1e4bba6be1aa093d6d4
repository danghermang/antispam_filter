Subject:[CT Birds] Whirlewind Hill Road - Wallingford - Greater
	White-fronted Goose

Whirlewind Hill Road - Large Flock of Canada Geese, It contained 1 adult GWF Goose and 1 white phase snow goose. It also contained an odd hybrid goose that has been present for several years. Any idea what this bird is. Canada x greater white front or canada x domestic goose. I am sure that many of you have seen this odd goose.
