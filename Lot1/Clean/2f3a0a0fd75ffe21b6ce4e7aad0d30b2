Subject:Re: r8168b woes
Okay I finally gave up on trying to get nvidia-dkms working on the
3.2.0-4 kernel and just booted to text mode to try out mediatomb,
which was one of the few applications that seems to give consistant
failures by stressing the network card. It looks like 3.2.0-4 is
stable on my machine, so hopefully the next version of Debian will at
least have that fix in the kernel by the time the next release rolls
around.

Thanks for the help and I hope my contribution will at least give some
confidence as to which version of the driver is working correctly.
