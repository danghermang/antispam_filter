Subject:[child_lit] book about shoes
Hey, Guys-

There was a book, might have been older than it was in the 70s when I had
it, about a little girl who asked everyone to get her shoes for her
birthday. She got shoes of every kind... but very quickly, they were too
small!

Does anyone remember this book? I have tried to google it, but I must be
asking the wrong question since I have never had a hit.
