Ed and Clemens

I think that is right, 322 contains a lot of detailed statistical
information about noise.  670 is a report of only a few pages entitled
something like "Radio noise in the range 0.1 Hz to 100 GHz", and all
the diurnal and seasonal variations are left out, so the number of
graphs is very small.  Thanks for those references.

For those that haven't looked at noise in detail, external or
atmospheric noise is quantified as the noise power supplied by a
perfect monopole, measured in dBs above the thermal noise (kTB) from
the antenna's radiation resistance.  The minimum level is measured at
quiet sites, and the CCIR also collects data for business areas and
other environments.

We can use the minimum noise level as the basis for designing receive
antennas for communications and radar systems.  For the AM system at 1
MHz that we were looking at, a perfect antenna at the edge of the
coverage area (field-strength 1 mV/m) produces a signal power of -16
dBm, which compares with thermal noise at -134 dBm.  Minimum external
noise is (let's say) 50 dB above thermal noise, so it's at -84 dBm.
That means that if a lossless antenna is used, external noise is 68 dB
below the signal and thermal noise is 118 dB below the signal, at the
antenna terminals.

A comms system at this frequency would need a receiver noise figure of
50 dB, of which perhaps 10 dB could be allocated to the receiver and
40 dB to the antenna loss.  That would put thermal noise at the same
level as minimum external noise.

On the other hand a broadcast receiver can use a worse noise figure,
perhaps 80 dB, because external noise then goes down to 30 dB below
thermal noise, while the AM signal at -96 dBm is still 38 dB above
thermal noise.

That explains the use of ferrite antennas in AM receivers :)  Without
the ferrite, the additional loss of about 20 dB would not give an
adequate signal to thermal noise ratio.
