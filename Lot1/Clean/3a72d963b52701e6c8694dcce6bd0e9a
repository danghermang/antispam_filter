	Mikelallegation [Independent]
Do I think Clattenburg has been told by the FA he will be cleared? No, I 
don't think he has. I don't think even the FA would be that stupid.
Why are you so upset that he is confident he will be cleared? Assume for a 
moment, he never said anything inappropriate. Then why wouldn't he be 
confident?
Do I think there have been background briefings by the ref's union and 
friends of Clattenburg? Yes, I do. And why shouldn't there be? Chelsea were 
doing background briefings. Hell, the club even issued a statement accusing 
Clattenburg. But he is supposed to keep absolutely silent and not even allow 
it to leak that his position is that he said nothing inappropriate?
Get real.
And the Mirror piece you cite is a complete red herring. The journo throws 
in one line: "... in a move that might be viewed as inappropriate while 
awaiting the results of investigations by the police and football 
authorities" in a desperate attempt to pretend that he's not just copying 
and pasting the Standard's story. Bullshit stuff. No evidence of anything 
except the Mirror reporter and his editor thought they might see whether 
anyone might bite. They couldn't get a rent-a-quote to say it's prejudicial, 
so they throw out the hoary old "might be viewed" because they haven't found 
anyone yet to say it. Probably because no one sees it as prejudicial.
