It seems unlikely that you're blowing the parts from overcurrent. That 
means they are failing due to overvoltage. Since your pack voltage is 
much lower than the part's voltage breakdown rating, I suspect snubber 
problems.

Is there an RC or RCD snubber on the IGBT? If so, check or replace its 
parts. The resistor may have opened up, or the capacitor developed a 
high ESR. Snubbers have to carry very high peak currents and voltages, 
and while the average power dissipation isn't all that high, the stress 
levels can easily murder the parts.
