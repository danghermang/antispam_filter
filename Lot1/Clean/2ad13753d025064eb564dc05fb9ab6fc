Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Swansea FT
I agree about Torres, he was absolutely useless.  TBH I think RDM should
tell him he is out until January and he should start looking for another
club - Athletico Madrid perhaps in a swap plus cash deal.  Maybe he can
join Malouda with the youth team. Give Sturridge or Moses a run out and
give them some games  - they cannot do any worse.  Unfortunately he does
not have it anymore and when he was put through on goal at a decent angle I
was yelling "shoot" but he passed and it and it came to nothing.  Maybe we
should do a Spain and play without a conventional striker because that is
what we are essentially doing at the moment.
