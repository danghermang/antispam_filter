Subject:Re: [Maps-l] License change of OpenStreetMap to ODbL
I had in mind that the OSM default style file is published under CC0 and 
not CC-BY-SA[1]. If this is correct we should this license.

For the OSM-Gadget and WIWOSM it should be a small effort to change the 
attribution.

For three layers we have in OSM-Gadget 3 attributions and limited space, 
Parts of the attribution are translated by translate wiki. Our 
attributions are in the moment:
"Map by OpenStreetMap (CC-BY-SA), Wikipedia (CC-BY-SA), WIWOSM"

I would change it to
"(c) OpenStreetMap contributors: license, Wikipedia (CC-BY-SA), WIWOSM"

As mention here[2]. Would this be correct?

To make the right attribution easier, it would be nice if osm.org would 
have the attribution on the map like it want have it on external maps, 
because else I believe the ODBL-documentation in the OSM-Wiki is very 
complex and confusing.
