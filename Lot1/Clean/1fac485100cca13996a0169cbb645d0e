It's hard to puzzle out the circuit from the photograph, but as near as 
I can tell, it's wired like this (view with a fixed width font like 
Courier):

         0.01uF 100 ohms
          __||__/\/\__
         |  ||        |
  pack+__|______\_____|______

         0.1uF? 100 ohms?

The photo has pack- at the top and pack- at the bottom. The lower RC 
snubber is invisible, but I'm guessing it's there.

The diode isn't really necessary in this circuit. A diode is used in 
this location when switching an inductive load. But your ceramic heater 
is basically a resistive load. The only inductance would come from the 
length of the wires used to connect the heater. This inductance is 
small, so the voltage spike produced is tiny, and the relay and snubbers 
can handle it by themselves. I would suggest removing the diode.

As to why the fuse blows with the diode installed: Either the diode is 
wired backwards, or its breakdown voltage is less than the pack voltage.
