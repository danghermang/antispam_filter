Subject:Re: [Koha] Koha Digest, Vol 84, Issue 38
Dear Vimal,

I just have gone through your thread of koha livecd.

We have been working hard on getting latest koha livecd but koha versions
above 3.8 all give following error while searching OPAC. I had posted this
query on IRC  but had not got any answer. After all the attempts of trial
we could bring live CD with 3.6.9 on lubuntu 12.04. We have just finished
compiling the one with lUbuntu, DSpace 1.8.2, Koha 3.6.9 & Drupal 7.15. We
have used uck for compiling the liveCD. We will soon be uploading on
sourceforge.

I am giving herewith the error in koha-zebraqueue-output.log. This has been
already posted earlier but had not found any answer and because of which we
could not announce livecd. Finally we decided to use 3.6 version. If anyone
has any fix available for this error pl. let us know and we can try
compiling koha with 3.8.5.

DBD::mysql::st execute failed: Table 'koha.zebraqueue' does not exist at
/home/koha/bin/zebraqueue_daemon.pl line 124.
DBD::mysql::st fetchrow_hashref failed: fetch() without execute() at
/home/koha/bin/zebraqueue_daemon.pl line 125.

The above lines get repeated.

If anyone has any answer to it we will try to incorporate that change and
create livecd with latest version of koha.
