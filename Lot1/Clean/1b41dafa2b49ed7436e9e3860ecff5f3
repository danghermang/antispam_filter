Subject:[Yale Cycling] Triple hill tomorrow 8 am
Hi,

I'm doing the Triple hill route tomorrow morning, with a few
modifications. Here is a map: http://ridewithgps.com/routes/1229618

I'm rolling away at 8:10 sharp from Orange and Cold Spring. If you
want to join plan to be there at 8 and RSVP by email, or text me at
907-887-1622. Pace will moderate to fast, ~17 mph average, with faster
pace lines on some of the longer flats and downhills. Should be back
around 12.
