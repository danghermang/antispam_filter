Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Capture Area
Out here on the west coast of North America, at just over 48 degrees 
latitude (southern Vancouver Island) the "atomic" wristwatch doesn't 
seem to be able to get a signal at all and the watch has to be reset 
manually from time to time.  The nearest signal, if I recall rightly, is 
in Fort Collins Colorado and we are at the very edge of the range at 
60hz or thereabouts.  It is a decent watch, though, so I don't really 
mind, but I wonder if I wound a larger loop and left the watch near it 
for awhile if that might help.  Or maybe reception will get better as 
atmospheric noise declines with the onset of winter.  Actually I haven't 
reset it for awhile and it seems to be withing a second of my GPS so 
that might have happened already, or am I being too optimistic?
