Luckily a lot of the members of public also recognise
that they are being lied to by (paid) media, so the old method
of spreading news via your circle of friends still is one of the
strongest influencers. Just like the "expert" once proclaiming that
no computer user ever needed more than 64kB was swept aside by
early adopters who were running nice games and other programs
in expanded memory and showed their friends, who recognised it as
desirable and not be limited by the "expert" statement.

Adjustable levels of sophisticated display is not so much to
limit the distraction - many drivers will allow far too much
distraction to drive safely and concentrated anyway, but to
make it usable / understandable to the inexperienced users.
I have regularly seen TV remotes with a blank paper taped across
and only cutouts to show the up/down and standby buttons.
All the other buttons are hidden because they are too confusing....

The electronic EV version of this is what Bruce described.

These days the job of a "journalist" is not to inform the public; it's
to 
attract viewers / listeners / readers who will see / hear the
publication's 
ads.  News today is almost 100% entertainment.  The more controversy and

emotional hand-wringing a story has, the more effective it is at this 
objective.  On no account should the writer ever seriously try to
educate 
the audience - unless it's propaganda the publication's owner wants to 
spread.

But this may not be as big an issue as it seems.  "Journalists" are 
generally poorly educated in technology and science.  However, as I 
understand it, the main paying customers for EVs right now are early 
adopters.  They tend to be well educated, far more so than the 
"journalists."  Many are in technical professions.  

These educated folks are pretty well aware of the limitations of modern 
"journalism," and I'd expect (but don't know for sure) that for unbiased

information they'd look instead to other owners' experiences - probably 
reported on the net.  

Thus I'm not so sure that the negative news pieces are much of an
impediment 
now.  However, they might dampen the growth of the field so that mass 
adoption is slowed down or stopped.

I don't think it's much about politics.  It's money.  (But the two often
go 
hand in hand.)

As we saw in early sales of the Prius, well educated early adopters are 
often technically inclined. Thus the assumption seems to have been that
they 
want and expect high-tech instrumentation.  This isn't a new idea; I'm 
pretty sure that the Prius had a touchscreen display before any other
car it 
its price class.

But there may be something to the idea of providing adjustable levels of

display sophistication, so the owner could choose a range of information

from "just the basics" to "almost as distracting as trying to send text 
messages on your mobile phone."
