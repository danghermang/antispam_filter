Thanks for all your labours on our behalf, Michael.

How do I 'make sure that my email account has not been compromised' though?

(I've had three or four today...)

Subject: [child_lit] Information about recent odd posts

In the interest of ending the recent epidemic of unwanted lurid spam that
many list-members have received, I had a long phone conversation and then an
extended email exchange with one of the computer programmers in the Rutgers
Office of Internet Technology today, during which I learned the following: =


The server on which child_lit is located at Rutgers University is not
infected with a worm or virus. Child_lit is not generating the spammy email
we have been receiving. This confirms what we all suspected, since the
emails were not being universally distributed to all child_lit subscribers
or archived in the child_lit archives. The lurid spam is most likely being
sent by a child_lit subscriber, probably inadvertently by a third party who
has hacked that person's email account and has been using it for reasons
that can only be imagined. He or she is obviously not using the hacked
account directly but sending mail through other dummy accounts. The hacked
account does not belong to me. (I sent lurid spam I have received because I
neglected to ask you to send me original posts with full header
information.) All of the lurid spam I shared with our OIT programmer do have
one interesting element in common They all originate from: 109.230.213.200,
which happens to be a German site. =


At this point, the matter has been turned over to the Rutgers mail
administrators, to see what they can find out. If there is some sort of
German Internet authority that could intervene, they should know. However,
it is supposed that like the US, Germany has cooperative organizations that
share info, but no one with the authority to pull the plug on a given site.
At this point I can suggest: make sure that your email account has not been
compromised, and try to ignore the messages. =


I want to thank all of you for being extremely patient during this sordid
business, as well as witty and generous. I am genuinely sorry for the great
inconvenience this has been and for whatever distress it may have caused;
and, as always, thank you for using child_lit. =


Best, =


Michael (Joseph) =
