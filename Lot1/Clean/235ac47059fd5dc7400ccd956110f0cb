Subject:[Antenna-discussion] Imax on DXing
My favorite meter to talk DX on is 11 meters on SSB/LSB if possible 
across the pond but 200 to 2000 miles here in the good old US is 
great as well. 

I have an Imax 2000 and the base of the antenna is around 30' to 
35' from the ground making the tip around 50 to 55' in an open 
field with no obstructions other than my shack within 200'. 

My question is will my Imax 2k work DX on 11 meters LSB from 
35.5000 MHZ to 39.5000 MHZ better with the GPK? Now it seems to 
have a lot of noise such as hash and trash just standard DX 
propagation static and air wave noise. 

So will a Ground Plane Kit help me in any way with Distance or 
the noise floor or even hotter signal or better ears? 

I do use a 225 Galaxy Linear with the preamp off. I get many 5 
over 7 reports as far away as Norway Germany England Canary Islands 
ie 4000 to 5000 miles across the pond. I am in Middle TN. 37115. 

Or am I already doing much better than I deserve? :-) 

I am preparing to take my tech 1 and general class ham tests on 
December 8th here in Nashville and already have a 10 meter cheap 
radio shack radio and am saving top get a multi mode/band/meter 
made by Kenwood by the time I receive my Ticket. I have located 
one that I am dealing on now. 

I intend to use my Imax with as many bands as possible and still 
have a good SWR. 

Thanks Bob
