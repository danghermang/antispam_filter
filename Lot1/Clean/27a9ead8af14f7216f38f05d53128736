Subject:debian-backports consistency during updates?
Hi,
I have setup one Approx apt proxy cache for our company with
debian-backports line:

backports       http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports

During apt-get update on servers I noticed Packages MD5 sum errors for
backports. While retrying I encountered even GPG signature error.
While investigating the problem I have got using wget:

wget http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports/dists/squeeze-backports/Release.gpg
wget http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports/dists/squeeze-backports/Release

following set of results (modification times or versions):

-rw-r--r-- 1 zito zito 77618 Sep 30 05:36 Release
-rw-r--r-- 1 zito zito   836 Oct  2 10:41 Release.gpg

gpg --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d//debian-archive-squeeze-automatic.gpg
--verify Release.gpg Release
gpg: Signature made Tue 02 Oct 2012 10:41:18 AM CEST using RSA key ID 473041FA
gpg: BAD signature from "Debian Archive Automatic Signing Key
(6.0/squeeze) <ftpmaster@debian.org>"

=> inconsistent

after a while:

-rw-r--r-- 1 zito zito 77618 Oct  2 10:41 Release
-rw-r--r-- 1 zito zito   836 Sep 30 05:36 Release.gpg

=> inconsistent

and finaly OK:

-rw-r--r-- 1 zito zito 77618 Oct  2 12:35 Release
-rw-r--r-- 1 zito zito   836 Oct  2 12:35 Release.gpg

gpg --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d//debian-archive-squeeze-automatic.gpg
--verify Release.gpg Release
gpg: Signature made Tue 02 Oct 2012 12:35:52 PM CEST using RSA key ID 473041FA
gpg: Good signature from "Debian Archive Automatic Signing Key
(6.0/squeeze) <ftpmaster@debian.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 9FED 2BCB DCD2 9CDF 7626  78CB AED4 B06F 4730 41FA


It this known bug or feature of backports archive?
