Subject:[Birding-Aus] Safety vests




When is it unsafe to wear a safety vest? Answer: On Victorian wetlands during the duck-shooting season this year.
Three rescuers wearing safety vests and carrying flags at Lake Connewarre were charged during the March-June season with 'harassing and hindering hunters'.
Fortunately, these idiotic charges were withdrawn in late October and costs were awarded against the police (prosecuting).
More seriously, a duck shooter will face charges of unlawful assault and dangerous use of a firearm for this incident on opening morning at Lake Buloke:

Dangerous aggression like this has no place on the wetlands. Nor does duck shooting.
