That version was in unstable from 2011-02-25 until 2011-05-29 in testing 
2011-03-16 until 2011-06-17. 
<http://packages.qa.debian.org/r/redland.html> gives the history. The 
package itself is at
<http://snapshot.debian.org/package/redland/1.0.13-2/#librdf0_1.0.13-2>.

It looks like you managed to partially install testing at some point, 
you probably want to check your system for other packages from testing. 
I believe apt-show-versions can do this for you.
