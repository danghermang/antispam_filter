Subject:[Birding-Aus] RFI - Arid Area Birds
Hi All

A mate and I are doing a trip in early November starting around Hattah-Kulkyne NP in North West Vic, then up through eastern SA up around the Strzelecki, Oodnadatta and Birdsville tracks areas at least as far north as the Strzelecki Regional Reserve and maybe further. Then back to Vic via southern western Qld and western NSW.

Can anyone give us any good spots for any of the specialist birds of these arid areas, particularly but not only, Grey Falcon, Letter-wing Kite, Grasswrens, Whitefaces, etc.

Any info would be gratefully appreciated.

Thanks

Bob
