Subject:Re: [kurtlist] Random poll question
Didn't Brian, Kurt, Elvis and Jeff all skate together?  Or was that before Jeff won Worlds?

How about a fun hockey themed number with lots and lots of footwork.   It sounds goofy I know - but we Canucks do love our hockey and there is an NHL lockout which is a big deal in Canada.  Kurt could tie that in somehow.   Maybe they could use "Hockey Night in Canada" music.  He could also show off and wear his hockey skates LOL

Kurt, Elvis, Jeff, and Patrick are all in the cast for COI. If they were to do a group number together, what do you think it should be? What would you like to see them skate to together? =)
