Subject:[child_lit] Looking for book suggestions
Good Morning,

I am looking for book suggestions to use for a reading group of inner city Latina 7th and 8th grade girls.  I would like something that can related to their lives and that has a strong female protagonist.

Thank you for your time and your thoughts,

Nance
