Subject:[Birding-Aus] Dusky Woodswallow domestic arrangements
Hello John,

In Canberra Bird Notes of June 2000, Ian Rowley reported on his colour-banding study of a small population of Dusky Woodswallows out at Geary's Gap near Lake George.

This is quite a long paper to appear in Canberra Bird Notes and rightfully belongs in a journal with a wider readership, like Corella. I noted also in Hanzab references to a paper of his in Proceedings of the International Ornithological Congress 1976 which I haven't seen.

If you don't have older copies of Canberra Bird Notes, simply Google "Rowley Dusky Woodswallow" and you'll find a PDF of the paper - the short answer to your question is that groups of three are usually a pair + an offspring from the previous year.

This sort of arrangement occurs elsewhere in the Artamidae - Grey Butcherbirds occur mainly as pairs but occasionally as threes - Pied Butcherbirds often as  threes or sometimes fours and with Australian Magpies,  that is where the story really starts!!

Cheers

Graeme
