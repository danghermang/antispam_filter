Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] 1/2-wave vertical really needs a ground
 plane?


Hello Bill,
It's a half wave end fed. It was made by Ham International, but I don't think they make them anymore. It's akin to the Hy-Gain Silver Rod without the spirally radials at the bottom. I have found virtually identical antennas made in Europe such as the Thunderpole 1/2 wave. 

Best Regards,
Greg
