Subject:Re: [EVDL] Mileage / Range for small sports car conversions /
	Thanks to	All!!
OK, but what SPEED are you talking about?  Obviously, if your commute is all at 60+ MPH it is a different matter to doing it all at a steady 40 MPH or 90 miles of stop go traffic, etc... Your comments, tho made in good faith I'm sure, aren't wildly helpful without specifying some sort of speed information.  MW

Any suitcases would have to be in the passenger seat. There is no spare tire anymore. The front has two rows of cells for another 32. While you could place a couple more cells here and there, there's really not room for much more.

>> Thanks for the input on the Z-3 range. Your real world experience is very valuable to me and I thank you for taking the time to share.As I said I am on the horns of a decision; the Z-3 is a well built and engineered platform and I have always thought that it would make a great EV. Although it is 16 years old and has 135K on it, it still has plenty of life left in the EV essentials. It is stylish, has all the essential modern amenities that I need, handles like a go kart and tons of aftermarket upgrade parts are readily available at fairly reasonable prices.

The Z-3 apparently sucked an exhaust valve and while I havn't gotten the head off I have done compression, leakdown and a borescope inspection and could see the damaged valve area but couldn't fully assess the FOD. Its a single Vanos 2.8 and even if the short block is salvageable putting a head on it would cost in the neighborhood of 1K. Swapping out the engine for another good used engine would run between 2K and 4K. After weighing the cost/benefits I don't see that building a new engine for this car makes any sense.

>> My mission for an EV.. I need a real world 100 mile range at legal freeway speeds as I have a weekly 200mi rt commute. During the week 50 miles a day would suit. I only need a 2 place car with room for a couple of suitcases. I would like a car that is comfortable, well built, reasonable amenities and am sick to death of spending dead dinos at the rate of 300 a month+. Can't find a used manufactured EV that is affordable. Downside? I am figuring the cost to convert the Z-3 at $20K and am considering the expected lifetime of batteries and what it would cost to reconfigure the car for a different pack if this one fails prematurely. Hmm...Dach.
