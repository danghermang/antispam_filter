Subject:[Flexradio] Linrad and PowerSDR
I have downloaded Linrad, and want to try to configure for my Flex-5000A, but so far no luck. It stops when I try to set up the sound card. The configuration program displays the available ports, but I cannot select anything from the DOS box.

Anyone out there who knows how to configure?
