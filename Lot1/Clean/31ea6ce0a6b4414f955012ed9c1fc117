That is up to you, remember that these resistors are there to act as fuses =
and will burn up if a tube shorts.

It happened several times with amps using 7868 tubes and one with 6L6, so I=
 installed terminal strips to make it easier.

Hopefully, you'll never need to deal with tube failures.

Rob,
