Subject:Re: [Coral-List] On submission length and conciseness
Dear David,

   - Thank you for sharing your observations and comments.
   - I am guilty of embellishing some myself in the past, but fully concur
   with you.
   - I will amend my errant ways of the past and promise brevity in the
   future.
   - Have a great weekend .... all.

Best regards, Billy
