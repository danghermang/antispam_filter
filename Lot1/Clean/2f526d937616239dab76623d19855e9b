Subject:Re: [CT Birds] where have all the siskins gone?
At least a few of them are at my house -- FINALLY!!!!  My winter birds are 
back -- no one rare, but the juncoes, pine siskins, goldfinches, wt 
sparrows, and song sparrows have joined the usual crew of cardinals, 
chickadees, tufted titmice, downy woodpeckers, hairy woodpeckers, and 
mourning doves.  Just before the storm, all is right with the world.
