Subject:[child_lit] 60+ children's books featuring museum artefacts on
 public display around the world
Dear all,

First of all, many thanks to every one who helped me recently with my 
query re books inspired by / referencing museum artefacts. I've now 
edited the list of books, and sorted by country and museum and it is 
available here:

Thank you again for all the suggestions,

Zoe
