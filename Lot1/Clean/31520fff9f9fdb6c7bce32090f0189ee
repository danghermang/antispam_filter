If you have sand blasting equipment you might want to consider soda 
blasting. From a posting today in the BMW /5 motorcycle mail list:

/Bill Denzer asked about soda blasting rigs. I have no special 
knowledge, but I **did** soda blast the engine and final drive of my 
barn find a few months back, so I'll share what little I learned.

My biggest surprise was that blasting soda looks just like glass beads 
when you open the bag. For some reason, I expected them to be big 
pellets (like the size of BBs) or 1/8 inch diameter cylinders about 1/8 
long. Well, they aren't. It looks like standard glass bead media. (I did 
talk to the people who sell me media, explained what I was doing, and 
they gave me the stuff they recommended - which I don't recall and 
cannot check since I am at work.)/

...

//And it worked, pretty much, like normal. Perhaps not as aggressively 
as "normal" media, but I was just trying to get the nasty stains off the 
engine and final drive.

The second surprise was that the media did not all pulverize and blow 
away. I had been told by **everyone** to "expect a lot of dust", which I 
interpreted to mean "as soon as that soda hits the target, it will 
atomize into fine powder and blow all over." Well, there **was** a good 
deal of dust. But after I was done, I swept up the powder on the 
concrete, and I got about 60 percent (by volume) of the material back in 
a bucket!

I started out with a 40 or 50 pound bag that cost me about 40 bucks. I 
used a bit over half of the bag. I have a 5 gallon bucket about 7 inches 
deep with the swept up powder. I don't know if the used stuff will work 
if recycled, but I can't see why not.

I did wear a respirator and a face shield. I hosed myself off when I was 
done, and didn't have anything in my ears like I do when I use my 
pressure blaster (outside the cabinet) and regular media. I haven't 
noticed any grass dying where rain would have washed off residual soda, 
either.

So that is interesting and may well apply to jukeboxes - to do a dry way 
to remove stains and polish up mechanisms that are not greasy/oily...
