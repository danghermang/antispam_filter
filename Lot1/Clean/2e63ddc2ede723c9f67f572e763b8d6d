Subject:[Chelsea] DI MATTEO AND DROGBA NOMINATED [TOCFCWS]
[HS: Not mentioned is that Thibaut Courtois and Milan Lalkovic were
nominated in the young players shortlist]

Posted on: Mon 29 Oct 2012

Roberto Di Matteo has been shortlisted for FIFA's World Coach of the
Year 2012 award, while former Chelsea man Didier Drogba is nominated in
the players' category.

It follows our success in last season's Champions League, in which
Drogba scored our equalising goal and netted the winning penalty in the
shootout, an unlikely achievement before Di Matteo took the reins, when
we faced elimination from the competition in the early knockout rounds.

After lifting the European Cup in May, we have carried that form into
this season and sit a point clear at the top of the Barclays Premier
League.

Former manager Jose Mourinho, now with Real Madrid, is also listed in
the coaching category.

The full lists of nominees can be seen below, and the winners will be
announced on January 7, with votes taken from the coaches and captains
of national teams and international media representatives.

The following 23 men (in alphabetical order) are in contention for the
FIFA Ballon d'Or 2012:

Sergio Aguero (Argentina), Xabi Alonso (Spain),Mario Balotelli (Italy),
Karim Benzema (France), Gianluigi Buffon (Italy), Sergio Busquets
