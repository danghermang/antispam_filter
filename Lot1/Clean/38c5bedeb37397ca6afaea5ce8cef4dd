The prior reference to the archives recommending the Krylon mirror-glaze
are mostly from me.  For what it's worth the first Seeburg R emblem I
did was 9 years ago and it still looks very good.  Nice and shiny just
like the original.  The trick for good results is to remove all of the
old silver material without scratching the plastic.  A Bopsicle stick
works well for the tough spots, with a little Novus polish if needed.
Clean thoroughly, mask the sides and use several mist coats of the
mirror-glaze spray.
