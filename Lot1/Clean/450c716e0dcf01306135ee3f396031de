Subject:[meteorite-list] AD - Impactites, Mesosiderite,
	and some Fossils (Mammoth, Mastodon, others)
Hi List,

This week I have some unusual offerings in addition to my normal
meteorite offerings.  These are fossils collected from the world
famous "Bone Valley - Peace River" formation in south central Florida.
 Specimens include a large mammoth tooth, mammoth bones, mastodon
bones, extinct horse teeth, and some other bones that I cannot
positively identify.  There are also some Indian artifacts from the
pre-Calusa period that include scrapers, partial spearheads, and a
pottery shard.  I have grouped these pieces together into two lots.
