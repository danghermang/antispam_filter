That's a good summary. Of course, the exact numbers vary significantly 
depending on the product.

Here's a way to describe it that's easy to remember. Think of the cross 
section of a bathtub (view with a fixed-width font like Courier). It 
starts high at the faucet/drain end, but falls very quickly to the 
bottom. It then has a long, nearly flat bottom. Then at the far end, it 
rises back to the top, somewhat slower than it did at the faucet/drain end.

This is the "bathtub curve" as it is known to reliability engineers. The 
horizontal axis is time (in hours or even years). The height is the 
failure rate. High means very likely to fail; low means very unlikely to 
fail.

Something brand new (time=0, at the left end) has a very high failure 
rate. Maybe 10% of them don't work right out of the box! Hopefully, the 
company you bought it from tested it, and weeded out all these "infant 
mortality" failures so you won't see them. (Of course, this step is left 
out if you buy something cheap with no warranty or return options).

If it works for the first few weeks, you get into the low flat bottom of 
the bathtub. Any weak parts, careless assembly, or other problems have 
been weeded out. The product is likely to work for a long time.

As it gets old, the failure rate gradually starts to rise. This is the 
"wear out" portion of the curve. Just about *everything* has a wear-out 
mechanism. It could be months or years, depending on the type of 
product, how often you use it, how hot it gets, how hard you are 
stressing it, etc.

And, it depends on luck. :-) You could buy two identical products, and 
use them in identical applications. But one lasts a month, and one lasts 
10 years. It's just the luck of the draw.

You won't see the shape of this curve until you are buying 100's of 
something. If you carefully record exactly when each one fails, then you 
will see the shape of this curve. Most of the failures will either be 
from infant mortality, or wearout, with just a few random failures in 
between.
