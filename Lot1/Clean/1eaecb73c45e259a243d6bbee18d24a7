Subject:Re: [EVDL] Advancing Motor Timing pros/cons/ accel efficiency
I keep asking the same thing and everyone looks at me funny.  Seems like it
would be pretty simple (for folks that design these things).  I think some
racers have done it and keep it hush hush.

I don't think a basic timing adjustment would help in my case because I
have no top end (not enough voltage) AND no bottom end (too small of
motor).  I think the timing comes into play once you get the voltage up.
 Adjustable timing would help in my case since it would improve both the
starting torque and the high rpm power.
