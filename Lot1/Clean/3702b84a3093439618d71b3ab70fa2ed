Subject:[CT Birds] CROSSBILLS
Today at 3:00 up at Torrington Plazas Price-chopper, which is at a high 
elevation, from the car I saw 14 finchy birds fly over going west which i 
believe were CROSSBILLS. Of which species I don't know, but didn't see white in 
wings, but lighting was terrible, plus did not hear calls being in car. Pretty 
sure they were CBills though.
