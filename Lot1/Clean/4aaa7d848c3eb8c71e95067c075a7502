Subject:[meteorite-list] AD: Willamette---Appley Bridge---Park Forest---DAG
	412---Face on Mars Coins + Curiosity Rover
Hi List. For those interested...I have a small etched slice of the 
Willamette meteorite just listed on my Website. This comes with a rare 
vintage Willamette unused postcard. Included is a small oxide fragment from 
the original pit and a beautiful brass holder to display the Willamette 
meteorite and oxide fragment. I will also add a clear plastic easel to 
display your postcard. This is a sweet set of Willamette for those who have 
been wanting a piece of this difficult to acquire meteorite. All with well 
know and respected Provenance. Worth looking at.

Also I have my very last piece of Appley Bridge ending tomorrow on eBay. 
Also listed is an endcut of Park Forest, and a nice slice of DAG 412 a rare 
CK meteorite. Last---for those who collect coins and other Martian related 
item I have a set of "Face on Mars" coins with a new die cast model of the 
Curiosity Rover.
