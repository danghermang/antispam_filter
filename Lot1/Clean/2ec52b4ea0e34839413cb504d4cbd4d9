				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Tab=
let Overload!</strong></span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It=92s look=
ing like October will wind up being the month of brand new tablets.  Two of=
 the biggest names in computer technology, Apple and Microsoft, are both ei=
ther releasing or announcing new tablets in the last week and a half of thi=
s month.</span></p>
				<p>
					<img alt=3D"Surface Tablet" class=3D"alignnone size-full wp-image-3178=

				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">First is <s=
trong>Microsoft=92s Surface tablet</strong> which is set to go on sale Octo=
ber 26.  The Surface tablet will enter the market at $499 for its 32-gigaby=
te model, following up on Microsoft=92s promise during the summer to be =93=
comparable=94 to other tablets.  In comparison, Apple=92s new iPad will cos=
t you $499 for only 16-gigabytes of storage.  Unfortunately, one of the Sur=
face=92s most interesting and innovative features will cost you an extra $1=
20 unless you bundle it with the tablet purchase.  It would then only cost =
you $599 total.  The new feature is a full keyboard that doubles as a super=
-thin cover.  The cover easily flips back and forth between cover and keybo=
ard and it will come in a variety of colors, including red, white, magenta,=
 and cyan.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Surface=
 tablet will come equipped with Windows RT.  Windows RT is a scaled-down ve=
rsion of the new Windows 8 operating system, which is also set to be releas=
ed next week on the 26th.  Future versions of the Surface Tablet, set to be=
 released early next year, will operate with a full version of Windows 8 an=
d also include 64 and 128-gigabyte models.  Currently apps for the Surface =
will only be available through the Windows 8 app store.</span></p>
				<p>
					<img alt=3D"iPad Mini" class=3D"alignnone size-full wp-image-31789" he=
ight=3D"270" src=3D"http://imgsrv.worldstart.net/images/ct-images/2012/10/i=
pad-mini.jpg" title=3D"ipad-mini" width=3D"350" /></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Then there=
=92s the iPad=85 again.  This time its coming in a pint-sized version as Ap=
ple is expected to announce the new <strong>iPad Mini</strong> next week.  =
While Microsoft is trying to penetrate the higher-end tablet market, the iP=
ad mini looks to be Apple=92s attempt to penetrate the smaller, and cheaper=
, tablet market.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Many believ=
e the new iPad Mini will be approximately 7-inches in size (the current iPa=
d is nearly 10-inches) and come with a price tag of under $300.  Current he=
avy-hitting 7-inch tablets, such as Amazon=92s Kindle Fire and Google=92s N=
exus 7, both come with a cost of $199.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style=3D"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Apple typic=
ally announces its new products and then releases them for sale a couple we=
eks later.  If Apple continues this trend we could see the iPad Mini on sal=
e as early as the first week or two of November.</span></p>

astic earbuds, you've probably had the same gripes that I've had with 'em. =
Yeah, they're lightweight but the trouble is your ear has to be just the ri=
ght size to fit them. You have to jam them in your ear - hoping and praying=
 that they stay. But they always end up falling out... so you have to jam '=
em so far into your ear that they're REALLY uncomfortable. <img align=3D"ri=

"red"><em><strong>STEREO, have EXTRA BASS & are NOISE REDUCTION! </strong><=
/em></font><em>)</em> and are VERY comfortable.<br />
		<br />
		Let's face it, if earphones aren't comfortable, who <em>cares</em> how th=
ey sound, cuz you'll never wear 'em to ever find out! Well, these stream-li=
ned earphones really deliver not only on great sound but comfort too!<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Here's why these Stereo Earbuds work:</strong><br />
		<br />
		Each earpiece features a <font color=3D"blue"><strong><em>soft silicone e=
arpad</em></strong></font> and they will fit in almost any ear. They create=
 a slight suction - so when you place the earpiece in your ear it stays the=
re ...comfortably, and doesn't fall out!<br />
		<br />
		<font color=3D"#ff0000"><strong><em>These truly are a have a great set of=
 earphones that you can take where ever you go!</em></strong></font> In fac=
t, you can use these at your computer desk if you're working on your comput=
er late at night or early in the morning and you need to keep the sound dow=
n.<br />
		<br />
		And the cord is long enough (4 foot) without being too long so as to get =
tangled and in the way (another small point but something I've noticed as a=
 problem with other earphones I've tried!)<br />
		<br />
		And in case you were wonderin', this is the common plug (3.5 mm) that fit=
s into the front and your computer and most other audio devices, like porta=
ble radios, laptops, cd /dvd/mp3 players, iPods etc.<br />
