Subject:[CT Birds] Audubon's Warbler
11/11 Charlie Barnard just called me (8:40am) from Long Beach in Stratford to report he is looking at an AUDUBON'S Yellow- rumped Warbler, among 3 Myrtles. He noted bright yellow throat and it lacks a pale supercilium. It is in the dune shrubbery along the right edge of the parking lot about 75 yards down from the entrance booth. He'll try to obtain photos.
