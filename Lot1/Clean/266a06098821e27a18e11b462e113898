Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas

OK.  It's right that the open-circuit voltage means that nothing is
connected to the antenna (there is a formula linking the open-circuit
voltage to the radiation resistance for all small antennas).

 It important to consider the power efficiency for receiving antennas
and it is not really correct to say that only voltage matters.  What
matters is the signal power compared with the noise power, which takes
us into the new world of noise analysis.  We can look at this from a
radio-system point of view.

So if we look at the use of that ferrite antenna for receiving at 1
MHz, a typical edge-of-coverage field strength for an AM broadcast is
1 mV/m, which gives a power-density of -56 dBm/msq.  A lossless
antenna has a capture area of 3.lambda^2/8pi, as we have already seen,
which is 10728 m^2, or +40.3 dBmsq.  Thus a notional lossless antenna
would capture a power of -16 dBm at the edge of coverage, while our
ferrite rod antenna with its radiation efficiency of -90 dB will
capture 90 dB less than that, i.e. -106 dBm.

Now, turning to the thermal noise floor, the number to remember from
the well known kTB formula is -204 dBW for each Hz of bandwidth (there
is a temperature close to 290 deg. Kelvin that makes that figure
exact).  For a 10 kHz bandwidth the noise floor is 40 dB higher, -164
dBW, which is -134 dBm.  Thus we can see that this ferrite rod antenna
gives us a signal-to-noise ratio of 134-106 dB, or 28 dB.  A cheap
front-end for a transistor radio can be made with a noise figure of 8
dB, therefore we have a reasonable 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio for our
transistor radio at the edge of the coverage area of its local AM
broadcast station.  This rough calculation shows why ferrite rod
antennas are acceptably good for transistor radios, and why without
the ferrite the radiation efficiency and power-capture of a
similarly-sized coil would be inadequate.
