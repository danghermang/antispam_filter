Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Mills Zephyr Amplifier Question
=0A=0A=0APeter, I assume you mean "tube" type thing, not "tune." The tube t=
hing sounds like one of the single or multi electrolytic can capacitor has =
failed. Normally, if the amp was rebuilt just prior to your purchase, the f=
irst items to be replaced in a rebuild would be all=C2=A0the electrolytic c=
aps, then all paper caps, then out of tolerance resistors (probably all the=
 resistors=C2=A0in something from the 1930s). I wonder how long ago it was =
rebuilt? Of course, just because smoke appears to be coming from a componen=
t, does not mean that particular component is bad, but could be another com=
ponent is bad causing the other to smoke, ie. like a failed power resistor.=
 You should remove the amp and closely inspect underneath for any burn spot=
s in the components. Look closely underneath where the black tube is wired.=

er Question=0A  =0AMy Mills Zephyr amplifier (MCP 2802 or 2806 - which was =
rebuilt when I bought it) has started acting weird.=C2=A0 =0A=0AIt played f=
ine for several years and now it heats up, the sound cuts out, and a long b=
lack cylindrical tune type thing (sorry can=E2=80=99t figure out what it=C2=
=A0 it is called) heats up and starts smoking.=C2=A0 Could it be just that =
this particular part of the amp has gone bad?=C2=A0 Looking at my schematic=
s I think=C2=A0 it might be a choke or a flasher but I am not sure.=C2=A0 K=
ind of looks like a black waxy or plastic tube.=C2=A0 After leaving it for =
a while it started playing sound but then it did it again.=0A=0ACould this =
part just go bad or is something else causing it?=C2=A0 Do you know where I=
 can get one of these?=0A=0AI could take the amp out and take a picture and=
 post it if that helps.=0A=0AThanks.=0A=0APeter=0A=0A______________________=
