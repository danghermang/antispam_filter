	Published(Intra-RIR Transfer Policy Proposal)
Last month I brokered a sale of legacy ARIN space to a customer in the APNIC 
region using the Inter-RIR transfer policies in place in both regions.
As we know, ARIN has the lion's share of IPv4 space, and this proposal would 
open the door to this source of address space for buyers in Europe.
For sellers of RIPE space, this proposal provides another market or two to 
sell into.
I believe a viable global transfer market in IPv4 addresses will assist in 
what appears to be a lengthy transition to IPv6 by making available 
underutilized address space and equalizing transition pressure around the 
world.

I support the proposal.

On this page, it would appear that the phrase «Within the RIPE NCC
service region,» is to be added at the beginning of the second paragraph
in section 5.5.

However, that phrase is not found in the «new text» box on this page.
That must be an omission?

As a general feedback to the draft document page, not specific to
2012-03, I find it preferable if the «original text» and «new text»
boxes are made as small as absolutely possible. If the paragraphs that
aren't touched by the proposal are kept outside of those boxes, it is
much easier to spot the actual changes made, than it is if you include
the entire original and new section side-by-side (as is the case with
2012-03's draft document).

Taking it one step further, it would be even better if those paragraphs
that have only change by a small amount (i.e., aren't completely
rewritten) have the actual changes highlighted, e.g., using
strikethrough for deleted text, and coloured text for added text (such
as the "Within the RIPE NCC service region" added by this proposal).

The changes indicated in sections 6.0 and 6.3 at
https://www.ripe.net/ripe/policies/proposals/2009-03/draft are two
examples I like.

In any case, I support this policy proposal.
