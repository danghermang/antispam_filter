Hi Braun As,

Are your file or email archives a black hole? Do you even archive?
If not, you might have a black hole in a black hole. Do you have
funding for your archiving project? If not, you have a black hole in
a black hole in a... you get the idea.

Email is embedded in your business processes. It contains vital
business intelligence, but most of us squirrel it away, or struggle
to cope with multiple PST files and unobtainable information. We
treat archiving as a tedious compliance problem, if we do it at all.

On the other hand, an interactive archive can improve productivity,
help you make decisions by unifying your data sources, give power
back to admins, and simplify support. Stuart Walters, IT Director of
Taylor Wessing is joining us to tell us how he built his interactive
archive, and the benefit he gets from it.

Joining Stuart in the studio will be the Reg's Tim Phillips, Orlando
Scott-Cowley from Mimecast - the experts at creating interactive
archives - and Tony Lock of Freeform Dynamics, who has been nagging
about this for years. Effective archiving is a problem we all struggle
to solve, so join us to hear how you can fix it, what the benefits are
to users, the business and IT, and how you can secure budget to build
your interactive archive.
