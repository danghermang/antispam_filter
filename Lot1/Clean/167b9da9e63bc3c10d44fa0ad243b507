Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] 1/2-wave vertical really needs a ground
	plane?
Ward

Yes, well I was being a stickler but I was using 'dipole' in more of
the original sense of equal and opposite charges, as is the case with
a centre-fed dipole.  I guess things like a Windom are also described
as dipoles now so we must go with the flow.

The main point was that a vertical dipole that does not connect to the
ground does not need ground wires.
