Transfer of PA space is already allowed under current policy.

There's no explicit *prohibition* of transfer of PI space, there's
simply no policy that regulates it. My guess it's simply not there
because there was no need for it in the past.

The RIPE NCC does not have any preference in the matter. The RIPE NCC
simply does what the RIPE Community (that's you and me!) tells it to do.

That's precisely what you would have to do in order to allow for
transfer of PI space. I'd suggest you review the following pages, which
document the RIPE Policy Development Process:

http://www.ripe.net/ripe/policies
http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-500
http://www.ripe.net/ripe/policies/policy-development-process-glossary

Next, write up a proposal and submit it. Then the Address Policy WG can
discuss it to determine whether or not there is consensus for it.

Best regards,
