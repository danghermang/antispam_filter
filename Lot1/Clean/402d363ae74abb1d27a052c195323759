Currently it looks the cheapest option to buy 3 kitchen 0.1c accurate =

LED thermometers (for the price of 1 thermocouple resistor WTF!) and =

modify them.
I will get one and see if whats in there - a pic and a small cct board I =

guess - if I can get the pic out without damaging it I can dump the code =

and see how it works and may be able to extract the temperature info one =

way or another.
Calibration is a strange one - what does one calibrate against freezing =

and boiling are rarely where you think they should be!
