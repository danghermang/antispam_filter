Subject:[Coral-List] How insignificant?
Re: Pseudoscience / Eugene Shinn

Dear Eugene,

That's a very important point you raise about increases in CO2 having
"only" an arithmetic progression on the world's temperature; so, assuming
it's true (has anyone double checked Arrhenius' experiments?), what
implication do you think that has for the restrictions of carbon emission
through legislation?

It may be worth defining exactly what "insignificant" means e.g to corals
