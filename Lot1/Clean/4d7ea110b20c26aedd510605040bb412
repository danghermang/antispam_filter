Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Nominate Little Egret at WTP on Birdline
HI Mike thanks for advising me of this discussion, I must admit that I have long been an advocate of resurrecting the taxon "immaculata" as being the Australian representative of E. garzetta. The reason for my holding this opinion being that, over my many years of regular acquaintance with Little Egrets in the Pilbara, I never once saw (at least amongst all of the ones seen well enough to check such details) one single bird that did NOT show yellow on the soles of the feet - this in direct contrast to the entirely black toes of "nigripes", a taxon with which I was, at that time, already familiar.  This characteristic was present at all stages. Even on  - green-legged - juvenile birds the soles still showed up as being of a slightly "more yellow" shade, with this character becoming more obvious as the leg-colour darkened and finally "blackened" into that of an adult bird. In adults, this yellow areas seemed to vary in neither extent nor in shade of colour, whether they were in
  breeding plumage or not. I will admit, however, that none of the birds I saw there ever displayed the reddened facial skin colouration of the "courtship blush" and so I cannot comment on whether, over that period, the soles of the feet would, correspondingly, redden, or not - as is the case in the nominate form. I would, however, suspect that there is a good possibility that they would do so. In fact the illustration in "The Herons Handbook" - Hancock & Kushlan, does indicate this as being the case. Such "courtship" reddening" is however a "short-lived" event and altho'(if the soles do in fact attain that colour) birds seen in this state could easily be taken as having "all-dark" toes: I suspect that this factor would not account for all of the "Top End" observations/comments. I would, nevertheless, be interested to hear what was the corresponding colouration of the facial-skin, eye etc. when the toes were noted as being "completely and uniformly dark".
As to the basic query - what sub-species of Little Egret is present in the "Top End"- well that obviously comes down to whether one accepts the taxon "immaculata" or not. If one does then I would consider that there is a good case for these birds being of the form "nigripes". I'm afraid that gleaning details of the distinctions between the two taxa will be difficult. "Submergence" (of "immaculata") will have resulted, as is usual in such instances, in the indiscriminate "lumping/combining" of records; as such the process of sorting out which comments refer to which taxon will, now, be all the more difficult.
Personally, I would not be too surprised to find that "nigripes" has indeed turned up in the "Top End", after all there are already records of the far more geographically distant - nominate - form arriving in Australia. There are, also, undoubted "pressures" on many wetland areas within Indonesia, which would probably provide a sufficient "push-factor" for their "local" birds to move away from traditional breeding areas and to attempt to relocate wherever they can. (Why not Australia?) Whether, if this is the case, they will be able to maintain this extension/invasion , be "pushed-out", or "integrated" into the "immaculata" populations is an interesting prospect. 

Regards, John

HANZAB reminds us that formerly there were two subspecies of Little Egret in A'asia, nigripes and immaculata. Some of us would prefer that situation restored as there are differences between populations, which may include feet colour.

The thing that made me wonder about any geographic variation in the soles
of the nigripes feet in breeding plumage was that all of the Top End birds
I'd managed to get to lift their feet had (completely and uniformly) dark
soles, where HANZAB says the soles in breeding birds are 'straw-yellow',
which seems reasonable given the colour in non-breeding. It may be that the
HANZAB reference is a bit of a red herring?
