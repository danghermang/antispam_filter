Subject:Re: [MG] List organization (was International E-Democracy Talk)
Yes, I admin this list, but as we're all about collaboration, I don't want =
to dictate the answer. What works for others?

My suggestion of an Announce list was to hopefully avoid the scenario Nicol=
as brought up: over-cross-posting. If there is an announce list that does n=
ot allow discussion, it would only produce one message per week (or however=
 often meetings are), and thus may be allowed to cross-post into other list=
s. Discussion of the topics and logistics of meetings could be covered on t=
he existing metagov list for now, unless it becomes overly distracting from=
 the topical discussions.


P.S. Although I am proposing a cross-posting list, I can see how it would n=
ot be welcome on dev lists. Dev lists should be limited to development, and=
 are usually complimented by another more general discussion list, where th=
ese announcements may be more welcome. So, Nicolas, while we shouldn't cros=
s-post to adhocracy-dev, would info@liqd.net be an appropriate alternative?
