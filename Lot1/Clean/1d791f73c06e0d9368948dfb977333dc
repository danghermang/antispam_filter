Subject:Re: [child_lit] And while I'm here
Thanks Leda - it is a delight. I've no idea from here what the WSI is, but
this peon to the book makes it okay with me, at least for now. I'm a
collector like him - but I've never actually counted the books in the house,
or the ones I have read over a life time... Virginia

There's  a wonderful article by Joe Queenan in the WSJ (no, I do not
regularly read the WSJ. Surprised?) that I bet everybody will love.
