Subject:Re: [child_lit] An African-American friend asks who read what?
My reading from childhood may be atypical from that of other list members.
Then again, what is typical besides "the school canon;" where we go to
school determines the canon, too, I believe. My parents were both readers;
my dad was also a writer.

I did not read Tolkien or CS Lewis until adulthood.  I was an army brat, so
I was reading Madeline, Alice in Wonderland, Anatole, Babar, Tin-Tin, and
other books in French, and all four of the Winnie the Pooh clothbound books
in English, for the time I lived there. When we returned to the US,  I read
my mom's copies of Caddie Woodlawn, Journeys through Bookland, Nancy Drew,
Cherry Ames, & The Bobbsey Twins. I also read my dad's Hardy Boys and Doc
Savage books. Mad Magazine was a staple. I read Greek, Roman, and Norse m
ythology. I read a set of Encyclopedia Britannica because a friend of my
mom stored it at my house. I read The Tall Book of Fairy Tales which Garth
Williams illustrated. I read Ian Fleming's books after seeing Sean Connery
as Bond and after reading Sol Weinstein's parodies. The Diary of Anne
Frank, Carry on Mr. Bowditch, Charlotte's Web, The Wind in the Willows I
read as a child. Because my mother said not to, I read The Carpetbaggers. I
also read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich because it was in the house
when I was about 15. Because my dad and Phyllis Rosenteur shared an agent,
I read An Affair of the Flesh (which I continue to reread, as I find it
hysterically funny). Animal Farm & 1984 I read in school along with Great
Expectations (and I could not read Dickens again until adulthood) and some
of Shakespeare's works. I read e.e. cummings and EA Poe in school as well
and then on my own.

We moved a lot when I was a kid and I don't remember much about libraries
in schools or towns until we got to Winston-Salem, NC. The bookmobile came
to the "Old Ladies' Home" so my brother and I went to that and they started
carrying a limited amount of children's books (novels) for us. My granddad
read National Geographic, so I did as well.

Many of the books that my children read as children (the above mentioned
Tolkien & Lewis) I did not read until adulthood. I devoured books by
many authors
such as Asimov, Bradbury, F. Herbert, L'Engle, Le Guin, TH White, Yolen,
Zelazny, after I found out about them in a children's literature course. I
read Zolotow, Seuss, Dragonwagon, Coville, and many others to and with my
children.
