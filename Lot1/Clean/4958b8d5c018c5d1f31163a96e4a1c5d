Subject:[Dixielandjazz] North East US Jazz Musicians
For those of us who have listened to OKOM Radio, it appears that 
Hurricane Sandy has taken out OKOM Radio along with the Tradjass Mailing 
list.  Hopefully it is a matter of power loss and not substantial 
damage.  However, I suspect the restoration of Radio OKOM does not have 
a high priority.  Do any of you East Coast DJML members who have 
regained power and/or their internet connection know the status of any 
of the OKOM gang?  Clarinetist Joe Licari has reported in on Facebook 
from somewhere in New York having downed trees, but no major damage to 
his property.
