> Subject: [child_lit] OT,	but you're the smartest group I know. Possibly meaning of Waterloo
> 
> So, just putting a postcard from Waterloo, Belgium on my daughter's desk and I know the Flemish pronounce it Water-low.  It just hit me, that being pronounced that way makes it the Flemish word for water (um, water) and the French word for water (l'eau).  
> 
> I do not know exactly what was being spoken in that part of Belgium in 1815 (was it even Belgium?  I should know this) and I'm wondering if that's where the name came from.  
> 
> O' wise and wonderful (and really international) list, any ideas?
> 
> Okay, back to getting my house ready for Thanksgiving (it's WAY too early, which is why I'm missing NCTE this year) and I'll stop being distracted by shiny squirrels.
