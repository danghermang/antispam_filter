Nick,
How come you always end up in such strange company on the away trips?

> So I'm on the plane from Donetsk to Istanbul(don't ask) and I'm next to a rather dull looking guy in a suit. In the row in front are two of those stunning women you see a lot of in Ukraine, wearing the spray-on jeans that seem to be popular. After a while it becomes clear he's with them and when the trolley comes round he pays for all 3 meals and goes to sit with them. He doesn't seem old enough to be their father but do businessmen really take TWO prostitutes with them on trips?
