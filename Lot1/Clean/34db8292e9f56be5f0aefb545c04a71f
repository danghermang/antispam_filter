Subject:Re: [child_lit] porn spam
thanks, kathy! One of the addresses generating porn spam was subscribed to the list, and I took the liberty of unsubscribing it (following that with a note to the person informing him/her why I had done so and suggesting he/she examine his/her computer for an email worm before resubscribing. 


However, other spams were generated from other addresses--which seemed to be hotmail addresses, not subscribed to child_lit. 


Funny, indeed, how the mind works. I remembered a thread I think it was on this list not too long ago about some vindictive, litigious character who had sought revenge after receiving a bad review (I think it was). 


Anyway, please continue to forward these provocative posts to me and I'll see if I can make them stop. 


Best, 


M

Agreeing with others: not a problem to hit the DELETE key for awhile as you folks cope with the priority issues. Take as long as you need. So glad to know you are safe. 

Perhaps this would give you a welcome laugh? I marveled at how clever the spamers were becoming (using the subject line of a post I had sent to Child-lit recently meant I would open the email - and that the subject would not trigger a spam alert). I was so impressed with the sneakiness, I read the moderately offensive Spam (which listed the young woman's voluptuous body parts) to my husband. As I looked up, he commiserated by asking if I could forward the Spam to him so he could study it in more detail! haha ....er, no, my dear :-)

Quite a bit of central New Jersey is under-water and power is out throughout a fair part of the state. I know that some of you are receiving annoying and improper emails, for which I am dreadfully sorry, but as unwelcome as this is, it does not rise to the level of magnitude that will concern University personnel right at the moment. If someone would be kind enough to forward one of the emails to me, I will see what I can do to put a stop to them.
