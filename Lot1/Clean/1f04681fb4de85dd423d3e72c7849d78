To melt away the blues of Sandy and Athena and to welcome a beautiful birding weather weekend ahead!
Bet you sing along : )


Bohemian Waxody

"Is this a waxwing? 
In this crabapple tree? 
We're in a bird-slide, no denying reailty.

Open your eyes, look up to the skies, and see
I'm just a birder
I need no sympathy
Cause it's waxwing come, waxwing go, 

Finches high, buntings low

Anywhere the wind blows doesnt really matter to meeeeee
...Unless its Northeast.

(interlude)

Mama
Just killed a man
Got too close to a snowy owl
Pushed him right into the foul
WATERS
of Lake Michigan. 
And now I've gone and thrown his scope away

OWL,
OoooOOOOOoooooh
Didn't mean to make you fly
But if you're not back again this time tommorrow,
Carry on, carry on
Photos do not matter. 

Too late
The shrike has come
Bit a mouse right on the spine
Birders cursing all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and chase this gyr

FALCON
OooooOOOOoooooh
I don't wanna die
But if I do I wanna be fed to gulls

(Musical interlude)

I see a little silhouetto of a bird
In a tree, in a tree, will you chase green-breasted mango? 
STARLING FLOCKS AND LIGHTENING VERY VERY FRIGHTENING ME
Bombycilla! Bombycilla!
Bombycilla! Bombycilla!
Bombycilla garrulus!- MAGNIFICOOOOOOOOOO

I'm a just a birder. Nobody loves me. 
He's a just birder! From the town of Milwaukee! 
Spare him a scope for the bird we shall see! 

Easy come, easy go, will school let me go?
Twitch rare birds? NO! We will not let you go!
Let him go!
Twitch rare birds? We will not let you go! 
Let him go!
Twitch rare birds? We will not let you go!
Let me go!
Will not let you go! 
Let me go!
Will not let you go! oooooooooooh
No! No! No! No! No!
Bombycilla, bombycilla, bombycilla let me go! 

Beezlebub has a grosbeak put aside for me...for me... FOR ME!!!!

doo doo doodooo doo dooo doooo dooo

So you think you stop me and shit in my eyes? 
So you think you can leave me and fly?
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh birdy
Can you listen to me birdy?
Just gotta get out, just gotta get birds for this year

(musical interlude)

Birding really matters...anyone can see...
Birding really matters....to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
