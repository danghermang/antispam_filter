Subject:[MG] Requirements in regard to split opinion formation
Hi Marc,

Although I'm not a member of the Meinungsfindungstool working group, I
have a personal concern with what you're working on.  Specifically it
involves the problem of "split consensus" as Thomas von der Elbe has
called it, or "split opinion formation" in your own terms.

But first I have some questions.  Do you have time to answer?

I try to picture what you describe (pardon my ASCII):

             ....
          ..........  M
        ..............   ....
       .......................
       ......................
        .............   ....
          ..........
             ...

            | T1  |  | T2  |
            |     |  |     |

    |    S                   |

     M  Opinion in formation
     T  Competing tools
     S  Common standards, practices,
        databases, and so forth


Here T1 and T2 are competing tools for the purpose of opinion forming.
A user may choose T1 or T2.  But regardless of the choice (say it is
T2), the user will remain part of the same overall opinion forming
process (M).  So he/she may continue to work with other users who make
different choices (T1).  This technical freedom of choice is made
possible by the common standards, practices and/or databases (S) that
are shared between the competing tools.  Is this picture correct?
