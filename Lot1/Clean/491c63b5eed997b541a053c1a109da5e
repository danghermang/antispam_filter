When Clattenburg is announced (not tried etc) not guilty, it is evident 
Chelsea did not check the players stories well enough in advance and 
published the complaints too soon. Thus Chelsea have brought disrepute to 
the game and must pay.

Punising a ref is impossible - thus the opposite must be found out. And 
the penalty to the players and to the club must be severe enough that it 
does not happen again.

I admit to be prejudiced against the FA. Some might call it common sense.
