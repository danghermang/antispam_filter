I agree but we haven't reached that point yet, and as long as these two graphs:

https://www.inex.ie/noncms/img/inex-lan1-ipv4-20121107.png

... differ from each other by a factor of 1000, it's unrealistic to say that:

- ipv6 is a viable alternative to IPv4 right now
- ipv4 is deprecated / legacy / historic / whatever

I know that you're not saying this, but other people on this mailing list
are.  Don't get me wrong either: I'd love to see much more ipv6 penetration
and wider deployment, but we are where we are and we need to deal with
policies which are relevant to people today.

Incidentally, if you strip out the top 10% of the v6 talkers from those
graphs above, the ipv6 graph drops by two orders of magnitude. :-|
