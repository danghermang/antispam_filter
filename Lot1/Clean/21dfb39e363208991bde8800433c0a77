OPPORTUNITY UPDATE:  Survey Drives Of Local Area - sols 3105-3110,
Oct. 18, 2012-Oct. 23, 2012:

Opportunity is continuing a local area survey around the location called
"Matijevic Hill" (named in honor of Jake Matijevic) at the inboard edge
of Cape York on the rim of Endeavour Crater.

The rover performed three survey drives on Sols 3105, 3107 and 3110
(Oct. 18, 20, and 23, 2012), driving first west, then southwest, and
then southeast, totaling 226 feet (69 meters). Each drive was preceded
by the collection of targeted imagery and then followed by taking a
360-degree Navigation camera (Navcam) panorama. On Sol 3109 (Oct. 22,
2012), an atmospheric argon measurement was collected by the Alpha
Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS). The plan ahead is to conduct more
survey drives around this location.

As of Sol 3110 (Oct. 23, 2012), the solar array energy production was
575 watt-hours with an atmospheric opacity (Tau) of 0.654 and a solar
array dust factor of 0.619.

Total odometry is 21.87 miles (35,189.68 meters).
