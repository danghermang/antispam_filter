Subject:[bcp] Caution: AD-Like Content! bike shop sale this fri-sun
As a spot of rain spoiled our run at Sunday's Swap Meet and finale at the Bike Expo, we've decided to follow up with a FALL SALE at both Trophy Bikes locations:

3131 Walnut (starts 8am friday) and 712 N. 2nd St. (starts noon friday) ... 

every molecule of merch will undergo a reduction in price ... most notably a clutch of SALSA 2012 models (at our northern liberties store) 

the, er, "sales event" continues until the clock strikes 5 on Sunday, 4 November, at which time our prices rise majestically back to their usual sensible levels.

thanks for reading and riding;

-- mcget / trophy bikes phila




please pass this on to any relevant lists read by budget-minded cyclists....
