Subject:[Birding-Aus] Banded Pied Oystercatcher
Hi All,

 

   I have a photograph taken on Griffith Island (Port Fairy) of a banded
Pied Oystercatcher with a number of bands on it.

On one leg there are 3 bands:    black/white/red    and on the other a
silver band.

 

Anyone interested in seeing the photo or have any info re the bands please.

 

Happy birding

Marlene.
