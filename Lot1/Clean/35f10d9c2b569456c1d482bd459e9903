That whole association of 1015's and Rock 'n Roll never made sense to me. B=
y the time Rock took off in 1956 most of those 24 selection relics were in =
warehouses.

back in the 80's when there were still a lot of operators on Tenth ave,=A0 =
one of the topics was "what was the first real R&R juke.=A0 The Seeburg "K"=
 was my choice and after some argument, other saw the point.

Interestingly, only one op admitted to still having 1015's out by the mid-f=
ifties, that was in Jersey City at a small candy/soda shop.=20

As an aside, this first time I saw one in-person was at the men's departmen=
t in Bloomingdale's here in NYC in fall 1969.=A0 It was set up and running =
free play. The tone arm was a crystal retrofit and the machine ran 78's.=A0=
 On one visit the front door was slightly open and I opened it a little mor=
e. The machine was dusty inside and probably had not had any rebuilding. =
=A0 It sounded OK at first visit, but as the months wore on the stylus was =
not changed and well.....

The store also had an R, a Wurlitzer 1800 and a PFEAIU -all free.=A0 I aske=
d about where they got them and was given some display director's number, H=
e in-turn told me they had been bought fro "Mr Nichol's Jukeboxes" on First=
 ave near the 59th St bridge.

My father and I went to the store, but it was closed and empty.=A0 Years la=
ter I was told "Mr Nichol's" real name was Rosenberg and that he had sold a=
 bunch of wiped down machines and promptly closed up shop leaving the clien=
ts up shits creek for repairs.
