Subject:[EVDL] Charging flooded lead, revisited
Vitals: 144v pack, 8 v/batt.
Concern: not properly equalized for 2 ys., 8 mo. 
Status:  they've been put on 35 A, 176v, and won't go past 171.  Regarding individual batts., they've been taking turns having voltages go to just over 10, then they'll fall back down, corresponding with hygrometer improvements.
Meanwhile, 3 batts. Staying at 8.7 v or so.  (hygrometer to follow).  Okay experts, will I find they're toast, or resting at a higher SOC than the rest?
Appreciatively,
