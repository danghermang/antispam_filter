Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] crystal radios, loop antennas,

It's a free country.  You don't have to buy it.  And you didn't ask
how close that crystal set has to be to the transmitter before
anything is audible :).  But my suggestion would be to buy one and try
it.

By the way, what part does the aerial wire sloping down the garden
have in that system? . . . a casual reader might think you have been
left looking foolish :) . . . something which I would strongly
deprecate, naturally.
