Ed,
Two "secrets" to keeping that motor working--
1. Keep all three sections "balanced".
2. Oil the motor shaft where it enters the motor with a drop or two of 20 w=
t. every year or so--

Rob -

In the '80's there were several people who owned so-called "antique shops"
in Manhattan. I remember one on York Avenue & 16th street (I think) that
claimed he was a jukebox restorer -- NOT! He had a W1015 that had a price
tag of $10,500 on the front glass. The machine on the outside looked
spotless but when I opened the front door it looked like WW III -- dirt,
gunk, grunge, grease -- you name it.=A0 This was obviously a ripoff and
anyone who had a 1/2 of a brain would have noticed this mess. I later
learned that this guy was a shady character and he soon became persona non
grata amongst jukebox enthusiasts. I remember Al Simon on 10th Avenue &
43rd (I think) and I purchased my Seeburg SS160 from them in 1978. Still
have it and it is a real workhorse -- great sound from a solid state 50
watt amplifier. And believe it or not, the top motor works perfectly and
rotates every 25 seconds. There are very few left with working motors...
