Swappiness is still a touchy subject but 4Gb of RAM in a typical PC is
quite enough - if your swap partition isn't on a SSD or other high IOPS
device try:

sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=0

People say you shouldn't really manually mess around with this on modern
kernels but it can make a difference (your system is wasting time
pre-emptively swapping out to a slow I/O magnetic disk). You can always
use sar/collectl to monitor actual memory and swap usage for a
quantitative analysis to determine if it actually speeds up your system.
To make any permanent changes edit /etc/sysctl.conf.

Cheers
