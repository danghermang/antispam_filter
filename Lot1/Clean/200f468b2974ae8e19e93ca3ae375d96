Subject:[h-cost] red bridal gowns and book author

Yes, Mrs. Simeti does not have a scholarly background, but as someone who has been up to her eyebrows in 12th-century Sicily for over a decade now I can tell you that she has read a lot of the basic background information.  This is what makes her books so confusing.  Anything I might use from her books is double-checked; hence, my question about red bridal dresses.

I, too, am reading, on-line, that medieval wedding dresses were simply one's best dress.  There are also the statements that blue was a preferred color but without quoting sources.
