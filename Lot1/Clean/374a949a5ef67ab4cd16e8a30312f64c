Actually, one could argue the case for at least half of Iain M. Banks'
Culture novels, particularly _Excession_, _Look to Windward_, and
_Surface Detail_, in all three of which major characters are
artificially-hyperintelligent[1] starship minds.  (As a matter of fact,
in _Excession_, the actual *biological* characters are in the minority.)



[1]  'Artificial intelligence' just doesn't seem ... *sufficient* to
describe a GSV Mind.  I'm not entirely certain that even 'artificial
hyperintelligence' is.
