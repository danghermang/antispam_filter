Subject:Re: [CT Birds] A Question About Merlins
Joe,

I checked the Raptor Population Index charts for Lighthouse Point Park and =
was disappointed to see that the Merlin (ML) chart was not available.=A0 Ho=
wever, over at HawkCount monthly summaries, a quick look at this year and "=
Previous Season Comparison" indicated not much change for ML.=A0 Other than=
 huge numbers (1000) during those couple of glorious early 1990s years, we'=
ve been seeing them in the 200-600 range each Fall season.=A0 Again at Hawk=
count, Quaker Ridge is showing a slight up-tick (100+ vs 60+) over the past=
 5 or 10 seasons.=A0 A quick check over at ML-Central (Fire Island) shows o=
nly the past decade, and they've been statistically steady at 1000+ per sea=
son.=A0 =


So based on this relatively small (I'm not joking) sample (3 sites in or ne=
ar CT, tens of thousands of observation hours, decades of data), I'm not se=
eing anything real special for an increase in autumnal MLs.=A0 =


I'd be MUCH more interested in hearing if people are seeing Merlins more in=
 July, rather than October.=A0 In July of 2011, I found a freshly killed "B=
lue Jack" male on Rte 42 near Beacon Cap in Bethany.=A0 I don't think I've =
ever had ML in May-July, in CT, before or after.=A0 =


The first one to find a ML nest in CT gets a prize!=A0 =

I was checking out Madison's Bauer Park for the first time and spotted a fe=
male merlin atop a tall conifer. I seem to be seeing merlins much more this=
 decade than in the past. Weren't they once much more uncommon? Do annual b=
ird counts show their sightings going up?
