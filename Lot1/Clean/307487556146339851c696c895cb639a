Subject:Re: [child_lit] Children's books inspired by specific artefacts on
 public display in museums (anywhere in the world)?
Hi All,

Zoe asked ...
I'm working on a list of children's books inspired by specific artefacts on public display in museums [...] I'd love to hear if anyone has any more books they think could be added to the list.

Orhan Pamuk's Museum of Innocence definitely is not a children's book at all, but may still be of interest since the inspiration is reversed, i.e. he built a real museum http://www.masumiyetmuzesi.org/ to reference the fictional museum in his novel.

Cheers,

Tim.
