QUESTION 3: Law Proposed by Initiative Petition
Medical Use of Marijuana

Do you approve of a law summarized below, on which no vote was taken by the=
 Senate or the House of Representatives on or before May 1, 2012?

[http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/ele12/ballot_questions_12/quest_3.htm]
SUMMARY

As required by law, summaries are written by the State Attorney General, an=
d the statements describing the effect of a =93yes=94 or =93no=94 vote are =
written jointly by the State Attorney General and the Secretary of the Comm=
onwealth.

This proposed law would eliminate state criminal and civil penalties for th=
e medical use of marijuana by qualifying patients. To qualify, a patient mu=
st have been diagnosed with a debilitating medical condition, such as cance=
r, glaucoma, HIV-positive status or AIDS, hepatitis C, Crohn=92s disease, P=
arkinson=92s disease, ALS, or multiple sclerosis. The patient would also ha=
ve to obtain a written certification, from a physician with whom the patien=
t has a bona fide physician-patient relationship, that the patient has a sp=
ecific debilitating medical condition and would likely obtain a net benefit=
 from medical use of marijuana.

The proposed law would allow patients to possess up to a 60-day supply of m=
arijuana for their personal medical use. The state Department of Public Hea=
lth (DPH) would decide what amount would be a 60-day supply. A patient coul=
d designate a personal caregiver, at least 21 years old, who could assist w=
ith the patient=92s medical use of marijuana but would be prohibited from c=
onsuming that marijuana. Patients and caregivers would have to register wit=
h DPH by submitting the physician=92s certification.

The proposed law would allow for non-profit medical marijuana treatment cen=
ters to grow, process and provide marijuana to patients or their caregivers=
. A treatment center would have to apply for a DPH registration by (1) payi=
ng a fee to offset DPH=92s administrative costs; (2) identifying its locati=
on and one additional location, if any, where marijuana would be grown; and=
 (3) submitting operating procedures, consistent with rules to be issued by=
 DPH, including cultivation and storage of marijuana only in enclosed, lock=
ed facilities.

A treatment center=92s personnel would have to register with DPH before wor=
king or volunteering at the center, be at least 21 years old, and have no f=
elony drug convictions. In 2013, there could be no more than 35 treatment c=
enters, with at least one but not more than five centers in each county. In=
 later years, DPH could modify the number of centers.

The proposed law would require DPH to issue a cultivation registration to a=
 qualifying patient whose access to a treatment center is limited by financ=
ial hardship, physical inability to access reasonable transportation, or di=
stance. This would allow the patient or caregiver to grow only enough plant=
s, in a closed, locked facility, for a 60-day supply of marijuana for the p=
atient=92s own use.

DPH could revoke any registration for a willful violation of the proposed l=
aw. Fraudulent use of a DPH registration could be punished by up to six mon=
ths in a house of correction or a fine of up to $500, and fraudulent use of=
 a registration for the sale, distribution, or trafficking of marijuana for=
 non-medical use for profit could be punished by up to five years in state =
prison or by two and one-half years in a house of correction.

The proposed law would (1) not give immunity under federal law or obstruct =
federal enforcement of federal law; (2) not supersede Massachusetts laws pr=
ohibiting possession, cultivation, or sale of marijuana for nonmedical purp=
oses; (3) not allow the operation of a motor vehicle, boat, or aircraft whi=
le under the influence of marijuana; (4) not require any health insurer or =
government entity to reimburse for the costs of the medical use of marijuan=
a; (5) not require any health care professional to authorize the medical us=
e of marijuana; (6) not require any accommodation of the medical use of mar=
ijuana in any workplace, school bus or grounds, youth center, or correction=
al facility; and (7) not require any accommodation of smoking marijuana in =
any public place.

The proposed law would take effect January 1, 2013, and states that if any =
of its part were declared invalid, the other parts would stay in effect.

WHAT YOUR	 VOTE WILL DO

A YES VOTE would enact the proposed law eliminating state criminal and civi=
l penalties related to the medical use of marijuana, allowing patients meet=
ing certain conditions to obtain marijuana produced and distributed by new =
state-regulated centers or, in specific hardship cases, to grow marijuana f=
or their own use.

A NO VOTE would make no change in existing laws.

ARGUMENTS

As provided by law, the 150-word arguments are written by proponents and op=
ponents of each question, and reflect their opinions. The Commonwealth of M=
assachusetts does not endorse these arguments, and does not certify the tru=
th or accuracy of any statement made in these arguments. The names of the i=
ndividuals and organizations who wrote each argument, and any written comme=
nts by others about each argument, are on file in the Office of the Secreta=
ry of the Commonwealth.

IN FAVOR: A YES vote will ease the suffering of thousands of people with ca=
ncer, Parkinson=92s disease, Crohn=92s disease, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AID=
S, glaucoma, and other debilitating conditions. Scientific research has pro=
ven that marijuana can be useful for many clinical applications, including =
pain relief, nausea, and seizures.

Provisions of the proposed law requiring strict regulation by the Massachus=
etts Department of Public Health, written physician approval, a limited num=
ber of non-profit treatment centers, and criminal penalties for fraud will =
help ensure only appropriate medical use of marijuana.
This proposal has been endorsed by many patients, their families, medical p=
rofessionals, and law enforcement officials who believe that a smart, scien=
ce-based approach can help suffering patients without encouraging inappropr=
iate drug use. In fact, allowing the medical use of marijuana will lessen t=
he need for dangerous narcotics like morphine and OxyContin.

On behalf of thousands of patients, we ask for your support.

AGAINST: We all have compassion for those in pain, but the loopholes for co=
rruption and exploitation are enormous. If enacted, this law would allow:

virtually anyone could grow pot in their backyard and carry a 60-day supply;
anyone age 21 and over to operate a pot shop in your neighborhood to sell m=
arijuana for any =93medical=94 reason - not just for the seriously ill.
In Colorado, for example, less than 3% of patients suffer from cancer and H=
IV.

We do not need 35 pot shops to serve the less than 1% truly in need of medi=
cal marijuana in Massachusetts. There is already a marijuana pill available=
 for prescription (Marinol). Other marijuana medication will be available i=
n pharmacies soon.

Medical marijuana needs tighter restriction and physician oversight.

Let=92s develop medications properly and find a better path for seriously i=
ll patients, who should not be arrested. =

Protect Massachusetts from widespread abuse. Vote no.
