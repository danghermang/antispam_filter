Subject:Re: [child_lit] New York TImes review of A Casual Vacancy
"Moral exposition masked as dialog?  Heavily signposted plots?"

Isn't that almost every bestselling novel? It's certainly most of the
mysteries and few romances I've ever read. And the expression of emotion
via physical reaction is 1) not really metaphor but concretization and 2)
something you see everywhere. I mean, Raskolnikov's fever/illness is an
expression of emotion via physical reaction, and no one would suggest Crime
& Punishment is but a lowly children's book.

Honestly, I can't STAND how virtually everyone in mainstream media who
writes anything about children's/YA is not actually a person with any
substantial expertise in children's/YA. It's not like there aren't plenty
of us out there (i.e., all 1500+ members of this list, for starters - I
have no idea what the actual list membership is anymore! 1500 is just a
guess).

I might read Rowling's book, I might not; I'm not going to hunt it out.
I've got a backlog of new/new-to-me great children's/YA books to attend to
first (oh, and the dissertation. can't forget about that).

Hope everyone on the east coast is staying safe, dry, and fully-powered.
