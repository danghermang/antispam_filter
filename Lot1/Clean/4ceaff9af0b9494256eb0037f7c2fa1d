   Hello braun as Welcome to this Tech Resources update from The Register

   A Unified Approach to Web Security
   http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/978/5613a/4e3/9629572b?td=3Dm_wpe=
_h

      Organizations must extend the boundaries of their network to provide
      consistent web security protection, policies and reporting for all
      users on any device or network. By taking a unified approach that
      incorporates dynamic cloud services into traditional appliance-based
      web security deployments, savvy security professionals can adopt a
      security approach that protects "always on" users.

Consideration for the Cloud
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/985/5613a/4e3/1970b71f?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Cloud computing is one of the hottest topics in enterprise IT today.
   However, amidst all the hype and misinformation, it is critical that
   enterprise decision makers consider the Cloud as a viable strategic
   resource for their IT environment.

   This whitepaper discusses the IT challenges enterprises face and how
   the Cloud can help overcome those challenges. It then defines different
   Cloud configurations and provides guidance on enterprise
   decision-making regarding Cloud applications and platforms.

Backup and Recovery of Large-scale VMware Environments
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/99e/5613a/4e3/6ca61250?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Organizations begin with IT-based applications residing in the data
   center and, after discovering the benefits and becoming more
   comfortable with the technology, they begin to expand virtualization
   deployments. As they start virtualizing user-facing applications, new
   challenges arise.

   For those applications, consolidation is not the focus; high
   availability and data protection are. As a result, any task that limits
   productivity or scalability, such as I/O-intensive backup, must be
   examined carefully.

   Traditional backup processes aren't always the best solution in virtual
   deployments. They weren't built for the extreme data redundancy and
   hefty server loads of consolidated environments.

Achieving Compliance in Digital Investigations
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9ce/5613a/4e3/55159fd9?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   As regulation and litigation increase, internal investigators must
   support an alphabet soup of compliance obligations: SOX, GLBA, FISMA,
   HIPAA, PCI DSS, regional privacy laws, and more. Although each
   regulation is different, reflecting specific risks and markets, these
   laws share common investigation requirements in three areas: policy,
   control infrastructure, and incident response.

   Rather than prepare for and resource each compliance mandate
   separately, this paper demonstrates how in-house investigators can take
   advantage of computer forensics technology that supports these three
   key functions within a single base platform. We show how a common
   investigative infrastructure can enable appropriate investigative
   processes for disparate industry regulations and frameworks, and how it
   takes away the guesswork and reduces the risk. Plus, with this unified
   environment, enterprise teams - including HR, IT, and audit - can be as
   efficient as possible in responding to events and preparing audit- and
   court-ready materials.

   In this effort to comply more successfully and efficiently, remote
   forensics can be a force multiplier. Your limited investigation
   resources can go farther, faster. Trusted by investigators around the
   world, EnCase Enterprise provides a consistent, scalable, industry- and
   litigation-proven framework for investigating fraud, HR and information
   security incidents.

Internet Security Threat Report
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9f7/5613a/4e3/43bc0d6f?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Symantec's resources provide it's analysts with unparalleled sources of
   data with which to identify, analyze, and provide informed commentary
   on emerging trends in attacks, malicious code activity, phishing, and
   spam. The result is the annual Symantec Internet Security Threat
   Report, which gives enterprises and consumers the essential information
   to secure their systems effectively now and into the future.

Planning a Move to the Cloud
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a11/5613a/4e3/71d1660e?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Cloud Computing is a paradigm shift that sees the dawn of a new age of
   computing driven by distinct benefits. Given the undeniable value to be
   gained from a move to Cloud Computing, it is hardly surprising that
   many organizations are contemplating a shift "to the Clouds".
   Experience has shown however that organizations are concerned around
   the logistics of the move and worried about unintended consequences and
   problems.

   In this paper we describe three broad areas that organizations need to
   think about when moving to the Cloud: technical, internal and external.

   Within these three areas we highlight specific topics that
   organizations should understand prior to a move to the Cloud.
