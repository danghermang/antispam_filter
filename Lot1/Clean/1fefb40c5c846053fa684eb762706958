Date: Monday, November 5, 2012

Location: On our property at Critchley Road, Rockleigh

Rainbow Bee-eater (Merops ornatus) (2) 

Spotted Pardalote (Pardalotus punctatus) (1) 

It was our first weekend back at Rockleigh after 3 months overseas, and nice to see the bee-eaters are back. As we have only ever seen 2, could it be the same pair returning each year?

The spotted pardalote was species 67, identified from its low-flying silhouette and its call, after comparing the call with that on our smart phone app.

The swallows that roosted under our veranda for almost 4 years have gone, and obviously have not been around for quite a while judging by the lack of fresh droppings.
