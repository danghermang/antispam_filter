This shows a resonance at 14.7 MHz with an input resistance of 20
ohms.  Obviously it shows a common-mode current at the top of the
feeder but it was a surprise how quickly the common-mode effect died
away down the feeder.  At 0.1 wavelength from the feed point the
current imbalance was about -30 dB.
