Thomas, there are only two reasons for a cap to 'fry':

1) Over voltage -this includes spikes.

2) Polarity in the case of electrolytic caps. Using a polarized cap in a ci=
rcuit that has a major component of AC or connecting it incorrectly.

These are simple electro-mechanical circuits so using a meter to check for =
voltage and polarity at the cap should solve it. The only potential complic=
ation is the presence of spikes due to the kickback from coils in the circu=
it.=A0 In cases where a cap is connected across a coil I generally use on a=
 lot higher than the average voltage.=A0 If the circuit is 25VDc I'll try t=
o use a cap of 50-100 volts rating.

There is an upper limit in that caps too much higher in voltage rating migh=
t not have enough charge to "form" properly and behave as if they have less=
 capacity.

----------------------------------------------------------

Frankly, many of the caps made in the last 14 years are crap. If you work o=
n as much electronic equipment as I do you've easily seen dozens of devices=
 hobbled and ruined by capacitors.

I've repaired over 60 flat panel computer monitors, all of which had bad ca=
ps as the underlying cause of failure.=A0 There are another 17 awaiting par=
ts and attention. They join the 14 flat panel TV's and a dozen or so DVD pl=
ayers and 6-7 computer logic boards all with the same capacitor failures. T=
here were a lot more logic boards but I finally advised throwing out all bu=
t the most recent and powerful ones.

Meanwhile, In my local travels, I still find receivers and other items made=
 in the 60's through mid-nineties that still perform properly and have good=
 capacitors.

Clearly something has changed. Initially, the problem was chalked up to a c=
ase of corporate espionage in Taiwan vs. mainland China.=A0 But that was ba=
ck in the late 90's.

Now it looks more like a cynical businessman's scheme to force consumers to=
 replace their electronics more often.

=A0Do you still have the original cap?

We installed a new cap in the junction box for the selector motor and the u=
nit started to cycle, -but stopped and fried the newly installed cap. Tried=
 another cap and same results. Not sure where to go next. Looked for any ob=
vious signs that would indicate what caused this but no luck. Any suggestio=
ns and help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Tom
