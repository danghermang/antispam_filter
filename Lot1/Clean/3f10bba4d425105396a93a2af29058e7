Thanks for this link, however in this case this is not a complete
answer.

I was obviously unclear, so let me try again.

1. This link was not posted *in advance*. The reason I proposed in
   advance is partially so that we could get review and feedback such as
   Wilfried's, and prevent future issues.

2. It was not sent to any of the RIPE mailing lists until after
   problems were reported. RIPE Labs is cool, but AFAIK the RIPE
   community still lives & breathes in the RIPE working group mailing
   lists.

3. There is apparently neither a procedure nor a policy concerning
   notification of experiments.

Cheers,
