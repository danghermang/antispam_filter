Subject:[burners] B.E.D
This is a repost from the Firefly page on Facebook supplied here for those
of you who are not FB connected.  For the record,  the response was sizable.



I've been thinking of setting up something like the Bureau of Erotic
Discourse (B.E.D. at Burningman) workshop at Firefly. There was a stalking
incident two Fireflies ago and I wondered if FF had grown to the point that
we should prepare ourselves for events that the greater Burningman
community has been force to address. I am not a well organized person and I
hoped others would precede me, but there were events at this year's burn
that compel me to give it a try.
