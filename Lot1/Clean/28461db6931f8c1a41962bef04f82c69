Subject:Re: [Hsqldb-user] Re g: Not able to load a csv file into hsqldb
 using sqltool which is having the quotes(") in some columns

Thanks Fred.
But I don't want to use TEXT TABLE as it will link it to a csv file and in
turn query on it which makes my job slow.
I specidified (|) as the separator but still it was not loading the data. I
think its not ignoring the quote and its waiting for a closing quote. Is
there any setting like 
*QUOTED=FALSE; 
so as to tell sqltool to think quote as an text qualifier.

thanks in advance,
-sandeep.
