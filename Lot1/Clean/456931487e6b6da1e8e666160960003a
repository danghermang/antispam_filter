Subject:[Antenna-discussion]  Ordinary run of the mill dipole
Alan G3NOQ wrote about antennas with large-diameter conductors needing to be 
physically shorter to achieve self-resonance than when using small OD 
conductors:

As was/is shown in my earlier post with the link below.

Note that the 77m, center-fed, 1/2WL dipole there is self-resonant close to 
1825 kHz.

This amounts to a ~6% reduction of the physical length of that antenna from 
a free-space half wavelength at that frequency.
