Subject:[CT Birds] White pelican
White Pelican at Rocky Neck at noon today.  Also, Northern Gannets easily seen from niantic boardwalk area.  I parked at the gas station across from the Black Sheep bar on main st. and there were about 10 off in the distance and 2 right in the bay within a few hundred feet.
