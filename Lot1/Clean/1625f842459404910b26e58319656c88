Subject:Re: [PATCH]: ch03: A note to MS office users regarding keyword
 substitutions
Mike,

My hope was to have an explicit message to the users who manage office docu=
ments with svn. They often are not aware of =

the binary nature of their documents and are suprised about the results of =
the keyword substitution or not aware about =

the dangers. I fear that these users wont probably not recognize that the w=
arning of this added paragraph applies to them.

regards

Walter
