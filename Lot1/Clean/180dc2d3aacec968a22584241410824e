Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Perhaps the likely candidate to build a ferrite antenna would be Alan =

Payne, test it and write-up the results....

What think the list?

BTW: Our regular contributor, Joel Hungerford, KB1EGI experimented =

with all sorts of materials, including Magnetite for small antennas.
