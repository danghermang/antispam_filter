Subject:[CT Birds] Siskins, Purple Finches & O/T Question about Acorn Mast
A flock of 30+ Siskins just arrived at my north Stamford home.  Have had 2 pairs of Purple Finches here for over 2 weeks.

Has anyone noticed an extremely low-to-non-existent acorn mask this year?  On top of last years' non-existent mast, it makes me worry about squirrel, chipmunk and deer survival this winter...
