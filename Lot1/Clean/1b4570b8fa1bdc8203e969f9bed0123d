Subject:[child_lit] Slightly OT: Luxembourg advice?
Hello everyone,

My family and I will be living in Luxembourg in the spring (at least Feb. 1
through the end of June...hopefully through the end of July) while I do
some research on *Tintin* (so there's your ChildLit connection) in nearby
Brussels.

However, we're having a very difficult time finding housing.  If anyone
here has any advice on apartments, houses, or shared houses we could rent
in Lux during the spring and/or summer of 2013, please write me directly at
dr.joess@gmail.com .

Thanks in advance,
Joe
