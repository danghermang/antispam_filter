I abandoned contracts years ago and always now buy phones unlocked, 
sim-free.

GiggGaff is the way to go. Cheapest PAYG (and really PAYG not use it or 
lose it!)

I'm spending half what I was a month on my calls, txts and 3g now than I 
was when I was with O2 (same network, half the cost!)

Their "Goody bags" can be a bit confusing at first, but you don't need 
them at all, but if you do use them, then they last one month then expire 
- leaving any existing top-up credit there for you to carry on with.

I appreciate that for some, getting a phone on a contract is the only way 
though, but do shop around - look for good, but end of line phones, etc. 
and do not be afraid to jump networks - most networks will deliberately 
create a hassle to ge a PAC, but once you have it, you then have 30 days 
to use it (with no obligation either - they'll not cut you off if you 
don't use it) Most network allow you to import a number after you've 
signed up with them - you start a new deal, get a new number then you can 
port in your existing number. I've recently done that with GiffGaff - 
absolutely no hassle to port in, lots of hassle to get the PAC out of O2 
though, but I got one in the end - the trick is to use the online chat 
thingy.

Do check your local network coverage - Vodafone didn't have good 3G 
coverage in south devon last time I looked but O2 is improving all the 
time and Three is probably the best for data.
