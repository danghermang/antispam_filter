Subject:Re: [child_lit] Critical term
Thanks, June, but I cheat. Loads of the terms are actually from rhetoric. L=
iterary and rhetorical studies weren't vastly different until the Royal Soc=
iety moved to purge figuration from prose in the 1660s, leading us to think=
 that prose is somehow a transparent window between us and the truth.  (Whi=
ch it isn't.)

A fun website, btw, is Silva Rhetorica (Latin, "The Forest of Rhetoric"), h=
ttp://rhetoric.byu.edu/.

I learn more good stuff on this list. And I have to say that Jameela knows =
more literary terms than anyone I've ever encountered.

I'd say it is a form of Personification (as is the Pathetic fallacy, also).
