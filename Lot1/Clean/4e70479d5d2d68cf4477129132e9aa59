The Introduction (that you have now already found
and read) gives the briefest, broadest overview.
http://www.wiser.org/article/a1ad51d14fa5214ca243a64490e590b6

The "Isonomea Proposals" wikipage contains an outline that
states each particular existing proposal in six words or less, on one line.
http://www.wiser.org/article/8eb6b81a94491ee91d2b004aa2727966

At the bottom of each proposal wikipage, there is a "Next" link.
Following that link on each page will take you through
all of the proposals, in the order that they appear
on the "Isonomea Proposals" page. The first proposal:

The objective of the "game" is to create,
test, demonstrate, popularize, legitimize, start up,
and grow a new kind of social system, from scratch.

The game starts with no existing social system,
as if we were colonizing a new planet.

First we make the new social system fully operational
in an online virtual world (the new planet),
and then we use the choices, systems, and arrangements
of the virtual world as the "blueprint" for creating
the same social system in the real world.

The three primary kinds of "moves" in the game are:
- forming partnerships,
- submitting proposals,
- undertaking projects.

The wiki already contains over 150 proposal "moves" in this game.
