Subject:Re: [child_lit] younger reader/MG titles with girl protagonists?

Dear Kerry - Yes, a topic near and dear to my heart too. 

I have a realistic fiction loving 8 yo girl - quite different from her fantasy loving 10yo brother -- so I've had to familiarize myself with these titles over the years. You also might want to check out From the Mixed Up Files of Middle Grade Authors (www.fromthemixedupfiles.com) a great blog for thoughts like this...

Early Chapter/MG Books 
1. The Magic Treehouse series by Mary Pope Osbourne, since it stars a brother and sister, is very appealing
2. The Ivy and Bean series by Annie Barrows, about two good girl friends having adventures
3. The Clementine books by Sara Pennypacker are just delicious
4. The Judy Moody books by Megan McDonald also very sweet/silly adventures
5. I'm listing, but with reservations, the Junie B. Jones books, which my kids seemed to enjoy for a while
6. The Amber Brown books - not new but Paula Danziger treats


More solidly MG books
7. OK - also not recent, but RAMONA QUIMBY! Who can forget the fabulous girl heroine by Beverly Clearly? (and when she finished the Ramona books, she wasn't opposed to reading about Henry Huggins either)
8. THE PENDERWICKS - This family's current favorite series by Jeanne Birdsall, wonderful books reminiscent of Little Women, Little House on the Prairie, but very modern 
9. Emily Windsnap series by Liz Kessler - a girl discovers she's a mermaid
10. The Sisters 8 series - short adventures about octoplets by Lauren Baratz-Logstead, my kids thought these were hilarious
11. The Water Balloon - by Audrey Vernick, beautiful!
12. Millicent Min, Girl Genius - another favorite of ours by Lisa Yee (honestly, anything by Lisa Yee -- her Bobby vs. Girls series also has a great girl best friend)
13. I'm surprising myself here - but some of the American Girl series - my daughter has recently discovered several titles she adores, three by Lisa Yee - Aloha Kanani, and Good Job Kanani, as well as Good Luck Ivy were very popular with her.
14 Grace Lin's Year of the Dog, Year of the Rat, Newberry winning When the Mountain Meets the Moon
15. Uma Krishnaswamy's The Grand Plan to Change Everything was also a big hit with my kids
16. Sheela Chari's Vanished - a girl who's lost her Veena, lovely mystery - was just an Al Roker pick recently

There are many fantasy series in this age group with brother/sister pairings
17. The Akhenaten Adventure/Children of the Lamp  series by P.B. Kerr- a brother and sister who discover they are djinn
18. Rick Riordan's Kane Chronicles

I hope that's helpful! It was helpful to me just thinking about them!
