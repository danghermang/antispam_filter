Yes, there is. :)
I haven't done this before, but there is a wiki page:
http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Moving_an_installation_from_a_regular_install_to_the_Debian_packages

What I did was:

1) backup my DB (for example -- make sure to change the dbuser and dbname 
parts):
$ mysqldump -u <dbuser> -p <dbname> > mybackup.sql

2) a fresh install of the OS and the packages install up to and including 
the koha-create.

3) put my old db in place (for example -- make sure to change the 
instancename part):
$ sudo koha-mysql <instancename> < mybackup.sql

4) Then I continued the packages installation. The web install step did the 
database scheme upgrades.

Granted, this is much easier when going from 3.4 or higher to current stable 
(3.8.x). Prior to 3.4.x, there would be a couple more commands to do.

GPML,
