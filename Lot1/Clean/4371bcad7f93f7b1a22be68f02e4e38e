Like Sharon, I am much happier knowing that you guys are safe and hope that you all remain so. I have a delete key, too. I can't begin to image what it must be like at the moment so just sending my sympathies to you all in the path of Sandy. Having seen what a much smaller belting did to Darwin, I know it must be scary.

Keep safe all of you,

Cheers,
Jacquei

Dude, I'm not that worried, I can hit the delete key.  I just wanted to know if it was just me.

Thoughts are with you.

Hugs,

Sharon

Quite a bit of central New Jersey is under-water and power is out throughout a fair part of the state. I know that some of you are receiving annoying and improper emails, for which I am dreadfully sorry, but as unwelcome as this is, it does not rise to the level of magnitude that will concern University personnel right at the moment. If someone would be kind enough to forward one of the emails to me, I will see what I can do to put a stop to them.
