Subject:Re: [Koha] Purchase request vanishes into thin air?
Hi, Elaine--

To see of all our pending purchase suggestions, after clicking
"Suggestions pending approval," there is a pull-down menu on the left
("Organize by")--it's set to "Status" but we need to change it to
"Library," then click "Go," and then we'll see anonymous purchase
suggestions that we didn't see before.  Maybe worth a try?  (We're
running 3.8, also allow anonymous suggestions, and have a
one-library/no branches catalog.)

Cheers,
heather
