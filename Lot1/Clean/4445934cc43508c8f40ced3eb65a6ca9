Subject:Re: [EVDL] Power Consumption Question
Watt-hours is a better measure because it takes voltage into account and is
easier to compare numbers from different packs/vehicles.

Amp-hours may be easier to keep track of range within a specific
pack/vehicle because the amp-hours available will vary less than the
watt-hours available; you should be able to more consistently estimate
available and remaining range using amp-hours than watt-hours (assuming you
have previous data from that pack to compare to).
