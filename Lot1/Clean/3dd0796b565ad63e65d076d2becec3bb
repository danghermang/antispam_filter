Oh, how could I forget:

Sean McMullen

Voices in the Light (Aphelion, 1994) (novel)
Mirrorsun Rising (Aphelion, 1995) (novel)

Australian, 2000 years into the future, after world wide ice age called
Greatwinter.

A nanotech factory on the moon was built to create a solar shield for
Earth, but civilization collapsed before any more could be created. For
2000 years it labored to create the shield, then activated it over the
now mediaeval Earth.

In the future mediaeval society, electricity is outlawed because the
machines in orbit will destroy any form of power they can detect.

All transportation is via wind or pedal trains, and communication is an
elaborate signalling system.

A librarian (they are politically powerful in this future world) builds
a computer out of 2000 human slaves and abacus, and uses it to increase
her power and prepare for another ice age.

Sea creatures have developed a lure known as The Call, which compels
humans to drown themselves in the ocean.

I thoroughly enjoyed this.
