Subject:Re: [CT Birds] (no subject)
These Evening Grsobeak reports are encouraging. NAS reports that there has been a 91% decline since 1967. CBC s in CT in the 1980s the numbers were in the thousands and dropped off into single digits in the late 90s and 2000s. Ihope this trend continues. Has there been a spruce bud worm out break in the boreal forests of Canada?
