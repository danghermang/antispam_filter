__For those of you who don't get the RBR newsletter here is an amazing story.__________________________________

Editor?s Note: Sometimes you live, or hear or read about a great cycling story and just know you have to share it. Barry Clout is a 49-year-old roadie from North Bay, Ontario, Canada, who reads RBR ?faithfully every week,? he says, and both commutes by bike and enjoys his weekend rides. Barry recently shared with me one such remarkable cycling story ? in hopes that I would be able to share it with all of RBR?s readers. I wholeheartedly agreed with him that it?s a story worth sharing. So here it is, in Barry?s words:
?Can You Turn off the Wind??

This past July, my 17-year-old daughter, Meghan, and I drove from Ontario to Newfoundland. As the normal route has become somewhat standard for us, we decided to take the ?scenic route,? which is to say we adventured across the newly completed Trans-Labrador Highway.

I advise readers ? Canadian and otherwise ? to take a quick look at a map, as this is unfamiliar territory for most. The Trans-Labrador Highway is about 1,200 km (about 750 miles) of gravel road around the 55th parallel. This sub-arctic region in Northeastern Canada is very sparse and remote. They call it ?The Big Land.?

There is only one highway and four small towns across the east-west route, which are spaced about 350 to 500 km (217 to 310 miles) apart. Between these towns, there is nothing but clumps of trees, beautiful, untouched rivers and lakes, caribou, moose and black bear. It is quiet ? very, very quiet.

About 2 hours into our 4th and final leg of the Trans-Labrador ? the 550 km, 10-hour leg from Happy Valley to Red Bay, I spotted a strange shape ahead on the road. I alerted Meg and, as we got closer, both of us were trying to figure out what it was. Moose? Caribou? Neither. We finally realized it was an elderly gentleman pushing a bicycle!

Now, you have to consider where we were at this point. On one of the most remote roads in North America. A gravel road. Hundreds of kilometers from any type of service in either direction.

As we approached and stopped, thinking his bike was broken down, I asked, ?Are you OK? Do you need anything?? His reply, ?Can you turn off the wind??

This was my introduction to Heinz Stucke.

Some of you may have heard of Heinz. But in my 5 years as an avid cyclist, I had not. When it comes to embracing a lifestyle of cycling, Heinz is a rock star. At the age of 72, he has been riding the world on a fold-up bicycle for over 50 years. Guinness calls him ?The Most Traveled Man by Bicycle in History.? That was in 1995. He has not slowed down since then.

Back on the Trans-Labrador, Meg and I had been thinking, as we were driving along in our Volvo SUV, that we were the most adventurous people we knew. Then we meet this Heinz ? who is not young ? on a fold-up bicycle in the absolute middle of nowhere! It was a moment of disbelief and awe.

We got out of the car and engaged Heinz in conversation for about half an hour. As we talked, part of his story emerged. How he had traveled in Africa, North and South America, Asia. He?s been through Patagonia, Alaska, Siberia (Siberia!).

He told us about getting robbed, traveling with others, taking pictures and selling them as postcards. About his ?sponsor? who sends him small sums of money. About how the bugs and the wind were driving him crazy in Labrador, as well as the dust thrown up by the trucks as they passed by at great speeds. He mentioned his encounter with a bear the previous night.

At that point, Heinz was 6 days out from the last town he saw, and he had at least 2 or 3 more days to go to reach the next town. We had a car full of food, water, camp fuel, clothes, bedding, etc. We offered him whatever we had. He took only a couple of oranges and a few granola bars.

Feeling that it just wasn?t enough, I reached into my pocket and gave him $50. Tears welled in Heinz?s eyes. That?s when I got a strong sense that he was a very sincere and genuine person who had followed the only path in his life that made sense to him. That path has taken him over 600,000 km (373,000 miles) on a fold-up bike with a few old packs to carry his worldly belongings.

I have found out more about Heinz since returning home and searching on the Internet. He has quite an online presence with an official website, a wiki page, even a Facebook page. Bike Friday and Brompton ? manufacturers of the fold-up bicycles he has used ? have him featured on their websites. A Google search yields intriguing pictures of his bikes, how he sets them up, and some of the amazing places he has cycled.

I?ve learned that Heinz is on a mission to become the first person in history to visit every country on earth. He?s got a great head-start, but still a ways to go. (He accepts donations on his official website.)

As we parted, Heinz assured me that he would toast Meghan and me when he got to the next town and had a drink on us. I hope it was a strong drink, because he?d been eating a lot of dust on the Trans-Labrador Highway
