Subject:New Sqitch Failures
Hi ActiveStaters,

I put out a big new release of Sqitch this week, so naturally I'm seeing new test PPM failures. Would you mind looking into some of these?

  Something wrong with the Moose build?

  Something wrong with B::Hooks::EndOfScope?

  Moose too old.

  Uses CPAN install of Math::BigInt (still not fixed: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=80182)

Thanks!
