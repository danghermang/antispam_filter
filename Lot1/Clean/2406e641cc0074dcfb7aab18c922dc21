Subject:Re: [address-policy-wg] [Ticket#2012110601002595] Status of /24 PI
	IPv4 from last /8
Hi,

> this statement might need some adjustment to "there is no IPv4 PI, can =
we do something else?", like "can we use IPv6 PI plus double-IPv4-PA?" =
or "can we use IPv6 PI plus our ISP's friendly NAT64 translator?"...

I think these are the only options that can survive in the medium to =
long term. At some point in time the final /8 will also be depleted and =
then everybody will be unhappy. We should start moving in such a =
direction *now*.

Geoff Huston showed us years ago: we were meant to deploy IPv6 before =
the IPv4 pool ran out. We postponed deployment until we did run out. If =
we keep postponing solutions that don't rely on IPv4 address space then =
we will remain in the situation we are in now and the pain will become =
worse and worse.

We have been making policies for specific cases (we now have PA form the =
final /8, we have IXP space from that /8, we are discussing PI from that =
/8 now). Maybe we need to take a step back and look at the big picture =
first. I personally think that it would be very bad if ISPs don't have =
any IPv4 space for things like central NAT64 boxes or similar services =
for example. We have the current final /8 policy for that now, but lets =
look a few steps ahead...
