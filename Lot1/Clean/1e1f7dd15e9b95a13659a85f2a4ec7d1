Subject:Re: [Hsqldb-user] Why using coalesce on a foreign key,
 results in a non executable statement ?

Hi Fred,

Sorry for the posting on the wrong forum, I saw your previous post on this
and looked for the help forum and thought this HSQLDB USER was the one.

I now understand it is not.

May I ask you where this help forum is ?

Also, when you say: "development questions", do you mean questions about
development of HSQLDB, that is, the rdbms itself ? 

Kind Regards,

--
