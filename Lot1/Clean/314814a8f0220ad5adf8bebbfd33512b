Subject:[Koha] Call for news for the November newsletter
Dear Koha kommunitarians,

I'm harvesting news for this month's newsletter. Please send me by the 20th
anything you think your fellow community members might like to know about.

"News" can be as short as a sentence or as long as a paper. I especially
encourage you to send me a line or two for the gossip/society column about
what you're currently working on.

And if you know of a go-live not announced on the list, please be sure to
let me know about it.

Thanks,
Daniel Grobani
