Redwoods by Jason Chin:

Grade 1=964=97This remarkable picture book delivers a mix of fantasy and fi=
ction through beautifully detailed watercolors. Waiting on a subway platfor=
m alone, a boy finds a book about redwood trees and becomes captivated whil=
e reading it on the train. As he learns that there are trees alive today th=
at first sprouted during the Roman Empire, readers notice two passengers se=
ated beside him from that period. When he comes out of the station, he find=
s himself deep in a redwood forest, where, clad in climber's gear and a har=
ness, he launches a rope, climbs a tree, discovers wildlife in the branches=
, and experiences the many wonders similar to a professional researcher. Co=
lorful panels focus on his observations. Chin superbly captures the boy's v=
aried expressions throughout his adventure. Perspective is artfully used to=
 show the immensity of the trees as he rappels back down into the city with=
 images of landmarks and skyscrapers. Reality returns when he notices the t=
ime and darts off, leaving the book behind for a girl to discover and begin=
 her journey in the redwoods. The final pages include information about the=
 environmental dangers that the redwoods face, some nature graphics drawn t=
o scale, and an inspiring author's note. This inventive story will charm an=
d educate readers and send their imaginations soaring.=97Anne Beier, Hendri=

Hi, all

A K-1 classroom teacher has asked for recommendations for their first read-=
aloud CHAPTER book to read to her kids that relate to their curriculum focu=
s of "trees". So short-attention span chapters, thematically related to: tr=
ees, redwoods, forests, creatures who live in trees/forests, etc. Ideas? I =
started with THE MINPINS by Dahl and then got stuck in no-idea-land :-)
