What make and model of jukebox do you have?  Many have the capability to
accommodate both hole sizes, usually with a speed shifter that you might
have to disable.

A 1.5 inch hole saw might work but you would want a pilot that fits
relatively snugly in the existing spindle hole and I wouldn't risk it on
a rare or valuable record.
