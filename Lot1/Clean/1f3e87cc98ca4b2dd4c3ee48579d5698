Subject:[burners] Shipping art
Hey Boston Burners!

We're putting together a Coachella art grant proposal for Rock Inferno
(the flame-throwing Guitar Hero game we brought to Burning Man in 2010
and 2011). As part of it, we're trying to get an idea of what it would
cost to ship the rig out to California from MA or CT.

We've never actually shipped Rock Inferno except to Burning Man on the
Boston Container. We don't know where to start! Does anyone here have
any advice on shipping art cross-country? The rig breaks down into a lot
of pieces and is probably a good candidate to be palletized. It's a
little over 100 cubic feet, altogether.

At the moment we're just trying to get an idea of cost so that we can
apply for the grant, but it doesn't hurt to be thorough, so any advice
on shipping would be most appreciated.

Thanks,
--Dennis & the rest of Arsonic Creations
