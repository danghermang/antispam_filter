Subject:Re: [burners] Question 1: Availability of Motor Vehicle Repair
	Information
If I am not mistaken, the laws on the books are such that OEMs rent
the proprietary tools. I worked for a company that made VW manuals so I
found out a lot about the inner workings of this law. I recall hearing that
independent shops could rent the OEM VW tool to use to service cars but it
was so prohibitively expensive (with a $30k deposit for what is essentially
a tablet PC with a custom OS) that they couldn't afford it. Therefore VW
was complying with the law while still making it nearly impossible to for
an independent shop let alone an individual to repair their own cars.
The proposed legislation is to further get around would end around this
issue.
