Subject:[LUG] Holsworthy meeting 17th November
Our next meeting is due next Saturday. I have just realised that is also
Holsworthy  carnival day. The actual procession is in the evening but
there is an event which takes place in the lower car park in the
afternoon, for the children.

This includes a procession up through the town, so for a short time the
roads are closed. I will double check on the times and pass the info on.

Thanks

Neil
