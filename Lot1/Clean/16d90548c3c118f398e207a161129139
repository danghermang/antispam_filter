Subject:Re: [Flexradio] mike
This is one of the most discussed area in just about any forum that is
around a brand of transmitter.  :)

The simple answer is any microphone that is designed for voice
communications.  A mike that takes care of the audio shaping up to about
3khz (about the point normal voice tails off).

Certainly, Bob Heil has this figured out and if you  haven't, it is worth
review Bob's studies on the Bell Labs and the shaping of voice
communications.  There are other vendors of voice communications
microphones, but I would want to see what their curves look like.
