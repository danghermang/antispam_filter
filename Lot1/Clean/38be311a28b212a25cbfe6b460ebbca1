Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] What is the difference between Wurlitzer 1500,
	1500A, 1550 and 1550A?
I don't think so Jeff. The basic differences were cabinet styles between
the '52 and '53 models. Those machines were NOT hi-fidelity. They all had a
single 15" dynamic range speaker. Good sound, but not hi-fi -- just plain
old 25w tube amp analog mono. They had good sound but the 2 mil cobra
cartridge was limited because it had to play both 45 & 78rpm records
interchangeably... The machine is a mechanical nightmare to keep in
adjustment and from jamming. Must have been hell for Operators in the field
at the time to keep these running. They were a commercial failure and
mercifully replaced by the new Wurlitzer carousel mechanism a year later,
in 1954...
