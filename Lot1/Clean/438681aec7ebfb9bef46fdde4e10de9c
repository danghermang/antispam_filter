I lived through Hurricane Hazel which hit TORONTO in 1954:

http://www.hurricanehazel.ca/
On October 15, 1954, the most famous hurricane in Canadian history 
struck Southern Ontario. Hurricane Hazel was projected to dissipate, but 
instead re-intensified unexpectedly and rapidly, pounding the Toronto 
region with winds that reached 110 kilometres per hour (68 mph) and 285 
millimetres (11.23 inches) of rain in 48 hours.

OK, it wasn't 145MPH, but it sure made a mess of Toronto...Hazel had hit 
155MPH in the Caribbean mind you.

I was only three at the time, so don't recall anything but I hear it was 
windy.

(Toronto is hundreds of miles from the east coast of Canada....)
