That's an excellent introduction.  I would put that at the top of the
intro page, and anywhere else folks might ask, "What's this about?"

A possible risk: What works in a blank-slate, pretend world does not
work in a real world with a history, material interests, and so forth.
So the translation from game to reality fails, or isn't quite as
straightforward as we hope.  (Not that this would necessarily be a
show stopper, as you might find a solution along the way.)

In any case, please don't forget to share your progress (stuff you
learn, and what not) in real-world forums such as this one.  :-)
