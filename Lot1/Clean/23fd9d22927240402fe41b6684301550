I don't have administrative access to the list, so unfortunately I can't
help you directly, but if you look at the email you responded to, you'll
find that it says you can follow this link:
http://chaoshacker.org/mailman/listinfo/burners to unsubscribe. If you look
at the bottom of that page, there is a box where you can enter your email
address to unsubscribe.

Hope that helps,
Josh
