That's right.  Even if the package builders are still running for that build. The App-Squitch build seems to have failed with:

  ... requires perl 'v5.10.1'; you have only 5.010000; giving up

We don't plan to upgrade the perl-5.10 builder to 5.10.1.

This build machine still had Hash::Merge v0.11 installed in the "megalib".  I manually forced an install of Hash::Merge v0.12 (it was already built) and then restarted the App-Sqitch build again.  It went through this time.  The new build should get published soonish.
