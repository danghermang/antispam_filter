Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] G-200 Credit Issue
Not sure what you mean buy accumulator or standard. I am referring to the cr=
edit unit and keypad combo located at the top/right/ front of the box. The w=
iper arm is the one in the credit unit. Yes about the pin, once the wiper ar=
m in the credit unit starts to rotate (after a bump from me) then it makes t=
he correct pulses from the converter and all other operations work fine.
