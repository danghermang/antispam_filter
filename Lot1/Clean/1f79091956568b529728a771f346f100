---and to further confuze things--other relay manufactures made both AC, an=
d DC=A0 relays with white, and red covers---also clear, blue, yellow, orang=
e, and amber ---=20
Also, they have been made/marked as 6, 8, 12, 24, 28, 30, 48, 50, 110, 117,=
 and 120 volt coils, that I have seen--Ron Rich=20

The difference between the red and white relays is that the red ones have 2=

volt AC coils and the white/clear ones have 24 volt DC coils.=A0 If you che=

Newtjr:

I did encounter a bit of confusion with the relays in the junction box in=
=20
relation to the junction schematics in both the W2900 and W3300 manuals.

According to the schematic RY2 should be a dc/white relay. However, on the=
=20
junction itself this is a red ac relay.
I was advised that the red and white relays can sometimes be interchanged.

The relay sockets are painted ry2 and 6 are red. They work fine this way. T=
hey=20
should also be labelled on the junction. Else you can use the junction sche=
matic=20
to trace which of the round sockets go to which relays.
