Subject:[ncc-services-wg] New on RIPE Labs: LIR and IPv6 Statistics
Dear colleagues,

Please find a new article on RIPE Labs:

https://labs.ripe.net/Members/wilhelm/ripe-ncc-membership-statistics-november-2012

At the end of Q3 2012, we looked at the number of new LIRs and the 
resources allocated over the last few months. We were particularly 
interested to see if there are any significant changes since the RIPE 
NCC started allocating from the last /8.

Kind regards,
Mirjam Kuehne
RIPE NCC
