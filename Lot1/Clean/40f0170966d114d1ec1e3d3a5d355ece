Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] Lisa Webber's is a meteorite
Hi Mike, Mike, and List,

It is somewhat comical, but even the best of us can be fooled from
time to time.  There are some very convincing meteorwrongs in
circulation, and we've had some recent high-profile falls that have
increased the likelihood of fakes/scams, so an extra measure of
caution is probably warranted.

I was wondering why some scientists who go out into the field don't
take some gadgets with them - like a magnetic susceptibility meter and
an XRF gun.  That would make preliminary identification of samples
more sure.

Best regards,

MikeG
