Subject:[meteorite-list] AAArrrggghhhh,
	where has the alternative version of the list archive gone??
Hi all,

I use the alternative version of the list archive to read all the list
posts. I used to keep the webpage permanently open and refresh it to
see the latest posts. However, now this version appears to have
dissapeared. Anyone any idea if its still accessible?

Any help, much, much appreciated :-)

Cheers

Martin
