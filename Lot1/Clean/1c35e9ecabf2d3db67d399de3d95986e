Subject:[LUG] OT: SCSI drives
Hi folks,

This is a bit off topic, but a friend of mine runs a college radio  
station on some really old (16 years or so old) kit.  He has a machine  
that the hard drive has started to fail on.

The machine uses Ultra Wide SCSI drives (with 68 pin connectors).  I  
wondered before we start scouring eBay if anyone might possibly have  
any old SCSI drives like this kicking around that they might want to  
get shot off either ideally free or cheaply?

Ta,

Rob
