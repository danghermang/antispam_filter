Noooo, not as a theory Roald.  As evidenced by us all, bar one.
Yes, the blame for not clearing the ball in from the freekick was Ivanovic and Cech.  He's the bit you might want to read slowly.  Defensive error, needlessly conceded, Luiz.  Ergo, he can't have had a flawless game.
Second incident.  Letting the ball drop over his head that only just reached Cech ahead of Defoe.  
So flawless, your word, he was not.
Apart from that, he had a good game.
