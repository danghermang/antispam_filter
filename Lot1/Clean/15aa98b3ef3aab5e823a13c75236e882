Subject:[Birding-Aus] Have YOU seen any Fork-tailed Swifts
G'day List Members

The last FTS sightings I have been able to get my eyes on were around  
Broome on 11th & 12th Oct.  There were a few around Darwin before that.

Then Yesterday I saw two in Bunyip S.P. just East of Melbourne.  So  
these ones have flown down here without being seen - or at least  
without being reported.

Have any of you seen any?  With the current long-run wind systems  
over the whole of Australia they could move large distances in a  
short time - if they wanted to.  In fact most sightings of FTS & WTNT  
described as travelling have been going into the wind.  I often see  
them gliding into the wind for long distances.  Some observers used  
to think that they would prefer to go with the wind, well they can go  
in any direction with only the occasional wing-beat, so long as there  
is some wind.

But to know which direction they are heading in at the moment I need  
your reports - if you have any.

Many thanks for those published thus far, or sent to me so far.

Cheers & Happy birding

Mike
