Hi, Liz--

As a former children's content editor for MultiCultural Review, long-time
reviewer and co-editor of three books of reviews, my advice is not to be
nervous. If you're a reviewer, it's your job to point out when a book is or
isn't worth reading, point out the plusses and minuses of a book, point out
factual errors, or racist writing, or anything else that makes a good
review. If you know the difference between reviewing a book ("this book is
racist at the core") and slandering an author ("this author is racist at his
core"), you're safe.

And, I think it would be just too cool to write a review of the disclaimer! =


Take care,

Beverly

careful of Mitchell Lane only, or is it best as a policy not to point out
when a book isn't worth reading?  Should I tone down the review I already
posted of the Mitchell Lane book?  The thing that shocked me about the book
was the disclaimer. I could write a review that focused only on that
disclaimer. After all, if a publisher isn't willing to stand behind the
veracity of their books, why buy them?

responsibility do we have to kids and their teachers to let them know when
something isn't worth reading?  Doesn't a disclaimer automatically make the
book not worth reading? If you can't trust that the data in the book is
true, how can it be worth reading? I do still read Wikipedia, but I know
very well that I could be reading something written by a professional with
45 years in the field about which I'm reading, or I could be reading
something written by an amateur in the field who has limited knowledge.
