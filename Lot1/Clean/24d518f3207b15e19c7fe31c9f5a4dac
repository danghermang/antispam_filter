Subject:[Chelsea] Depressing
Nothing much to say, this post is just an utter waste of time, you might as
well ask "well why they f are you bothering" and I just don't know, but all
these racist episodes surrounding our club are so depressing.

You'd think people are aware just how serious an issue this is, there
should not be even the slightest hint of racist words being uttered, yet JT
had to go and say stupid things, whatever his intentions were, in front of
all the bloody cameras. Christ. (Sorry if a Muslim shouldn't take that name
in vain.....)

Now this Clattenburg fiasco. Surely he is too intelligent to say the things
alleged, knowing there are cameras focused on him the whole time at every
angle, at a time when black players are boycotting Kick it Out and racism
is the hot topic on all the football shows and in the papers.

It makes one believe racism is an innate thing, we cannot escape it, in
times of stress and tension it will come out of even the best of us,
however well intentioned we may be when calm and rational. But, it can be
contained and suppressed, just as (hetero) men have to repress sexual urges
when seeing a gorgeous woman in a miniskirt (well I have to anyway).
 Rapists still exist, and always will, and so will racists.

Well thanks for reading this rambling post without any point, those of you
who made it this far......
