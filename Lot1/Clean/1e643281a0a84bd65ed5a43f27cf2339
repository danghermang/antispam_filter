Cheryl's comments raised a question in my mind, that may be nonsense--if,
say twenty years in the future, the events of a book like this have become
part of history (the DRC having bcome, we can hope, a peaceful democracy),
does a book about its dark period become historical fiction?  Or do does a
book have to be historical fiction from the start, and if it isn't labeled
thus, does it just become dated?
