Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] G-200 Credit Issue
Early G200's have the credit unit crammed inside the pushbutton assembly 
next to the pulse generator. Later G200's have an accumulator as found in 
the H and I models that is usually mounted on the front door. I'm assuming 
you have the earlier credit unit and you are pushing the pulse generator 
wiper, not the wiper found in the later style credit units.

If your credit light is not lit (assuming the bulb is good), the pulse 
generator motor has not moved the wiper to the credit position. Check the 
main credit switch (two leaf switches) to see that they are making. Don't 
eyeball them, check with an ohmmeter with power off. If they are OK, there 
are two more switches to check.

For the pulse generator to move the wiper from home to credit, the circuit 
runs through the normally closed contacts on the letter stepper "home" 
switch in the pulse converter. It also runs through one side of the motor 
control switch ( a set of two leaf switches right beside the pulse generator 
motor). After the wiper moves off the credit position rivet, power is 
transferred to the other set of switches on the motor control switch to 
complete one revolution. We know this part of the switch is good, since it 
pulses on it's own after you push the wiper by hand.

In the past, I had problems with sticky plungers and "S" shaped levers in 
the credit unit. Not a fun chore to work on in such a small area. Also, the 
cam and lever action for the motor control switch is not too swift - the 
lever usually digs a groove into the cam making it difficult to adjust the 
switches for proper action. Good luck,

Jim Dirksen

Not sure what you mean buy accumulator or standard. I am referring to the 
credit unit and keypad combo located at the top/right/ front of the box. The 
wiper arm is the one in the credit unit. Yes about the pin, once the wiper 
arm in the credit unit starts to rotate (after a bump from me) then it makes 
the correct pulses from the converter and all other operations work fine.
