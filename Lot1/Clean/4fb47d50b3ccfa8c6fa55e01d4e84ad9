It may be true that on some particular phone, a "bar" is 6dB.  I wouldn't
count on that being any sort of standard.

The near field effects of putting one phone near another are complicated.
You would see a much more complicated picture if you looked at moving that
phone to various positions in a cubical grid around the reference phone,
against a signal from a reference antenna out many meters.  Another
interesting experiment would be to create a low loss resonant circuit with
simply a loop and tuning capacitor, load that, and repeat the gridding.
The second phone, in the near field, is also acting as part of the antenna
system of the reference phone.

I don't think your lunar thought experiment scales very well, there are
many orders of magnitude difference in the ratio of wavelength vs
obstructor.
