No; the *technology* exists. And it *has* existed for at least the last 
couple decades!

There have been plenty of demonstration vehicles that could go hundreds 
of miles on a charge, and be recharged fast enough to drive as far as 
any normal person would drive an ICE in a day. The Solectria Sunrise 
went 375 miles on a charge in 1996. And there are lots of other examples 
if you look. Just google "electric vehicle range records" for a taste 
(and that only finds the ones in the last decade or so; older ones 
predated the internet).

The problem is not technology; it's that a) there is no public demand 
for such vehicles, so b) no auto company has produced the vehicles.

That's certainly the case today. You can only do it with hand-built 
prototypes, or with elaborate planning as a marketing stunt.

The infrastructure is already there, if you can charge from ordinary 
outlets. (But of course, the auto companies would prefer that people 
believe you must only use their special charging stations).

The cover of Mike Brown's book "Why Wait For Detroit" says it all. If we 
wait for Detroit (or Japan etc.) we are going to be waiting a long LONG 
time.

You can have one today. Buy an old mini-pickup. Remove the ICE stuff, 
and install a series motor, adapter, and controller. Spend the rest of 
your budget on big lithium cells. Fill the bed with them, and you're 
there! :-)

Yes; exactly! Americans may *say* they want EVs (or more likely, ICEs 
that get 100mpg). But they won't pay anything extra for them. They 
expect them to be magically produced for no more cost than the same old 
stuff they've always bought!

As long as consumers won't pay more to buy them, the automakers won't 
pay more to produce them, so these cars won't exist.

The microcomputer revolution only began when there were enough pioneers 
willing to spend large amounts for little computers. This funded the 
small innovative companies, and allowed them to survive and grow, so 
they could *produce* better products.
