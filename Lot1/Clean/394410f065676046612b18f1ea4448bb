Subject:Re: [Flexradio] 10 MHz input to FLEX-1500
Ron,
I can't help you with transverters, but I do have a Flex-1500 and have never
had a problem running from TBolts or a DEMI 10-4.  Here are my 10 MHz
amplitude readings, measured by a HP 53131A Counter set to 50 ohm input.
These amplitudes are zero-to-peak Volts. 

TBolt-A	1.09		
TBolt-B	1.19
TBolt-C	1.39

DEMI 10-4 (with 50 ohm loads on all output ports)
Port A	1.30
Port B	1.32
Port C	1.32
Port D	1.32

These amplitudes range from +11 dBm to + 13 dBm

Subject: [Flexradio] 10 MHz input to FLEX-1500

I hooked up a 10 MHz source to my FLEX-1500 and my two 
DEMI transverters (L144-28HP and L432-28HP). I heard satellite
stations on both FO-29 and VO-52. But when I tried 
transmitting, I got no drive from the FLEX. After a lot of fiddling around. 
I noticed that if I used an 18" BNC jumper connected with a barrel to a 36" 
BNC jumper, the FLEX produced output, but with either jumper alone, I got 
nothing. Why?

I have the 10 MHz source (Trimble Thunderbolt) connected to a DEMI 10-4
amplifier/filter/4-way splitter. Without the DEMI splitter, I get drive from

the FLEX. But with the splitter, I needed the two cables in series. Do you
suppose I 
am getting too much 10 MHz signal from the splitter for the FLEX-1500? 
And the extra cable length gave me some attenuation?

Is the drive level of the 10 MHz signal to the FLEX-1500 critical? 

Ron
