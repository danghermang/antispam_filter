Subject:[Birding-Aus] Yellow Chat Images
Hi all,

We are now starting DNA studies of Capricorn Yellow Chats. The aims include finding out how long this population has been separated from the nominate sub-species, 
which is at its nearest occurrence in SW Queensland, and if there is any genetic separation betwen our two local macgregori sub-populations.
Having seen nominate Yellow Chats at 3 sites in NW Australia, it seems clear that breeding males there have quite different plumage to the Capricorn birds.
The Alligator River sub-species also look very similar to the NW birds. 

Does anyone have images of males from SW Qld in or near breeding plumage? 
We would like to confirm that these are consistent with nominate plumage at the other end of the range.

Thanks, Bob Black
