Subject:[Hsqldb-user] Temporary tables: Creating and selecting in single
	query
I am having trouble trying to both create temporary table and run a
select over it in a single query. My query looks something like this:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS foo
DECLARE LOCAL TEMPORARY TABLE foo AS (
    select * from ...
) WITH DATA

SELECT * FROM foo

This returns the error: "user lacks privilege or object not found: FOO"

If I include semicolons after each part of the query it runs fine.
However, I am trying to get this query to run on a very old version of
Elixir Reports which seems to ignore the use of semicolons.
Can anyone recommend another approach to this situation?

It's worth noting that I have many of these queries to refactor and
they are much more complex than the simplified one above, and I don't
want to have to rewrite them too much if possible.
