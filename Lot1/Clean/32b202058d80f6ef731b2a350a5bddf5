Subject:[Dixielandjazz] Bude Jazz Festival 2012
Unfortunately I have sent the draft, with a friend's corrections, but
also with the entire correpondence.  Instead of saving it in drafts, I
inadvertently clicked "send," and then it was too late!
John Hallam was born in 1947, so I guess he is not all THAT young
(even if a few years younger than I), certainly not a new star.
But since it's gone, I am not going to correct it now.
Cheers
