Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas

From experiments, a coil has less inductance when it is near the ends
of the rod, which shows that some flux must escape from the sides of
the rod as well.  So it must be right that coupling is less between
separate parts along the length of the rod, as you said.
