Horrible
One birder earlier this year reported seeing a Red-bellied WP fall out of a tree with this kind of dart in it in CENTRAL PARK

Someone has been hunting and killing birds in the Bronx using a dart gun. See this article:

If you bird in Pelham Bay Park (or anywhere around the city, for that matter), be on the lookout for any suspicious activity. Do not attempt to intervene yourself, but rather, call the city's 311 line to report it.

Thanks.
