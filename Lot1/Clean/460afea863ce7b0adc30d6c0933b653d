Subject:[Chelsea] Suarez to City, so Falcao to Chelsea?
Three papers (at least) have this story, seemingly coming from City
but actually reported by the Liverpool-based writers of each paper.
Seperately from these articles there seem to be whispers from
(non-journo) people with CFC contacts that Falcao is being pursued -
some going further than that. It's certainly the rumours going round,
even if those rumours end up far from being true. Anyway, make what
you will of them...
