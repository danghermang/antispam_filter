Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] 1/2-wave vertical really needs a ground
	plane?
Computer simulation programs are normally able to calculate the length
 of a dipole very accurately, provided that all the variables and 
elements that affect the operation of the dipole can be entered 
accurately so that the simulation is realistic and therefore accurate. 
The major problem is normally being able to enter the real-life 
environmental data accurately to enable a realistic simulation to be 
undertaken.

For various ratios of wire diameters to Lambda, the real length of the subject dipole is between 76.2 and 79 meters.

Not enough coffee this morning it is actually 76.33 meters.
