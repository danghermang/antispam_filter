Subject:[burners] Flyer for Slutcracker, get free ticket!
Pull on your kinky boots and slip into that tight little number- we need
you sexy lads and lasses to strut the streets of Boston (and surrounding
areas) to bring Slutcracker to the people.

Typically we flyer entrance and exit crowds of shows - YES this means
possibly flyering for short periods of time during the evenings/weekends.
We personally hand each flyer to a potential attendant. We are looking for
reliable, outgoing, motivated volunteers to represent Slutcracker!!

EXCHANGE RATE: SHIFTS TO FREE TICKET RATIO!
four 30-40 minute shifts = 1 comp ticket
a 3-hour shift (outside Bizarre Bazaar, for example) = 1 comp ticket

You can earn as many tickets as is physically possible, but this is the
minimum to get a comp, which I assume is one of the main reasons you're
volunteering.

Please complete this form and we will get in touch with you!

volunteering please email me directly!
