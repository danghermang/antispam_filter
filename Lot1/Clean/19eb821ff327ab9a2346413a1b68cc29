Subject:[meteorite-list]  CM1 sale
 Hi All I am posting this for John as he still has a few CM1 specimens left
 I  Just received my little piece of  Moapa Valley CM1 Carbonaceous 
Chondrite that Sonny Clay found.
It is the only CM1 found in the United States making it a world class 
specimen for sure
Moapa Valley is the only CM1 Carbonaceous Chondrite material available to 
the public. My close meteorite hunting buddy John has 2 more small pieces at 
great price a .7 and .8   if any one is looking to add to there collection 
let me know & will put you in contact with him. Please contact off list. 
Have a great day

Scott Johnson
