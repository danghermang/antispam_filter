Just curious...anyone using the latest version of VAC. =A0I used the 4.9
version a long time because 4.10 was buggy with the Flex. =A0I upgraded to
4.11 since the consensus of the group was that it was fully functional. =A0=
No
problems here. =A0Now that 4.12 is out I haven't heard anything on it. =A0M=
aybe
it doesn't have any significant improvements or changes. =A0I'm just usually
in the habit of keeping all my software up to date as long as it's proven to
work consistently. =A0What say you all?
