Subject:[Birding-Aus] Long-tailed Honey Buzzard photographed on Dauan
Hello all,
             On Saturday the 20 October our group photographed a Long-tailed Honey Buzzard AKA Long-tailed Buzzard or Papuan Honey Buzzard (Henicopernis longicauda) soaring over the  hillside on Dauan Island in the Northern Torres Strait. 

Long-tailed Honey Buzzard is a widespread and common resident through out coastal PNG and adjacent island, thus it's not surprising that it should appear on Dauan which is only 5km from the PNG coastline.

BARC sub forthcoming.  First Australian record.

Cheers
Richard Baxter
