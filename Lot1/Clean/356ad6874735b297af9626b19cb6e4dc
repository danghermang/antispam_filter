Meeting: Manifesto for Teaching Online

The authors of the Manifesto for Teaching Online, led by Clara O=92Shea,
will discuss the Manifesto on Tuesday 13 November 12 noon SL time (8pm
UK time, see http://tinyurl.com/d3m6bzs for times elsewhere) on
Infolit iSchool, in the virtual world Second Life, (the location is
http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Infolit%20iSchool/132/239/22 ).
It will be a fascinating meeting! ALL WELCOME!

The Manifesto for Teaching Online is a series of brief statements that
attempt to capture what is generative and productive about online
teaching, course design, writing, assessment and community. It was
produced by Jen Ross, Clara O=92Shea, Sian Bayne and Hamish Macleod
members of the programme team on the MSc in E-learning at the
University of Edinburgh, Scotland, and has attracted a lot of interest
and debate.
The manifesto is online at
http://onlineteachingmanifesto.wordpress.com/ and we are also
developing an inworld exhibit.
