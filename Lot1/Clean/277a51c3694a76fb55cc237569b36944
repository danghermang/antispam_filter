Subject:[Birding-Aus] Gibraltar Range, NSW fire & birds
Hi Birders,

 

Thanks to Greg for the excellent Clarence Valley birding update, a good
twitchathon total illustrating the biodiversity of the area. While they were
enjoying the birds & wildlife, Monica & I were fighting the fire, along with
many other volunteers mentioned, which encroached on Gibraltar Reserve, just
a bit. It's burned over 4000 hectares locally and we've managed to save our
forest (including habitat for many of the species mentioned). It was 37
degrees and dangerous, I found myself running towards the fire to put out a
spot-over at one point, and could have fried an egg on the firetruck window,
so many thanks to all the other RFS volunteers, crews and NSW NPWS for
assistance. All safe now. 

So we've still got Masked Owl, Wompoo F-Dove, King Quail, Lewin's Rail etc
and all the rainforest species, although the wetland is a bit diminished due
to heli-tankers refilling; diary & video here

Happy cool birding,
