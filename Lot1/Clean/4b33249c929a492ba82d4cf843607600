Subject:Re: [burners] [OT] Help turning scanned sheet music into midi or mp3
Thanks all for the multitude of links.  The problem is that there is a
*multitude of links* and no clear winner.  Suggestions today:

http://audiveris.kenai.com/index.html (most suggested)
http://www.finalemusic.com/notepad/default.aspx
http://musescore.org/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/openomr/
http://www.visiv.co.uk/
http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/04/17/snapnplay-this-android-app-reads-sheet-music-and-plays-it-back-to-you/
http://www.myriad-online.com/en/products/pdftomusic.htm

Some of these don't work with .jpgs, others don't play "triplets, rests, or
grace notes," others require you to pay to use certain features, others
just don't work according to various reviews.  The top one looks the most
promising, but it doesn't appear to have a playback method for the music -
it just scans it and reads it, then leaves you to go find some other
software to turn its output into actual sounds.  Another round of software
to try out! If you're an aspiring software developer looking for an
unsolved challenge, this sheet music thing seems to be in demand yet
lacking a good solution.

Fortunately, Jester and Dewb have offered to give it a go on my behalf
(thanks guys!) I'll report back when there's something to report...

Alternately, if you're a pianist and can simply read and play the music
with no effort, how about we make a quick youtube video?

Jason
