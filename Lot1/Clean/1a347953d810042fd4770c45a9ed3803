Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Re report of Glossy Ibis on Eremaea 's Central &
 Southern Queensland page.
Brisbane is quite abnormal amongst cities of the world in having an =

exceptionally large area under the control of one council. In a more =

normal city, like Melbourne, each "suburb" has its own council. In =

practical terms, Fortitude Valley is to Brisbane as St Kilda is to =

Melbourne, yet politically, St Kilda is in a more similar position to =

Murrumba Downs than to Fortitude Valley. I doubt many would complain =

about St Kilda being spoken of as a suburb of Melbourne! So by common =

usage, I would argue that a suburb usually will have its own council.

So I will argue no crime was committed, and the author is to be =

commended for helping readers to understand what was meant.

Cheers, Chris.
