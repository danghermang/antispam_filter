      The top 10 mistakes on SQL Server discussed in this white paper cover
      some of the biggest and most prevalent problems that I've encountered
      in scores of applications developed in IT shops of all sizes and with
      IT staff of all experience levels.

      You will be able to apply lessons learned from these mistakes to your
      current and future IT projects on Microsoft SQL Server and avoid
      problems that have plagued countless other applications.

      By doing so, you will elevate your credibility and competence in the
      eyes of the business people you serve.

   Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) has had a solid, three-year
   history tracking AccelOps, a pioneering software developer that enables
   network and security administrators to monitor performance,
   availability and events with just one application.

   They found that AccelOps customers are enjoying unique benefits in
   terms of time to value, scope of value, and cohesiveness in performance
   and security management thanks to the AccelOps's premium on pragmatic
   innovations.

   This report provides a current view of AccelOps' capabilities in
   industry context, including interview excerpts with three AccelOps
   customers.

Continuous availability
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a10/5613a/4dc/11576af7?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   It is essential for IT to provide applications and services that are
   always up and always on. Windows Server 2012 provides high service
   uptime, new capabilities which can endure many failures transparently -
   without interrupting service - and faster recovery when failures do
   occur. These features help improve the availability of individual
   servers, clusters, and even across datacenters.

   To maximize business productivity, efficiency, and service levels, IT
   should make applications, services, and information continuously
   available and resilient to failures. Resource pooling of compute,
   storage, and network resources into virtualized private cloud
   environments can provide resiliency against hardware failures. Windows
   Server provides improved resiliency for your workloads, including
   features which can endure many failures transparently, and help you
   recover quickly when failures do occur.
