Subject:[bcp] This week's Nighttime Phoenixville Dog Ride will be on
 THURSDAY instead of WEDNESDAY
Due to Halloween and the lingering cleanup from the storm, this week's ride is being moved from Wednesday night to Thursday night.

As usual, the ride will start at 8:00 pm and go until 10:00 pm, departing from the Reynolds Dog Park on Longford Road in Mont Clare, just across the river from Phoenixville.  Here is a link to the starting location:

Strap on the lights, wear your reflective clothing, be bright and garish, and come ride in the dark. We ride on roads with very little traffic.  This ride is slower than the typical B ride, but is listed as B- because there is more climbing than the typical C ride. We regroup after hills.

Regards,
