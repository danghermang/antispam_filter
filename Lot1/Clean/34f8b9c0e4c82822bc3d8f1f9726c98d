Subject:Re: [child_lit] NY/NJ Child_lit folks

Hi Leda, Well, along with millions of others, we have no power, hot water, telephone service, and cell phones don't work at home.  But, thank goodness for local library--a warming center and battery-power provider.  Gas is a problem, too.  We have been told where we live that we may have to wait one-two weeks for power to be restored.  Trees down everywhere--but we were lucky. 80 ft. tulip tree in the garden but it missed the house. Hope others are  surviving.  Hilary
