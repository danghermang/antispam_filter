Subject:[CT Birds] Stratford loop
From Frank & Linda Mantlik
10/28- Stratford- a quick drive of the Lordship Loop- Am. Bittern, 3 Am. Coots at Birdseye boat ramp. Lot is already flooded, and I suspect road leading to it will soon be.
Very high tides already. 
Long Beach access was just being prohibited by a police car; seems like they might lock the gate soon.
Seawall- 1 Com Loon, usual gulls seem during 5 minute look.
Coastal homeowners are boarding up windows,  filling sandbags. etc.
