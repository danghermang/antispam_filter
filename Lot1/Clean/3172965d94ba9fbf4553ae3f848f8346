Subject:[Coral-List] Nikon D70 available.
I have a Nikon D70 with a Sea&Sea housing that I will donate to anybody 
(almost) that wants it.
Sue Drafahl (UW photographer of some renown) told me several years ago 
that she thought the D70 was be best camera she had used.  That was 
several years ago.
 
But: There is no port, no lenses, no strobes.

If you are interested, send me a note.
