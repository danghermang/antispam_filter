Subject:Symposium "Processes and mechanisms of Cenozoic climate and environmental
 change in Southeast Asia" (SAGE 2013, Berlin, Germany)
Dear Colleagues,

I would like to draw your attention to the symposium "Processes and 
mechanisms of Cenozoic climate and environmental change in Southeast 
Asia" at the 2nd Southeast Asian Gateway Evolution Meeting, March 11-15, 
2013, Berlin, Germany (SAGE 2013).

DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS AND EARLY REGISTRATION: 15 December 
2012


Description:

The modern climate of Southeast (SE) Asia is governed by a complex 
monsoon system and influenced by various modes of variability, like the 
El Niño/Southern Oscillation or the Indian Ocean Dipole. The interaction 
between these different climatic phenomena is poorly understood. Even 
less is known about variations in SE Asian climate and their forcing 
factors in the geological past. Proxy-based reconstructions and 
numerical model simulations are crucial in order to improve our 
understanding of the mechanisms that control regional climate 
variability and the processes that drove changes in the past.

This session aims at bringing together scientists from different fields 
dealing with past climate, ocean and environmental variability in the SE 
Asian region. We invite contributions that provide new insights into the 
Cenozoic development of climatic, oceanic and environmental changes 
using all sorts of proxy data and/or numerical models. We welcome 
submissions that elucidate potential forcing mechanisms of regional 
climate and environmental change during the Paleogene, Neogene, and 
Quaternary.
