Subject:[child_lit] Libraries damaged by Sandy?
Hello everyone,

Greenwich Country Day School sponsors a book drive each year to benefit
local organizations that are interested in getting books into the hands of
children.

We get hundreds of terrific middle grade and YA books in very good
condition, (pre-screened by professional librarians) and were wondering if
there are organizations with an even greater need this year due to Sandy's
damage.

We can provide transportation, and storage until the institution is ready
to receive the books.

If you know of an organization that could benefit, please call or reply.

Thanks,

Sarah Abercrombie
