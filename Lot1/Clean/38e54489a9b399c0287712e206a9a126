 That wasn't the question - but be rest assured that I do my fair share
to get wheezy out; I am quite sure you are aware of that fact.

 Do I understand you correctly that you like to imply that there seems
to be a certain overlap within the release team and the buildd team that
hinders the buildd team to set up the chroots currently?  While we don't
seem to be able to address this on short term, it might be an issue in
the longer run, if some core teams only consist of the same people and
thus are blocking each other at such times.

 The real question still holds:  Is there anything one can do to help
the buildd team to reduce the pain involved with the "do not currently
scale on the buildd side" issue?  From what I have been told it seems to
have existed at the squeeze release time already (and probably before)
and is still biting.

 Thanks,
Rhonda
