Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] A Murmuration of Starlings
Jim
I saw (and heard) this phenomenon at dusk whilst visiting Fivebough Swamp in 
Leeton (NSW Riverina) in May 2002. As I agree with Carl Clifford's comment 
("Trying to control starlings, like most avian pest species, is rather like 
putting your hand into a bucket of water, pulling it out again and expecting 
to see a hole in the water."), I suspect that the big flocks are still there 
or nearby.
