Please read the Guide

http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/deployment-chapt.html#dec_nio_access

For an existing database, increase the NIO SIZE in you .script file
before opening the database. For a new database, execute the statement
before inserting the data.

Your system has more than enough memory to speed up your database
access, especially with a 64 bit JVM.

Got visibility?
Most devs has no idea what their production app looks like.
