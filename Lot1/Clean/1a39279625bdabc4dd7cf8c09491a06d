Subject:[Jukebox-list] Anybody in Nashville?
I have a friend looking for a jukebox repair person in the Nashville area. Not sure of the exact model but pretty sure it is a 60s to mid-70's Rock-Ola (pre-computer model).
Told her I'd ask. Any volunteers I might put her in touch with?
thanks in advance,
Ed
