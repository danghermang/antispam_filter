Subject:[Birding-Aus] Black-throated Finch?
You may be aware of the fight to save the Bimblebox Reserve and I have
recently been analyzing audio-sensors to determine the presence of
Black-throated Finch. Although I have no experience of this species in the
wild I think I may have finally found such evidence so I'm hoping that I
can call on Birding-Aus 'knowledge-base' to confirm it.
Visit my Audio site <http://www.aviceda.org/audio/?p=267> (on
http://www.aviceda.org/audio/?p=267) and listen to the audio-clip with the
blue-link.

Please remember that this is a 'sensitive-issue' so it might be more
productive to contact me directly and not publicly.

'Fingers-crossed'
