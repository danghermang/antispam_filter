Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Update on Franklin Gull Please
I went to look for it today - Tuesday - with zero luck. Spent all day in 
Paynesville, centering on the car park over the road from the Hardware 
store, as well as checking every other gull I could find in the general 
Paynesville area. The car park is on Slip Street, easy to find with 
google maps.

If you happen to find it Scott, could you please post it here and I will 
look again on Thursday? Cheers.

Danged if I believe this wretched bird exists - dipped every time I've 
looked.
