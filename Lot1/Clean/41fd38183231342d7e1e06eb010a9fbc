Subject:Re: [rescue] Blue screen of Basic
So, for those that hadn't heard of it, the computer on these screenshots:
http://raspberry-python.blogspot.com/2012/10/blue-screen-of-basic.html

is a Pocket Mini Computer. It is based on a propeller P8X32A board,
with a vga output. I'll be adding the extra 32KB when I receive the
chips. I detailed what is in the kit here:

and from there, is a link to the actual build.
