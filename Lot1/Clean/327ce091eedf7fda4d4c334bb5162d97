Subject:Re: [EVDL] DC motors
That is not a "safety" issue.  It is a SAFETY ISSUE!!!!!

DO NOT DO THIS!!!!  We are talking about a chainsaw.  Who cares about the
switch?  Only one way to find out if it will fail or not.  That is a tiny
issue.   Having the chainsaw at FULL throttle is NOT a viable option.  I am
a certified feller and use a chainsaw regularly.  Even a pro sawyer with
full protective gear would NEVER do this.  Please, please, please.  Killing
yourself to save a "switch" is beyond stupid.  You don't even know it will
fail.  That is pure speculation without knowing the specs of the switch
used in production.
