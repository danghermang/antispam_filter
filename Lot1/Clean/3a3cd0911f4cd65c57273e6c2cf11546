Im sure you are all dying to hear the latest news on Forssell so I'll 
oblige. ;)

A week ago Forssell (now 31y) declined a deal with Notts County and signed 
for the Finnish champions HJK whom he played for as a youngster before 
Chelsea. Last season Forssell played for Leeds mainly as a sub but failed 
to score in 15 games. His last competitive club goal was scored during 
season 2008-09 for Hanover so Forssell is a big risk. However he should 
generate some interest in Finland for returning home after 14 years 
abroad. I believe he still has occasional problems with his knees and HJK 
play on artificial turf so I fear the worst (again).

HJK proudest moment was in 1998 when they played Champions League group 
stage (netting 4 points). Forssell played 44 mins in those games. 
HJK have now been the Finnish champions four times in a row but cant get 
even to Europa league group stage. That is why manager Antti Muurinen was 
recently sacked. HJK's best game in UCL recently was in 2011 against 
Schalke whom they beat 2-0 at home but lost 6-1 away. This season they 
went out against Celtic (lost both games 2-1a, 2-0h). The new season 
starts next spring.
