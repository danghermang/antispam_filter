Thanks Greg and Steve for the ID help.  I think you are right now that I
look at them again.  I saw a few greater yellow legs at the marsh pond
nearby earlier.

Kind of a tough angle but I'd say Greater Yellowlegs. Last time I was there
I saw Greaters and Pectoral Sands in Boulder Pool. Both have yellow legs,
but the bills seem too big for Pecs. The lead bird's bill actually seems a
tad upturned.
