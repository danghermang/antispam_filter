Subject:Re: [Flexradio] PSDR and Windows 8 upgrade
It works fine - for me....  I have a dual SSD boot machine with Win 8 64 and Win 7 64.   Everything
runs without issue.  VAC, PowerSDR, Virtual Com Ports etc, Mini Deluxe, DDUTIL etc etc etc.
I've been running the Beta for a while, last week I transitioned the Beta to the Retail version
from MSDN.    Not found a single app that I use that won't work as I expect.

And I am loving the Metro interface from a development point of view...  but I am a Windows Phone
developer too....so it meets my needs.   YMMV.

For running your Flex and it's associated applications, there is no
advantage over Win7-64.

They made some significant changes to the GUI, removed the start
button, replacing it with a brand new full screen start screen, moved
a bunch of stuff around, etc. Personally, I find important parts of it
awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse.

I would read some reviews on the internet before upgrading your
computers. If you do choose to upgrade, do an image backup of your
Win7 system ahead of time, so you can get it back if you don't like
Win8. Better yet, install it on a spare hard drive and evaluate it
there first.

I use it every day at work out of necessity and have no desire to
upgrade my Win7 system at home. My Flex and every other piece of
software I use is running fine, nothing gained by rocking the boat.
