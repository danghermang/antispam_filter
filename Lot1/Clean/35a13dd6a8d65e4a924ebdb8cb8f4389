W3C Workshop: Do Not Track and Beyond

   20 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9571

   W3C announced today a Workshop on Do Not Track and Beyond,
   26-27 November in Berkeley, California. W3C is currently
   creating standards that define mechanisms for expressing user
   preferences around Web tracking. The Working Group has produced
   drafts of Do Not Track specifications, concurrent with various
   implementations in browsers and Web sites and heightened press
   and policymaker attention. At the same time, public awareness
   of online privacy issues has increased.

   Workshop participants will discuss the Consortium's next steps
   in the area of tracking protection and Web privacy. What have
   we learned from Do Not Track standardization and real-world
   implementations? What should we look at next and beyond DNT?

   There is no fee to participate in this Workshop and W3C
   Membership is not required. All participants are required to
   submit a position paper by 19 October and space is limited. W3C
   thanks UC Berkeley and TRUST Science and Technology Center for
   hosting the meeting, and Yahoo! for sponsoring the event. Learn

   An updated Working Draft of "Website Accessibility Conformance
   Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM)" was published today by the
   Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG)
   and Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERT WG), through
   the joint WCAG 2.0 Evaluation Methodology Task Force ( Eval TF
   ). WCAG-EM describes an approach for evaluating how websites --
   including web applications and websites for mobile devices --
   conform to WCAG 2.0. Learn more from the call for review e-mail
   and about the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).

   The Web Applications Working Group invites implementation of
   the Candidate Recommendation of "The WebSocket API." This

W3C Invites Implementations of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module

   20 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9568

   The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites
   implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of "CSS Flexible
   Box Layout Module." The specification describes a CSS box
   model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout
   model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any
   direction, and can "flex" their sizes, either growing to fill
   unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both
   horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily
   manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside
   vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build
   layouts in two dimensions. Learn more about the Style Activity.

Publishing and Linking on the Web Draft Published

   18 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9565

   The Technical Architecture Group has published the First Public
   Working Draft of "Publishing and Linking on the Web." This
   document is intended to inform future social and legal
   discussions of the Web by clarifying the ways in which the
   Web's technical facilities operate to store, publish and
   retrieve information, and by providing definitions for
   terminology as used within the Web's technical community. This
   document also describes the technical and operational impact
   that does or could result from legal constraints on publishing,
   linking and transformation on the Web. Comments should be sent
   before end of september 2012, for consideration during the
   upcoming TAG meeting. This is not a deadline, comments can be
   sent anytime. Learn more about the Technical Architecture
   Group.

       http://www.w3.org/2012/08/web-and-automotive/
       Rome, Italy
       Hosted by Intel and Sponsored by Webinos
       W3C’s Open Web Platform (OWP) is driving this and other
       industry transformations. The promise of the early
       information superhighway is being fulfilled. Whether
       tethering a driver’s smartphone or tablet to work with a
       car--or embedding technology into the car itself--there’s
       no need to reinvent the wheel. The Web can take you there.
       Participants in this workshop will have the opportunity to
       share their own perspectives, requirements, and ideas to
       ensure that emerging global technology standards meet the
       needs of the Web and Automotive industries.

       This workshop serves as a forum for the W3C membership and

       privacy on the Web platform cannot end with Do Not Track:
       what should we look at next and beyond DNT?
