Subject:[Coral-List] Nikon D70 Availability.
Hi List,

Just to let everyone know, I have not forgotten about the D70 I promised 
to donate.  I have narrowed down the over 150 requests to what I 
consider the top 30.

It will take me a while to reach a final decision, but I am quite busy 
just now.  Please be patient.

John
