If you have enough processing power you can sort-of get it to work with the
1500. But performance is poor and if you do anything over on the MacOS side
of things, it gets really bad fast. None of the virtualization packages
support FireWire. The solution is running BootCamp and dual-boot the Mac to
run PowerSDR.

I can't answer that but it seems to be that many are running Windows 8.
Perhaps others will respond.
