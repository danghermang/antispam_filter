Subject:[Flexradio] SDRDataTransfer v5.1.0 Released
SDRDataTransfer v5.1.0 has been released & is available for download from my
website.

When writing my BandText Editor utility, I realized that the BandText table
can be replaced, but it should never be transferred.  Version 5.1.0 of
SDRDataTransfer implements this rule.

IMPORTANT:  All users of SDRDataTransfer are encouraged to upgrade to v5.1.0
immediately to prevent the BandText table from being corrupted during the
transfer process.
