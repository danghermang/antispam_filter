I know because I have quite a few allocations, and trying to get them all up to 80% utilization is like tacking jello to the wall.  Not a fun exercise.  You have my +1.

Not necessarily opposed, but one reason for the existing language is: if you are at 90% of a /16, and your 3 month need is only for a /20, then you would still be at >80% immediately after getting your /20, without using a bit of it. If you have to use 80% (or even 50%) of all allocations, that eliminates that loophole.
