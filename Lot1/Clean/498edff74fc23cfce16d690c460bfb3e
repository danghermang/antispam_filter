Subject:Re: [EVDL] Cross Country EV?
Installing four DC-DC converters in my EV, I had to mounted way in the back 
of the EV attach to the outside of the enclosed fiberglass battery box.

It is always best to tap off the main battery pack ahead of the shunt that 
is use for the E-meter.  The problem I have is the shunt was mounted in the 
front of the EV which is about a 25 foot run of cable from the converters. 
The total run of cable would be 25 foot from the shunt, 25 foot run back to 
the converters for the high voltage side and then another 25 foot back to 
the front for the 12 volt side.

Instead of doing a 75 foot circuit run, I just tap off the battery pack 
which was only 4 foot from the main battery with a fuse and contactors to 
the converter thinking the DC-DC converter load will not show up on the 
E-meter.

I also use a 9 to 15 volt and a 0-100 amp Stewart Warner meters on this 
circuit.  When I first turn on the Zilla 12 volt control power and three 
contactors, the main battery pack load was indicated on the E-meter.

I then turn on the DC-DC converters which show the 12 volt and ampere 
indicating on the 12 volt and amp meters. This also show a rise of amperes 
on the E-Meter of the main battery pack which I thought would not happen.

For some reason the E-Meter is reading the main battery input load to the 
converters, even though the main battery tap off is between the E-meter 
shunt and main battery.

If you think about it, the main battery pack positive, E-meter shunt, motor 
controller, motor, and the main battery pack negative is in one series loop 
or what we call a circle or circuit and the DC-DC converter taps off 
parallel any place in that circuit in that circuit draws power from the main 
battery will show that DC-DC converter load on the E-meter or NOT?
