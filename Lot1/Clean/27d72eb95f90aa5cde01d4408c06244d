Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] AD: MUST SEE!! Kentland Melt and Glover Bluff
	Impactites
Hi Brandon and List,

Those melt specimens are awesome!  :)

A suggestion to anyone reading this - check out these impactite
specimens.  I have some of these Kentland and Glover Bluff pieces, and
they are killer specimens.  I'm 100% happy with them.  Brandon does a
great job on the cutting and polishing.

Best regards,

MikeG
