Thanks for responding so quickly Jeff,

Is yours a Rock-Ola 507 as it isn't mentioned on that site,  if so which one 
did you use?


Can't use Radio Shack in the UK and we're on 230 volt anyway.

Bob.

I just put one of these together in the US - 3W1 - with a kit from 
CDADAPTER.com.
Got my power supply local at the RShack.
Went together nicely and worked great!
