Subject:[child_lit] The Mayor of Salinas speaks in support of libraries,
	WHOLE thing this time
Messed it up AGAIN.  Sorry

--

Mayor Dennis Donohue
Speaking at
California Library Association Conference 2012
I am an =93accidental Mayor=94. I often tell people there are three stories
about how I became the Mayor of Salinas and one of them is actually
true.
The most true is that I =93cut my political teeth=94 on local tax measures =
in
the City of Salinas, in various roles as part of my service on the Salinas
Chamber of Commerce Executive Board and ultimately as Chair.
In 2004, the city failed in its efforts to pass two critical tax measures t=
hat
left the Council with no choice but to shut down virtually all city
services with the exception of police and fire.
The home of John Steinbeck, one of North America=92s six Nobel
Laureates, was literally on the verge of closing its libraries. And then
Salinas in epic fashion responded with a tale that even Steinbeck might
have relished telling.
Those who loved libraries came together in an unprecedented fashion
and organized what became known as Measure V. The effort received
international attention, Hollywood stars came and gave to Salinas=85Bill
Murray donated his AT&T Pro-Am winnings to the libraries, Hector
Elizondo was great in Pretty Woman helping Julia Roberts, he was even
better on the steps of the Caesar Chavez library, and even the Hollywood
Librarian film came to town.
And I was honored to receive this organization=92s President=92s Award for
my role in Measure V. And like all of those who receive awards such as
that I most certainly accepted it on behalf of thousands of people all ages
and backgrounds that helped saved the libraries=85that day=85.for a
decade. And like many great literary works there are still stories to be
told about our libraries because a decade in literary and real time goes
fast!
This weekend we are on the eve of an Election Day that will see if
Measure E will make Measure V permanent. The lessons of working
with so many people in the community =93marked=94 me politically and
personally.
I have been given the honor and opportunity today to bookend my time
as Mayor with a chance to share some of my experiences, a Mayoral
point of view (thank you for that=85..nobody asks anymore now that I am
a lame duck!) and my vision for the future of libraries.
I know first-hand just how vulnerable libraries can be in the current
fiscal era we live=85.particularly in California. All too often the most
vulnerable service these days is the public library. Ironically, library
patrons most likely represent the most potent community force when
they are mobilized.
One of my favorite books is How the Irish Saved Civilization=85.and, not
for the obvious reasons. But think about what the monks did in the
middle ages=85they looked ahead=85and realized they had to save
civilization and copy ancient manuscripts.
So too this generation must look ahead and figure out how to save the
libraries for future generations. In my view, nobody should be under
any illusions about the financial state of affairs of far too many cities in
California.
To be sure there are real financial challenges, but this is not the talk
where I bemoan the loss of Redevelopment Funds yet again, the looming
possibility of claw-backs to cities, the fact we may only be a third of the
way through our foreclosure problem. This is not that talk=85but if
Measure V is not made permanent or extended within a few years
Gollum will be holding the ring not Frodo in Salinas.
One of the things I appreciate about our librarian Elizabeth Martinez is
she and I have shared an =93inevitable destiny=94. It is a concept based on=
 a
mystical New Mexico journey. It is one of those few times when
dreams become real.
During my journey as Mayor with Elizabeth, I truly came to appreciate
the absolute need to stress to Salineans all basic city services have value.
In our city it has become imperative that we break the gridlock of public
safety choices versus parks and libraries.
The budget choice is all too real=85.it will get worse for at least the next
decade=85.unless all of us began to tell a better story. In theory we ought
to be pretty good at telling stories in Steinbeck Country. But you
know=85the book is on my nightstand=85.I intend to read it=85.but it=92s
late=85.I am tired=85and tomorrow looks brighter.
We are at the same crossroads as the monks in Ireland. Library
advocates need to tell their story city by city, and ensure the future of t=
he
institution.
I take a back seat to nobody in a pro-business orientation, and a belief in
the necessity of a strong police department. And I want to be very clear
that by robust I mean a police department that is guided by
neighborhood policing philosophies and strategies that move beyond
community policing.
But I would tell you as a Mayor of a City that has had a significant youth
violence challenge that while I need an excellent police force, I cannot
envision a fundamentally peaceful city that does not have a vibrant
library system.
In fact I would argue that libraries are the strategic city service that can
and should bring the community together everyday around our common
challenges and dreams=85be they economic, public safety, or re-inventing
government.
Let me speak to those elements as a Mayor but pause first to note that
ultimately at the heart of all of this is what libraries are all about. I am
the Mayor of a City with high unemployment, where people work hard
in the fields for their children to have a better future. In short those
fields grow dreams besides lettuce, broccoli, and, of course, not nearly
enough radicchio.
At the heart of all of this is the fact libraries are a place where everybo=
dy
can go and does go, to touch something bigger than themselves. At
libraries, they discover a strength and potential within.
Do you remember the first time a book grabbed you?=85really grabbed
you and you fought to sleep, didn=92t want to go to dinner, everything was
inconvenient but that book. That feeling is what brought Hector
Elizondo to Salinas.
I would submit only libraries can arouse that type of passion and really
unite a community. People ask me what I intend to do after I leave
office. I tell them my focus will be the arts, culture, history because I
have seen what they mean to a community, and libraries house and tell
that shared story.
Now I am not na=EFve about budget realities and the challenges libraries
face=85.so let=92s get down to business for a minute. The public sector now
seemingly lives in a permanent financially crisis driven environment.
Salinas has suffered from structural deficits for over three decades,
wrestles daily with a significant youth violence issue, and is currently
working through the loss of some 850 jobs due to a re-organization
following the acquisition of our largest non-Ag employer by Capital
One.
I need libraries open 7 days a week so families can gather to learn to
read, spend time together, students can do their homework. I want to see
our libraries go on offense, and do as Salinas is doing - create the first
Digital Arts lab in a California public library, partner to introduce a
Coder Dojo coding club to help develop young programmers who we
hope will be the future entrepreneurs of the Salinas Valley=85.which for
all intents and purposes is the fresh southern flank of the Silicon Valley.
Every K-12 student in Salinas has a library card, 86% percent of
residents have library cards, 1800-2000 patrons visit our three libraries
daily, young poets hold slams on Friday nights, 750 programs are
provided a year in the libraries, Snappy the Tortoise was second only to
Paul the Octopus that famed soccer prognosticator in web hits, and the
list goes on, =85including the newly renovated and expanded Caesar
Chavez Library which will be dedicated on December 2nd.
I would further tell you that as a Mayor I know cities don=92t take days
off=85.but our City Hall is only open 4 days a week. I can=92t help but
wonder why I can=92t develop government self-service kiosks for the
residents to get dog licenses, pay fines, get basic permits. If grocery
stores can have automatic tellers why can=92t libraries help with automatic
government?
Frankly no other public institution has more potential to help
communities solve problems, get ready for the future, promote the
common good, and cultivate individual aspiration and dreams, and, =85
oh yes=85.provide a good book=85.whatever form that takes!
My personal vision is that Salinas has the vision and the will to imagine
a Great City, a Great City that is anchored by a great iconic library
=85like Alexandra=92s library in Egypt.
Some Mayors dream of Downtown Ballparks. I spoke of a dream of an
Iconic Library a few years ago at San Jose State University to revitalize
Salinas=92s fortunes. Can anybody here really doubt that, if we built such
an institution, people would come?
I truly believe that at a seminal moment in time when all things around
the written word are changing, that libraries everywhere should be
leading that conversation and saving civilization. All visions have their
time, =85.now is the time for libraries to take the lead, to pivot towards
the future, and embrace their rightful position at the center of our cities.
