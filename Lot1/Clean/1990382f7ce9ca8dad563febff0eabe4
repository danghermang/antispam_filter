Subject:[Birding-Aus] Wandering Whistling-Ducks
I received a report today of about 500 Wandering Whistling-Ducks in the
Murrabit - Noorong area this week.  They are occasional vagrants to the area
in wet years, but I've never heard of them in these numbers before. The rice
crops planted in October are no doubt appealing at this time of year.
