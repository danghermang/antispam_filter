Subject:[Birding-Aus] Zebra finch populations
Hi all,

I am new to Birding Aus so firstly I must apologise if this question has been asked before. I am studying the anti-predator behaviour of wild zebra finches and am having trouble tracking down a suitable population. Can anyone suggest an area in Victoria that has a large, reliable population of zebra finches? Any help given will be much appreciated. If you would like more information about my study please ask.

Thank you!
