Subject:[meteorite-list] NASA SETI Misappropriation of Tax Payer Funds
To All Concerned US Tax Payers...

I have been troubled by what is a clear misappropriation of US tax payer =

funds by NASA/SETI. At a time of this country's financial crisis, this is n=
o =

time to squander our tax dollars!!

We have all seen and read about 'The Blimp" that was, as stated in the =

article link below, "... a NASA-hired airship." Not only are they using a =

privately owned "Blimp" for frivolous and far-fetched 'research', but they =

are also giving free joy rides to private citizens as stated from the =

article, "Glenn Rivera [a private citizen] was invited by astronomers =

[NASA/SETI] to hunt for more meteorite crash-landing sites from a NASA-hire=
d =

airship."

In recent conversations, I and many of my colleagues and some NASA =

scientists (who wish to remain anonymous), have all concluded that finding =

meteorites [of any size] is completely impossible and a waste of tax payer =

dollars! How can one think you can spot a black rock the size of a dime, a =

golf ball or even a basketball from an altitude of 1000 feet?

The only entity that benefits from these dream hunts is the private company =

who owns "The Blimp". They get paid by NASA for use of "The Blimp" and they =

also benefit from all of the free advertising with their logos and web =

addresses emblazoned on the sides of "The Blimp"!

As far as I am concerned, hunting for meteorites floating in the sky is ful=
l =

of hot air!
