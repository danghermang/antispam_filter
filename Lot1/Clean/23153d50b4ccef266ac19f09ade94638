Subject:[Hsqldb-user] HSQL database size limit reached
Large Data support has been introduced in the latest version and allows
the .data file to grow to 128 times the default maximum.

If you use version 2.2.9, or the latest jar snapshot, it should open
this database. Also see the Guide on the hsqldb.large_data property,
which you can before the database reaches the default limit.
