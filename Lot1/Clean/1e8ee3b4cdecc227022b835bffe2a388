Subject:[CT Birds] Old Saybrook birds: Forsters Terns and more
While doing some errands my husband and I stopped at a few Old Saybrook spots this afternoon.  Highlights included:

Cornfield Pt: 7 Forsters Terns, all roosting on some rocks, at least 5 N. Gannets, most likely more

North Cove seen from new park next to town leaf dump:  2 Gadwall

Old Lyme DEP: 7 Green-winged Teal

At home here at the feeders I have 2 Purple Finches tagging along with my very aggressive Siskin flock.
