Hi guys! 

I think it may be from "Animusic -  A computer Animation Video Album DVD".
If not from that particular collection, it is very, very similar in concept
and execution.

Cheers & beers,

Guys - 
 
I have no idea what this is but my wife sent it to me so I am passing it on 
to you. She is a music teacher... Fascinating to watch...
