Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Weird BPSK31 Behavior
I would double check the sample rates between VAC on PowerSDR and on
the VAC lines in the Windows sound settings. If one is set to 48000
and the other to 44100, your signal would not look so good. Perhaps
you're unexplained shutdown reset something. I keep both at 48000.
