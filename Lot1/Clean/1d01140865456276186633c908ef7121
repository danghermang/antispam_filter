Subject:Re: [Dixielandjazz] Chico Hamiliton
Chico also did a "Dixie" recording!

Yank Lawson & Chico Hamilton Ol=E9 Dixie - I have the LP and used to
play it on my radio show. Some of it is actually not too bad ;-)

here is a review (from a used record sales site)
LP (Item 531750) ABC, 1966 =97 Condition: Very Good+
It may be Dixie, but the groove here is plenty darn unique =96 thanks to
some great percussion work by Chico Hamilton, in a mode that really
transforms the sound of the set! Yank's definitely playing with a trad
jazz sound on his horn, but Chico's rhythms have plenty of bossa nova
and Latin touches =96 all of which bring in a very groovy sort of 60s
sound to the record =96 that "old is new again" style that showed up
often in some of the best jazz/easy crossover albums of the time,
including a good number handled by Bob Thiele, who put together this
tasty little record. Cutty Cutshall and Pee Wee Russell are also
working on horns alongside Lawson =96 but the real charm is the rhythm
section, which also includes Bucky Pizzarelli and Willie Bobo! Titles
include "Bossa Nova Noche", "Daydream", "Ka Boom Boom", "Tijuana",
"Where Did I Find You", and "I Cried In The Night".
