   Hello braun as Welcome to this Tech Resources update from The Register

   Versed in Virtual Desktop
   http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/981/5613a/4c7/6f1c91fe?td=3Dm_wpe=

      Distributed computing has been pervasive in IT organisations for near=
ly
      two decades, but the tables are beginning to turn. Virtual Desktop
      Infrastructure (VDI), also known as Hosted Virtual Desktop (HVD), is
      one of the fastest growing trends in IT today, at least in part becau=
se
      of the benefits it offers in management, access, performance and
      security.

      This whitepaper discusses Rackspace's experience in quick deployment
      and hosting of VDI environments.

A Decision Maker's Guide to Hybrid and Cloud Computing
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/983/5613a/4c7/62fa1777?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   More IT organisations are achieving tangible cost efficiencies from the
   intelligent use of cloud computing and hosting solutions. At the same
   time, vendors are busy rebranding their products as cloud or cloud
   enabled solutions. How do you work out what can and will work for your
   organisation?

   This guide cuts through the jargon and gives you a straightforward
   explanation of cloud services, so that you can find the right solution
   to fit your organisations' needs.

Achieving Compliance in Digital Investigations
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9ce/5613a/4c7/70d9a9d3?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   As regulation and litigation increase, internal investigators must
   support an alphabet soup of compliance obligations: SOX, GLBA, FISMA,
   HIPAA, PCI DSS, regional privacy laws, and more. Although each
   regulation is different, reflecting specific risks and markets, these
   laws share common investigation requirements in three areas: policy,
   control infrastructure, and incident response.

   Rather than prepare for and resource each compliance mandate
   separately, this paper demonstrates how in-house investigators can take
   advantage of computer forensics technology that supports these three
   key functions within a single base platform. We show how a common
   investigative infrastructure can enable appropriate investigative
   processes for disparate industry regulations and frameworks, and how it
   takes away the guesswork and reduces the risk. Plus, with this unified
   environment, enterprise teams - including HR, IT, and audit - can be as
   efficient as possible in responding to events and preparing audit- and
   court-ready materials.

   In this effort to comply more successfully and efficiently, remote
   forensics can be a force multiplier. Your limited investigation
   resources can go farther, faster. Trusted by investigators around the
   world, EnCase Enterprise provides a consistent, scalable, industry- and
   litigation-proven framework for investigating fraud, HR and information
   security incidents.

   This report outlines Forrester's future look for mobile security and
   operations. This report is designed to help security and risk (S&R) and
   infrastructure and operations (I&O) executives understand and navigate
   the major business and IT trends that will affect the development of a
   future-proof mobile support strategy.

2e2 Report : Supplier Management and Support
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9e9/5613a/4c7/73e2d71e?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   ICT is increasingly underpinning the business-critical functions of
   most organisations. At the same time supporting the ICT estate is
   becoming more complex and fragmented. What levels of support are
   organisations receiving from vendors and suppliers? Are maintenance and
   support costs increasing? Are organisations finding managing their
   different support and maintenance contracts a challenge?

   This survey was developed to tackle some of these supplier management
   and support questions by gauging the opinion of UK businesses who rely
   heavily on their ICT infrastructure. 2e2 commissioned the survey to
   gain a better understanding of how organisations are currently managing
   their supplier maintenance and support contracts, the challenges they
   are currently facing and whether they feel they are receiving a
   consistent level of ICT support across their business.

   The survey then goes on to investigate how organisations currently
   manage their ICT assets and whether managing them in silos is having a
   detrimental effect on their business. By exploring this, the research
   aims to highlight how many organisations are paying support on hardware
   and software they no longer use. Furthermore, the research shows that
   the majority of organisations do believe that they could reduce
   maintenance, support and overall operational costs if they move towards
   a more standardised ICT infrastructure with fewer suppliers, assuming
   the increased accountability involved in delivering support services.

   200 IT directors within large enterprise organisations were surveyed by
   independent research company Vanson Bourne.
