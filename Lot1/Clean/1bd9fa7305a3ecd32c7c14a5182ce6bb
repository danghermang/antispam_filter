Subject:[CT Birds] birdy year
Here in Enfield, it's my  birdiest year yet, my feeders have been up for 5 years.   I am mobbed with Purple Finches still, Pine Siskins, along with the regulars.   I've seen one Junco and many White-throated sparrows.   My first Juno was thursday, for the record. The hummingbird feeder is still up, in hopes.     Had the first-ever appearance of a White-crowned sparrow.    I've added more feeders to provide more feeding stations.
