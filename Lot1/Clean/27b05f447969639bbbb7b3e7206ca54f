The only change is that Scintilla 3.2.1 added a few more language lexers:
TMCD (whatever that is)

CoffeeScript is now lexed in the SCLEX_COFFEESCRIPT lexer, not the C one

Other obscure languages:
AVS
ECL
OSCRIPT
VISUAL PROLOG (not your grandfather's Prolog, apparently)

Plus most of the difference is in the internal OSX editor.  As a language extension
writer, you shouldn't be affected.  Please let me know if you run into anything.

With Komodo 8 we've also added initial support for Retina displays, with the Komodo editor component being able to show crystal clear fonts under this mode.
