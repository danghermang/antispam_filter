Future-proofing the data centre - Lessons from the front line
11am GMT / 12pm CET, 30th November 2012

Hi Braun As,

Whether it's public, private, or hybrid, there's an emerging consensus
that cloud computing will play a role in the future of IT delivery. But

Do you shift everything to the cloud, or mix delivery models?
Vertical stacks or "plug and play"?
Integrated management, or a heterogeneous environment?

Questions, questions.

Hewlett-Packard's David Chalmers joins Dale Vile from Freeform
Dynamics and The Reg's Tim Phillips to provide answers, answers.
