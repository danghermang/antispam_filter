Subject:[Chelsea] T shirts at the game, any players refuse to wear them?

Just wondered following the controversy with Rio Ferdinand and Jason Robert=
s. I heard some QPR players did not wear them either include Anton.
One thing came to mind when Fergie said he was embarrased by Rio and that h=
e will be dealth with. Was this because he did not do any thing over the mu=
ch publicised Peter Schmeichel/Ian Wright incident where viewers who could =
lip read made complaints to the FA and police but no action was taken?=A0
