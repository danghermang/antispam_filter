Subject:[LUG] Back to the list with a Raspberry PI and a laptop
Hi Guys

Reading the last few emails reminds me why I enjoyed this list. A random selection of topics and one or two that I understand!!!

So I'm back. I bought a Raspberry PI and saw that Paul Sutton is offering PI training. At the same time I thought I ought to catch up with all on the list once again. So here I am back again. I am looking to use the PI as a media centre and to power webcams and upload the pictures. I mention the laptop because I would like to install Linux on it but I actually cannot remember the name of the laptop and it isn't that close.

So, let's deal with the PI. Firstly will the PI mount the webcams as is or will I need to add packages. What webcams would you suggest please?

Thanks.
