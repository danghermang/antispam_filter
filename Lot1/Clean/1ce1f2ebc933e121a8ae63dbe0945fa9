Thanks for all the responses. Not so simple, just as I thought. So
things are only going to get worse. And the government is always
thinking of ways to spy on us.

Education is the way to go, but not just in schools perhaps. I have a
rather hazy understanding of what I should be doing as a minimum to be
reasonably secure. So some suggestions from our more knowledgeable list
members could be useful for many of us I believe.

Thanks
