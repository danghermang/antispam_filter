I'm reluctant to do anything that could even be perceived as a barrier 
for IPv6 adoption.  But, ARIN should be proactive and explicitly offer 
the LRSA when an organization with legacy resources that is applying for 
their IPv6 block.  In this case, they are likely using the fact that 
they have legacy IPv4 as justification for their IPv6 block.  They are 
going to have to sign an RSA for their IPv6 anyway, and the LRSA is 
virtually identical.  It could even be a two for one with their lawyers, 
its really that close.

I think ARIN needs be very proactive on this issue in general, maybe 
even to the point of being a little pushy.  Bringing up the LRSA anytime 
they have business interactions with organizations that have legacy 
resources, especially any business that requires an updated RSA be 
signed anyway.  Maybe even offer to wave the first years maintenance fee 
for legacy resources when they sign a LRSA and are conducting other 
business with ARIN at the same time.

I don't support a requirement to sign the LRSA, at least at this time, 
maybe someday.  However, I see nothing wrong with some strong up selling 
by ARIN, "Would You Like Fries with That". :)
