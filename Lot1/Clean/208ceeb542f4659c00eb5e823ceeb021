Have you attempted a learn-in? If it does that at least you know the Sony
will grab and read a cd directory. If you're not familiar with that do some
Googling for Sony CDK-006. I don't have my manual handy or I'd tell you how.

I have a Seeburg SCD-1A.  When I select an album and track number the
display shows it accepted but the Sony CDK-006 does not respond.  Any Ideas
on the problem?

Also, the battery light comes even though they are still good?

Any help would be great.
