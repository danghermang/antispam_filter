yes and this applies to everyone on the street also; all are potential 
muggers.... I think the main thing to think about is, is my traffic 
valuable? Would anyone actually want the information? Do I really care? 
I don't mind (that much) if someone on the bus overhears me saying soppy 
stuff to my girl friend and I don't really care if some hackerette in 
McD's wiresharks the e-mail equivilent, much good it'll do them.

Do you shred every letter, each piece of junk mail, before it goes it 
the recycling? Am I about to put a password on my home PC in case 
someone breaks in and posts nasty stuff to my facebook account?

Of course it is not a great idea to check your bank account in Starbucks 
or upload that *.pdf about the gzillion pound deal you're about to 
broker in Dubai, no more than to chuck your bank statements into the 
paper recycling box. And of course it is not great to leave yourself 
permanently logged in to google mail on that PC in the internet cafe you 
visited on holiday.

The care taken should be in proportion to the value of the data your 
dealing with. Presumably if your updating a website using ftp then the 
stuff that is uploaded will be content for the site. So it will be 
visable anyhow. Does it matter if someone gets to feel they are hacker 
of the month by attempting to read it as it flys past them in wireshark 
(or whatever), well good luck, get a life...

And at least with linux you can download as many dodgy e-mail 
attachments with hidden .exe files as you want, happy in the knowledge 
that nothing will happen.

The internet is really like talking on the bus. If someone is that 
interested they can probably hear you. If they're that interested they 
train a directional mic on you, and if the conversation is that 
important probably you should have it somewhere else, or the equivalent 
of a sound proof room with no windows (lip reading). And shouting out 
your PIN number etc is not a very inspired idea.

I suppose someone could read my fireftp uploads, get the password and 
turn it into a site selling viagra (if only I got so much traffic..)

proportionality, proportionality, proportionality....
