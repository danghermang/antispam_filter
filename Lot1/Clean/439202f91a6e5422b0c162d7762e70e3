Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] 6973 to el84 info needed.
Parts from mouser are ordered.  I just need to test my 12au7 tubes I picked=
 up in Chicago then I can order the output tubes. =20
  I did get the 100 ohm resistors I plan on doing that mod.  Just to clarif=
y I should disconnect the wires from the socket and put the resistor in ser=
ies.  Should I bother to tie 1 and 8 together while I am at it?
  And one last question.  Does anyone have the test data for the 6973 tube =
for the Jackson 648 tester?
Thanks
Ed Owens
