Subject:[Chelsea] Cheers !
With the 'Sloney Pony' being closed for refurbishment, I had pre-match
drinks at The Eight Bells close by Putney Bridge.  The journey from the pub
to the ground was much quicker than planned and we arrived with about 25
minutes to spare.

Went into Jimmy's Bar for something to drink, expecting coffee or
something... but they were actually selling alcohol so we tucked into some
bottles of London Pride.

When did they change the rules ?
