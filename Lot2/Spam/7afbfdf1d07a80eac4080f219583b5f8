and I don't have an update for you on that," an exasperated 
Carney said.By Tuesday morning, Obama and his aides concluded that they couldn't 
contain the matter any longer. They started putting a plan in motion 
for Obama to embrace gay marriage in a television interview, which is 
how they had always planned for him to break the news. North 
Carolina's vote for the ban that night added urgency, for Democrats outside 
the White House if not inside.Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and 
Democratic chairman, voiced that urgency before the expected victory of anti-gay-marriage forces 
in North Carolina came to pass. He said on TV Tuesday that

to define what an election is all about."A victory will be all 
about motivating the base to turn out. That is because the undecided 
vote in Wisconsin is so small; minds are made up and few 
are persuadable. The winning side is the one that gets the most

for a primary in 60 years. Though Walker was only up against 
a protest candidate on Tuesday, 626,538 Wisconsin Republicans cast a ballot to 
prevent a fluke. A spokesman for that party says that shows the 
state GOP has a better ground game than opponents on the left. 
Tate says Democrats will turn out when it means getting Walker out 
of office. "We are set up in great shape to with this, 
and on June 5 this is going to be a turnout fight, 
and I feel really good about our abilities to win," Tate said.	</b></span>
