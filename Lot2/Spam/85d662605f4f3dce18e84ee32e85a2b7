Dear BELINDA JOY READ,  

Why wait for your statement to be ready? You can view up to two years of transaction history 24/7 in NetBank, allowing you to check your up to date balances on a daily basis whenever you want. Your statement for  ********7217 is now available in NetBank.  

Also, make the most of your account by depositing your salary each week, fortnight or month. Give your employer your account number plus BSB and they should take care of the rest.
