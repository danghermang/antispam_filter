 Basically since we are working for the American government we cannot keep these funds, 
 since we are three in number that is involved in this deal, this means you will take
 30%, I and my partners will take 60%, while 10% will be kept aside for any expenses. 
 
 This business is confidential, and we plead that it should not be discussed with 
 anyone. There is no risk whatsoever involved as we left this fund in the Security 
 company without declaring it's contents for this period of time to make sure that the
 fund will be safe for transfer and investment. If you are interested I will send you 
 the full details, my job is to find a good partner that we can trust and will assist us.
 kindly send me an e-mail signifying your interest including your telephone/fax numbers 
 for quick communication and also your contact details. I assure you that this transaction
 is risk free and its success is 100% guaranteed, Please help us to help you. Reply me via 
 this email: ricky@zsk.name for security reasons. 
 
 Yours-in-service,
 Sgt. Ricky kemp
