Dear Friend,=20
=20
I am the exchange manager here in SGBB BANK OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO WEST =
AFRICA.=20
=20
I got your information through one of my friend. He assured me of your capa=
bility to champion this business opportunity.=20
=20
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $14.5M US dollars (fourt=
een Million five hundred thousand US dollars) in account that belongs to on=
e of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in Iran ear=
thquake that happend on the 25th DECEMBER 2003 .=20
=20
Since we got this information about his death, we have been expecting his n=
ext of kin to come over and claim this money because we can not release it =
unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or relation to the deceas=
ed as indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately i learn=
t that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at =
the earthquake leaving nobody behind for the claim.=20
=20
It is therefore upon this discovery that i in my department now decided to =
make this business proposal to release this money to you as the next of kin=
 or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since n=
obody is coming for it and i don't want this money to go into the bank trea=
sury as unclaimed bill.=20
=20
The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained un=
claimed after ten years,the money will be transfered into the bank treasury=
 as unclaimed fund.=20
=20
The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by =
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe can not stand as=
 next of kin to a foreigner.=20
I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in res=
pect to the provision of a foreign account, 5%will be set aside for expense=
s incured during the business and 55% would befor me and my family.=20
=20
There after i and my family will visit your country for disbursement accord=
ing to the percentages indicated.=20
=20
Therefore,to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,=
you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased=
 indicating your bank name, your bank account number,your private telephone=
 and your private e-mail address for easy and effective communication and l=
ocation where in the money will be remitted into.=20
=20
Upon receipt of your reply, i will send to you by e-mail the text of the ap=
plication.=20
=20
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is risk-free =
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangem=
ents have been made for the transfer.=20
I kindly advice you to contact me immediately by my above mentioned e-mail =
