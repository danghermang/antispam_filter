Subject:YOUR PAYMENT APPROVED. SORRY FOR LATE CONTACT
From the desk of: Bannick Martin

ATTN:Beneficiary

Following the protest of the United Nations, The World Bank and IMF, that all outstanding foreign debts especially next of kin,contract payments and online transfer should be released to the beneficiaries forthwith unconditionally from transactions with any Mortgage & Finance institutions in European and African countries. The International Community has approved the payment of $5,000,000.00 (Five Million United states Dollars) to you as the beneficiary and the fund is officially deposited with HSBC bank in London.


I hereby advice you to STOP any further communication with your associates in any of the European and African countries for they contributed 100% hindrances to the release of your funds. We wish to use this opportunity to notify you that your payment has been re-scheduled to be released to you through the HSBC bank London,United Kingdom. I hereby request that you notify us on a possible date that may be convenient for you to visit HSBC bank in London for your payment or you may request for a bank to bank online transfer should you have a genuine reason(s)not to be physically present here for your payment so, get in touch immediately for a possible date for the completion of your payment.
 
Regards,
Mr Bannick Martin
Barrister of the Queen's Counsel
