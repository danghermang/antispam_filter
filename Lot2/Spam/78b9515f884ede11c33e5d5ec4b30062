 Personal Trainer</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-family: 'courier new'=
, courier; font-size: medium;">Did you know that the vast majority of peopl=
e in this day and age have excess abdominal fat? The first thing that most =
people think of is that their extra abdominal fat is simply ugly, is coveri=
ng up their abs from being visible, and makes them self conscious about sho=
wing off their body.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-family: 'courier n=
ew', courier; font-size: medium;">However, what most people don't realize i=
s that excess abdominal fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a =
dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly demon=
strated that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess body fat th=
roughout your body, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess abdomi=
nal fat.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-family: 'courier new', courier=
; font-size: medium;">There are two types of fat that you have in your abdo=
minal area. The first type that covers up your abs from being visible is ca=
lled subcutaneous fat and lies directly beneath the skin and on top of the =
abdominal muscles.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-family: 'courier new=
', courier; font-size: medium;">The second type of fat that you have in you=
r abdominal area is called visceral fat, and that lies deeper in the abdome=
n beneath your muscle and surrounding your organs. Visceral fat also plays =
a role in giving certain men that "beer belly" appearance where their abdom=
en protrudes excessively but at the same time, also feels sort of hard if y=
ou push on it.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-family: 'courier new', c=
ourier; font-size: medium;">Both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in the a=
bdominal area are serious health risk factors, but science has shown that h=
aving excessive visceral fat is even more dangerous than subcutaneous fat. =
Both of them greatly increase the risk your risk of developing heart diseas=
e, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep apnea, various forms of can=
cer, and other degenerative diseases.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-f=
amily: 'courier new', courier; font-size: medium;">Part of the reason visce=
ral fat is particularly dangerous is that it apparently releases more infla=
mmatory molecules into your body on a consistent basis.</span></p>=0A<p><sp=
an style=3D"font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: medium;">If you=
 care about the quality of your life and your loved ones, reducing your abd=
ominal fat should be one of your TOP priorities! There's just no way around=
 it. Besides, a side-effect of finally getting rid of all of that excessive=
 ugly abdominal fat is that your stomach will flatten out, and if you lose =
enough stomach fat, you will be able to visibly see those sexy six pack abs=
 that everyone wants.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-family: 'courier =
new', courier; font-size: medium;">So what gets rid of extra abdominal fat?=
 Is there actually a <a href=3D"http://mc5.bigredcan.com/tl.php?p=3Dsl/sb/r=
s/15c6/rt/rs//http%3A%2F%2F52af8i46uuvmq9o6r4t4rxyvgi.hop.clickbank.net%2F"=
>REAL solution</a> beyond all of the gimmicks and hype that you see in ads =
and on commercials for "miracle" fat loss products?</span></p>=0A<p><span s=
tyle=3D"font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: medium;">The first =
thing you must understand is that there is absolutely NO quick fix solution=
. There are no pills or supplements of any sort that will help you lose you=
r abdominal fat faster. Also, none of the gimmicky ab rockers, rollers, or =
ab belts will help get rid of abdominal fat either. You can't spot reduce y=
our stomach fat by using any of these worthless contraptions. It simply doe=
sn't work that way.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-family: 'courier ne=
w', courier; font-size: medium;">The ONLY solution to consistently lose you=
r abdominal fat and keep it off for good is to combine a sound nutritious d=
iet full of unprocessed natural foods with a properly designed strategic ex=
ercise program that stimulates the necessary hormonal and metabolic respons=
e within your body. Both your food intake as well as your training program =
are important if you are to get this right.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"=
font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: medium;">I've actually even=
 seen a particular study that divided thousands of participants into a diet=
-only group and an exercise/diet group. While both groups in this study mad=
e good progress, the diet-only group lost significantly LESS abdominal fat =
than the diet &amp; exercise combined group.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D=
"font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: medium;">Now the important=
 thing to realize is that just any old exercise program will not necessaril=
y do the trick. The majority of people that attempt getting into a good exe=
rcise routine are NOT working out effectively enough to really stimulate th=
e loss of stubborn abdominal fat. I see this everyday at the gym.</span></p=
>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: mediu=
m;">Most people will do your typical boring ineffective cardio routines, th=
row in a little outdated body-part style weight training, and pump away wit=
h some crunches and side bends, and think that they are doing something use=
ful for reducing their abdominal fat. Then they become frustrated after wee=
ks or months of no results and wonder where they went wrong.</span></p>=0A<=
p><span style=3D"font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: medium;">W=
ell, the good news is that I've spent over a decade researching this topic,=
 analyzing the science, and applying it "in the trenches" with myself as we=
ll as thousands of my clients from all over the world to see what works to =
really stimulate abdominal fat loss.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-fa=
mily: 'courier new', courier; font-size: medium;">The entire solution... al=
l of the nutritional strategies, as well as training sequences, exercise co=
mbinations, and more have all been compiled in my <a href=3D"http://mc5.big=

s well as get a flatter more defined midsection.</span></p>=0A<p><span styl=

's really that simple.</span></p>=0A<p><span style=3D"font-family: 'courier=

ir fitness goals is that they have good intentions at first to adopt a new =
lifestyle, yet after a few weeks or months, they abandon their good intenti=
ons and slip right back into their old bad habits that gave them the excess=
