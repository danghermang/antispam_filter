Subject:I'm not married
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and generous. 
I always try to keep myself in a good shape.. 
It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, communicative and with various interests. 
I want to love and to be loved http://tovanuhe.metrohosting.info If you want to know me better
