            <p style="margin: 1em 0" align="right">December 2012</p>
            <p style="margin: 1em 0">Dear Friend,<br>
            <br>When God speaks, <b>His words are binding&mdash;they&rsquo;re like an unbreakable contract</b>. He always says exactly what He means, He never lies, and He never says, &ldquo;Whoops, I&rsquo;ve changed My mind.&rdquo; <br>
            <br>Hebrews 1:3 says, <i>&ldquo;Upholding all things by the word of his power,&rdquo; </i>and Psalm 89:34 says, <i>&ldquo;My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.&rdquo;</i><br>
            <br>This entire universe is being held together by the power of God&rsquo;s words. It was His word that created the earth and every living thing on it, and by His words, He created Adam and Eve. <b>He didn&rsquo;t make them or any part of this world with His hands; He spoke it all into existence. </b>Then, after creating all of this, He said,<br>
            <br><i>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</i> (Gen. 1:28)<br>
            <br>He gave absolute dominion to Adam and Eve. When He said &ldquo;I give you authority and dominion,&rdquo; <b>He took His power&mdash;His right to rule and control the earth&mdash;and gave it to physical human beings</b>. In a sense, He excluded Himself from ruling over the earth.<br>
            <br>I know that&rsquo;s a new wrinkle in some of your brains, but it&rsquo;s true, and it answers many questions concerning the sovereignty of God. In the series I&rsquo;m airing on the <i>Gospel Truth</i> this month, entitled <i>The Word Became Flesh</i>, I will teach more about God&rsquo;s sovereignty and what that means to you.<br>
            <br>In Psalm 15:4, the Bible says that a godly man will swear to his own hurt and change not. The word <i>godly</i> means like God. God will swear to His own hurt and change not. So, <b>when Adam and Eve disobeyed God, He did not violate His word to save man</b> from the terrible problems that would come from their decisions. Human beings were given this earth to do with as they saw fit. However, this did not catch God by surprise; He knew it was going to happen and already had a plan in place to reconcile man back unto Himself.<br>
            <br><i>For if by one man&rsquo;s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man&rsquo;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</i> (Rom. 5:17-19)<br>
            <br>In Revelation 13:8, it says, <i>&ldquo;And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of <u>the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world</u>&rdquo; </i>(underline mine).<br>
            <br>These scriptures answer two very important questions: One, why did Jesus have to come to earth, and two, if it was necessary for Him to come, why did God wait 4,000 years to get Him here?<br>
            <br>It was a man&mdash;a physical human being&mdash;who had been given authority on the earth by God. When man allowed himself to be deceived and when he yielded his power to Satan, he became, in a sense, joint-heirs with the devil. Satan has to work through a human being. Man, through his physical body, gave Satan authority on this earth. <br>
            <br>Therefore, it was necessary for a man with a physical body to take back that authority. <b>God had to become man, to give Him the authority to execute judgment on the earth. </b><i>&ldquo;And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man&rdquo;</i> (John 5:27).<i> </i>God cannot break or change His word, so He was restricted to act within the word He had already spoken.<br>
            <br>But why did it take 4,000 years? Here is the logic: When God created the first man, <b><u>He said,</u></b> <i>&ldquo;Let us make man in our image&rdquo;</i> (Gen. 1:26). He literally spoke Adam&rsquo;s body into existence. At that time, He had the legal right to do that because He had not yet given authority over this earth to man. <br>
            <br>However, once He had given that authority to man, He could not leave him out of the equation. <b>The last Adam, Jesus, would still have to be spoken into existence by God, but He would have to speak through man.</b> God was no longer in direct control, and a man would have to become the voice of His words. Psalm 115:16 explains&mdash;<br>
            <br><i>The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord&rsquo;s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.</i><br>
            <br>That is a strong statement. In other words, everything outside of the earth belongs to God, but the earth He gave to the children of man. <b>God literally placed restrictions on Himself through His own words.</b> He had to work through people, and there were very few people sensitive enough to hear Him in their hearts and then prophesy what they heard.<br>
            <br>God had to create the new Adam through words spoken by someone with a physical body. Galatians 4:4 says, <i>&ldquo;But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son.&rdquo; </i>If you study that out, it means at the appropriate moment. Until then, all the prophetic utterances hadn&rsquo;t been spoken. Jesus could not come onto the scene until everything that had to be said was said.<br>
            <br>For example, it had to be prophesied that Jesus would be born of a virgin. That was critical because Jesus would not be just a good man&mdash;Jesus was God manifest in the flesh. Through Mary, Jesus received a physical body, but it was the blood of God the Father flowing through Him. He was a God-man.<br>
            <br><i>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. </i>(Luke 1:34-35)<br>
            <br>Here is what I believed happened. Mary asked, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this going to happen?&rdquo; She wasn&rsquo;t questioning the possibility; it was just the <i>how</i>. And the angel said that the word of God is the incorruptible seed: <b>&ldquo;All of the words spoken over 4,000 years, through hundreds of people, are going to conceive in you.&rdquo;</b> First Peter 1:23 says, <i>&ldquo;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.&rdquo;</i><br>
            <br>The Greek word for <i>&ldquo;seed&rdquo;</i> in this scripture is <i>spora</i>. It comes from the same root word as <i>sperma</i>, which is talking about the seed of a man. The virgin birth of Jesus was completely natural in every respect except one: It was not the seed of a man. The seed was the word of God. <b>The Word became flesh! </b>All that had been prophesied about Jesus became the <i>spora</i>, or the seed.<br>
            <br>Whether it&rsquo;s literal or symbolic, I believe that each of us have a spiritual womb. We take the supernatural words of God&mdash;the seed of the miracles we need&mdash;and we meditate on them until they conceive, until we can see the result in our hearts. Then, <b>when we can see it, we can speak it into existence</b>. This is what Jesus was talking about in Mark 11:23:<br>
            <br><i>For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.</i><br>
            <br>God&rsquo;s Word is living and alive. His Word is health unto all of your flesh and life to them that find it. He sent His Word to heal and deliver from destruction and more. <b>And for those who will place His words in their hearts and allow those seeds to conceive, they will in time see the manifestation of what they believe and speak.</b><br>

However, at a <i>Gospel Truth Seminar</i>, I taught a five-part series we have entitled <i>The Word Became Flesh</i>. Jamie and many members of my staff told me it was the best they had ever heard me teach on this subject. We created an album from that series, and it is available to you as a recorded-live DVD album. This teaching is also available as a CD album and as an As-Seen-on-TV DVD album.<br>

            <br>P.S.&nbsp; March 23, 1968, was the day that God changed my life forever. It was then that I really began planting the seed of His Word in my heart. It conceived, I began to speak, and now, forty-four years later, much of it can be seen by others.<br>
            <br>At this moment, a big part of what was conceived over the years is beginning to manifest. It&rsquo;s the new Charis Bible College campus at <i>The Sanctuary</i> in Woodland Park. Construction has begun, and you can follow the progress by going to our website: <b><a href="http://www.awmi.net/">www.awmi.net</a></b>.</p>
