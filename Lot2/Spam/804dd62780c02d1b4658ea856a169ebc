<P>Yes it's that time of year again. The Ironman of all Ironman races in Kona - the World Championships! On Saturday,&nbsp;11 October all eyes will be on the 1800 triathletes as they battle it out in the scorching heat in Hawaii. </P>
<P>As Race Director Diana Bertsch says, "If you are a triathlete, there is no bigger day in this sport than the Ford Ironman World Championship. It is the race that defined our sport as it came of age and continues to be the defining race in our sport for any avid triathlete."</P>
<P>If you are lucky enough to be on the starting line you would have either won your place in the lottery or qualified at one of the qualifying events held around the world - either way you are in for the time of your life!&nbsp;</P>
<P>You can log onto Ironman.com for live updates and track an athlete on Saturday,&nbsp;11 October 2008. Don't miss any of the action as the 2008 Ford World Ironman Champion is crowned.<BR><BR>To all the South African athletes making their way to Kona we wish you all the best.</P>

<P>To make the run course of the 2009 Spec-Savers Ironman 70.3 South Africa&nbsp;more spectator friendly, and to assist you the athletes, the course has been adjusted. We ask that you please familiarise yourself with this change to ensure that your race runs as smoothly as possible.</P>
<P>In short athletes will leave the Transition Area after the cycle and run down passed the Orient Theatre, be redirected along side the Finish Line shutte and out onto the Esplanade, continue along the Eastern Esplanade, up into John Bailie Road towards the Schenker Turn-Around Aids Station. Please note that you will no longer complete the Bunkers Hill loop. On your return, and before starting your second loop, you will once again run along side the Finish Line but this time you will move out onto the Pier before turning around and completing the second loop. </P>
<P>There are a total of&nbsp;three Aids Stations on the run (approximately 2km apart) and you will complete&nbsp;three loops before finally making your way to the Finish Line.</P>
<P>We trust that this change will allow you to be encouraged more by the spectators and improve your race. </P>

  <tr><td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="subarticlearea">
<P>The Paralympic Games in Beijing captured the attention of the entire nation. Everywhere you went you heard people commenting on the games. The games became part of our everyday conversations. Why did the games and the paralympic team have such an impact on us? There are many answers to this question. As a psychologist, I believe one of the answers is that the paralympic athletes symbolise what we in psychology refer to as resilience.</P>
<P><I>Resilience</I> is the phenomenon that describes an individual's capacity to maintain psychological and physical well-being in the face of adversity. Resilient people are optimistic, action-oriented people. If something goes wrong in their lives, they immediately start to think about how to make it better. Resilience does not protect you against adversity. It does, however, influence your response to adversity, and it is this resilient response to adversity that maintains psychological and physical well-being in the face of adversity. </P>

<P>Twenty-seven weeks to go and the FinishLine 2009 Team have been very busy, not only training but also working on the more intricate details of being an Ironman. </P>
<P>An information evening on the 28<SUP>th</SUP> August covered the important subject of nutrition. Coach, James Cunnama covered daily nutrition as well as training nutrition. Nutrition is often seen as the 4<SUP>th</SUP> discipline of Ironman. By the time that the FinishLine 2009 Team hear the gun go off on race day, they will know exactly how, when and where they have to feed their bodies for a perfect race.</P>
<P>Sunday the 31<SUP>st</SUP> August the FinishLine Team got together at the UPE grass track for a run clinic. IMSA Race Director, Paul Wolff and Elite Triathlete and Coach, James Cunnama started off with the importance of correct running form. A quick warm up and Paul then covered the importance of correct stretching. He then moved on to important running drills. The FinishLine Team then had to perform these drills under the supervision of Paul and James. To end the run clinic both Paul and James ran with each team member, analyzed their running style and showed them how to improve. The run clinic was a huge success and enormous fun. Triangle Institute has had several requests from Ironmen and runners for more clinics. Planning has started and dates will soon be decided on. </P>
