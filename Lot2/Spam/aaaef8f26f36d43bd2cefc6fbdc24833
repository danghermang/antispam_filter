Attention:

I am Mr Stephen King. I work with HSBC Bank, a  Global financial  
institution I am the Chief Economist of HSBC Bank. My colleagues and I  
are conducting a standard process investigation involving my client  
who shares the same Last name with you, and also the circumstances  
surrounding the domiciled estate made with our bank. Our client as the  
subject matter died intestate with his only daughter and nominated no  
next of kin to inherit this Funds valued at USD$ 18 Million Dollars.  
The essence of this communication with you is that you kindly assist  
me on three questions:

1-Are you aware of any relative/relation having the same surname,  
whose great grand parents emigrated from your country a long time ago?

2-Are you aware of any investment with HSBC Bank of substantial value  
made by such an individual with the same last name as yours?

3-Being the account/portfolio manager to the deceased would you be  
able to receive this funds contrary to the above questions if we  
legally present you to our bank, with our official capability,  
providing all legal backup documentations beyond all reasonable doubt,  
to assume status of a heir to the deceased as a relative, based on  
your same last name?

It is important that you inform me of your interest on this matter  
that we may come to an understanding as a team to put an end to this  
inquiry. Do reply your interest in this matter to my private email  
(st.king03@yahoo.com.hk) as i will be out of the office on an official  
matter for several days.

Mr Stephen King
