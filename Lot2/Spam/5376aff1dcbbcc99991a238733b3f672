=0A=0ARE: How to use your blog to recruit ...=0A=0ANot all that long ago in=
 our regularly=0Ascheduled "Inner Circle" no holds barred=0Aq and a session=
 we discussed the proper=0Ause of blogging to recruit and enhance=0Ayour ho=
me business. Make no mistake=0Ablogging is extremely powerful as a=0Abusine=
ss building tool "if" used=0Aproperly, here's how to do it =0Aright . . .=
=0A=0AOne of the biggest mistake I see people=0Amaking in their blogging ef=
forts is=0A"why" they use them. Most people tend to=0Athink of blogging as =
a primary traffic=0Ageneration strategy, and it can be, but=0Ait's not THE =
best use of a blog in our=0Atype of business.=0A=0AYou should think of blog=
 traffic more=0Alike icing on the cake. The primary and=0AMOST powerful use=
 of starting and using=0Aa blog in your business is it's ability=0Ato creat=
e a powerful testimonial for=0Ayou. Let me explain . . .=0A=0AWhen I starte=
d my first successful=0Abusiness here's exactly what I did. On=0Aan almost =
daily basis I blogged about=0Asomething relating to my business, at=0Athe t=
op of that blog I would always note=0Athe number of people in our team, and=
=0Athen carry on with the message.=0A=0ASometimes if I had new recruits I w=
ould=0Acreate a formal blog welcome to my new=0Ateam mates by listing their=
 names and=0Awelcoming them to the team.=0A=0AIf there was a co-op, adverti=
sing=0Astrategy that was working well for me,=0Ayou better bet I put in on =
that blog.=0A=0AWhy? Well, I haven't told you how I used=0Amy blog to recru=
it yet (we'll get to=0Athat in a second), but along with using=0Aa blog to =
recruit I also constantly=0Areferred my team members there for any=0Aand al=
l updates on our business.=0A=0AIt was a central meeting point. As a=0Aresu=
lt my team always checked the blog=0Ato see what was going on in our=0Abusi=
ness. This was important for two=0Areasons:=0A=0AFirst, easy access to impo=
rtant current=0Ainformation pertaining to our team, and=0Asecond as team wi=
de social proof.=0A=0AThey came to the blog and saw the number=0Aof people =
on the team growing and=0Awelcome messages to our new team members=0Aand su=
bconsciously it helped raise their=0Abelief level about the business they=
=0Awere in.=0A=0AIt's sometimes easy for a new recruit to=0Aget discouraged=
 without encouragement=0Aand the blog helped give them that=0Aencouragement=
 they needed. As a result=0Athey "believed" in the business, and=0Atook mor=
e proactive action to go out and=0Ado what we were doing to grow which=0Atr=
anslated into a higher rate of=0Aduplication in the business and longer=0Ar=
etention.=0A=0ASo let's recap so far, we've got a blog=0Awhere we're bloggi=
ng about our team,=0Awhat we're doing to advertise, we're=0A"training" our =
team members to check the=0Ablog often for advice and encouragement=0Aand a=
s a result their using that=0Amotivation to go out and build. This=0Acauses=
 the team to grow faster,=0Astronger, and better.=0A=0AWhat do we have? Tha=
t sounds like a=0Apretty darn powerful testimonial to me.=0AAnd that's the =
primary use of the blog=0Aas far as recruiting is concerned as I=0Amentione=
d earlier.=0A=0AThe mistake most people make is they=0Awant to blog for tra=
ffic, which you can=0Ado, and I'll share a few tips to doing=0Athat better =
in a few, but not it's best=0Ause for recruiting. Here's how to use=0Ayour =
blog to recruit . . .=0A=0AI'd generate leads directly to my own=0Alead cap=
ture page or my company's lead=0Acapture page. Once I saw my lead opt in=0A=
I would send them a personal email to=0Atell them a little bit about myself=
, our=0Ateam, and our business. In that email I=0Awould always include a li=
nk to my blog=0Aso my prospects could get an inside look=0Aat who I and our=
 team was doing.=0A=0AThis is powerful as heck for a couple=0Areasons where=
 recruiting is concerned.=0A=0AFirst, people are inherently=0Avoyeuristic. =
They wanna spy, so let=0Athem. By sending my prospects to my blog=0Athey no=
w had the opportunity to get to=0Aknow me and my team without me even=0Abei=
ng there. As a result, when we did=0Ahave an email correspondence or they=
=0Acalled me they already knew me.=0A=0AI've always found this to be a MUCH=
=0Abetter option than cold calling leads. I=0Alet them get to know me first=
.=0A=0ASecond reason this is powerful is based=0Aon a principle called "The=
 Power Of=0ADocumentation" which states we as humans=0Atend to take things =
which we read as=0Amore truthful than things we just hear.=0A=0AIn other wo=
rds, a prospect who goes to=0Ayour blog and reads about you and your=0Ateam=
 is going to take what they read=0Athere at face value where if you're on=
=0Athe phone telling them the same thing=0Athey're most likely saying "Yeah=
 right"=0A=0AIf you've ever called leads and had that=0Aquestion come up of=
 "Well why should I=0Ajoin you?" Having and sending your=0Aprospects to you=
r blog first will=0Avirtually eliminate this objection and=0Aignite powerfu=
l curiosity and intrigue=0Aabout you and what you do.=0A=0ASo, when it come=
s to using a blog to=0Arecruit, it's best us is as a secondary=0Atraffic st=
rategy. You get the lead, then=0Ayou send them to your blog for a=0Apowerfu=
l testimonial.=0A=0ASo I can hear the question welling up=0A"What should I =
put on my blog to start?"=0ASimple, talk about yourself, your=0Acompany's p=
roducts and service, why you=0Alove your company, your team, AND here's=0Aa=
 key . . .=0A=0AAsk your upline or downline to write you=0Aa quick note abo=
ut why it's great to=0Awork with you and put it on your blog.=0A=0AYou do t=
hat, and you've covered all your=0Abases. Not only are your prospects=0Alea=
rning about you, why you like what=0Ayou do, your personality, your team, B=
UT=0Athey're also SEEING other people saying=0Agreat things about you. Thir=
d party=0Avalidation about you is a powerful=0Athing.=0A=0ASimply doing thi=
s and nothing else, I=0Awas surprised to see that after about=0Asix months =
of consistent blogging my=0Ablog received about 300 site views per=0Aday fr=
om people finding online via=0Asearch engines. I did nothing but blog,=0Abu=
t just because I had content on the=0Ablog I had tons of people finding it =
for=0Afree, and as a result, calls out of the=0Ablue from people saying "ye=
ah I found=0Ayour blog, what's up with your business"=0A(kinda cool)=0A=0AS=
o let me share a few things you can do=0Ato improve you search engine ranki=
ngs=0Afor you blog posts to enhance your free=0Atraffic.=0A=0AFirst, do a l=
ittle keyword research=0Ausing the Google Keyword tool. Find a=0Afew keywor=
ds related to business and use=0Athose keywords in your blog title, and a=
=0Afew times, along with a few synonyms for=0Athat main keyword in your blo=
g post.=0A=0AOne secret strategy that's really=0Aincreased my blog traffic =
personally is=0Ausing images in my blog.=0A=0AOn blog posts where I insert =
an image to=0Acorrespond to the blog post keyword I=0Atend to get about dou=
ble the traffic. So=0Afind a few images related to your blog=0Apost keyword=
.=0A=0AName those images as your main keyword,=0Afor instance if my blog po=
st was based=0Aon the keyword "internet network=0Amarketing" then then I wo=
uld find 3=0Aimages I could use for that keyword and=0AI would name the ima=
ges:=0A=0Ainternet-network-marketing1.jpg,=0Ainternet-network-marketing2.jp=
g,=0Ainternet-network-marketing3.jpg =0Aetc.=0A=0ASearch engines rank you b=
ased on how=0Amany other websites link to your post=0Arelated to your keywo=
rds, so when you=0Acreate a new blog post, write an article=0Awith the same=
 keyword and submit it to=0Athe major article directories with a=0Alink goi=
ng back to your main blog post.=0A=0AFind a few other blogs in the niche an=
d=0Acomment on a few post and link back to=0Ayour blog post.=0A=0ACreate a =
facebook, twitter, myspace,=0Asquidoo account and post some content=0Abased=
 on the keyword and link those back=0Ato your blog post.=0A=0AYou do that f=
or you blog and you're=0Aahead of 99% of marketers.=0A=0ASo now that we've =
got traffic down,=0Alet's talk about $$$, how do you make=0Amoney with your=
 blog? I think the=0Asimplest way to make money with blog=0Afrom the outset=
 is to simply add Google=0AAdsense to each blog post, not so much=0Abecause=
 you'll make a ton of cash from=0Ait, but when people do click on your=0AGo=
ogle Adsense ads on your blog you'll=0Amake a few bucks which is powerful=
=0Apositive reinforcement for your efforts=0Ain the early going.=0A=0AIt'll=
 fuel you forward. You'll see money=0Acoming in and you'll get excited.=0A=
=0AThe best long term way to make money=0Awith your blog though is . . .=0A=
=0AIntegrating your blog with your email=0Amarketing efforts. I love using =
the one=0Atwo punch of email marketing and=0Ablogging because it allows you=
 to change=0Athe dynamic of your email messages to=0Ayour prospects from a =
one way=0Aconversation to a two way conversation=0Aby giving your prospects=
 the ability to=0Acomment back to you.=0A=0AGetting people involved and com=
menting=0Aon your blog is a powerful way to build=0Atrust. Think of your bl=
og as a=0Aconversation and you'll see the bond=0Abetween you and your prosp=
ects growing=0Astronger daily and for it your income=0Awill increase.=0A=0A=
There are two powerful benefits of=0Aturning your emails into a blog=0Aconv=
ersation.=0A=0AThe first is simply when people get=0Ainvolved and proactive=
ly comment they've=0Ataking a powerful step into your world.=0AThe second b=
enefit is a little more=0Asneaky, but extremely powerful.=0A=0ASay you send=
 a prospect to your blog to=0Ashare an important post today and 15=0Apeople=
 comment on that post. Great!=0A=0AWell what if you take the email that you=
=0Asent people to your blog and add it to=0Ayour auto responder?=0A=0ANow t=
he leads that join your list 3=0Amonths from now will get that email=0Aauto=
matically via your autoresponder=0Aemail sequence you set up and when they=
=0Aget to the post not only are they going=0Ato get to participate in a con=

that commented=0Aprior and say . . .=0A=0A"Wow! I just got this email and 1=

&amp;</a><br><br>RE: How to use your blog to recruit ...<br><br>Not all tha=
t long ago in our regularly<br>scheduled "Inner Circle" no holds barred<br>=
q and a session we discussed the proper<br>use of blogging to recruit and e=
nhance<br>your home business. Make no mistake<br>blogging is extremely powe=
rful as a<br>business building tool "if" used<br>properly, here's how to do=
 it <br>right . . .<br><br>One of the biggest mistake I see people<br>makin=
g in their blogging efforts is<br>"why" they use them. Most people tend to<=
br>think of blogging as a primary traffic<br>generation strategy, and it ca=
n be, but<br>it's not THE best use of a blog in our<br>type
 of business.<br><br>You should think of blog traffic more<br>like icing on=
 the cake. The primary and<br>MOST powerful use of starting and using<br>a =
blog in your business is it's ability<br>to create a powerful testimonial f=
or<br>you. Let me explain . . .<br><br>When I started my first successful<b=
r>business here's exactly what I did. On<br>an almost daily basis I blogged=
 about<br>something relating to my business, at<br>the top of that blog I w=
ould always note<br>the number of people in our team, and<br>then carry on =
with the message.<br><br>Sometimes if I had new recruits I would<br>create =
a formal blog welcome to my new<br>team mates by listing their names and<br=
>welcoming them to the team.<br><br>If there was a co-op, advertising<br>st=
rategy that was working well for me,<br>you better bet I put in on that blo=
g.<br><br>Why? Well, I haven't told you how I used<br>my blog to recruit ye=
t (we'll get to<br>that in a second), but along with using<br>a blog
 to recruit I also constantly<br>referred my team members there for any<br>=
and all updates on our business.<br><br>It was a central meeting point. As =
a<br>result my team always checked the blog<br>to see what was going on in =
our<br>business. This was important for two<br>reasons:<br><br>First, easy =
access to important current<br>information pertaining to our team, and<br>s=
econd as team wide social proof.<br><br>They came to the blog and saw the n=
umber<br>of people on the team growing and<br>welcome messages to our new t=
eam members<br>and subconsciously it helped raise their<br>belief level abo=
ut the business they<br>were in.<br><br>It's sometimes easy for a new recru=
it to<br>get discouraged without encouragement<br>and the blog helped give =
them that<br>encouragement they needed. As a result<br>they "believed" in t=
he business, and<br>took more proactive action to go out and<br>do what we =
were doing to grow which<br>translated into a higher rate
 of<br>duplication in the business and longer<br>retention.<br><br>So let's=
 recap so far, we've got a blog<br>where we're blogging about our team,<br>=
what we're doing to advertise, we're<br>"training" our team members to chec=
k the<br>blog often for advice and encouragement<br>and as a result their u=
sing that<br>motivation to go out and build. This<br>causes the team to gro=
w faster,<br>stronger, and better.<br><br>What do we have? That sounds like=
 a<br>pretty darn powerful testimonial to me.<br>And that's the primary use=
 of the blog<br>as far as recruiting is concerned as I<br>mentioned earlier=
.<br><br>The mistake most people make is they<br>want to blog for traffic, =
which you can<br>do, and I'll share a few tips to doing<br>that better in a=
 few, but not it's best<br>use for recruiting. Here's how to use<br>your bl=
og to recruit . . .<br><br>I'd generate leads directly to my own<br>lead ca=
pture page or my company's lead<br>capture page. Once I saw my lead
 opt in<br>I would send them a personal email to<br>tell them a little bit =
about myself, our<br>team, and our business. In that email I<br>would alway=
s include a link to my blog<br>so my prospects could get an inside look<br>=
at who I and our team was doing.<br><br>This is powerful as heck for a coup=
le<br>reasons where recruiting is concerned.<br><br>First, people are inher=
ently<br>voyeuristic. They wanna spy, so let<br>them. By sending my prospec=
ts to my blog<br>they now had the opportunity to get to<br>know me and my t=
eam without me even<br>being there. As a result, when we did<br>have an ema=
il correspondence or they<br>called me they already knew me.<br><br>I've al=
ways found this to be a MUCH<br>better option than cold calling leads. I<br=
>let them get to know me first.<br><br>Second reason this is powerful is ba=
sed<br>on a principle called "The Power Of<br>Documentation" which states w=
e as humans<br>tend to take things which we read as<br>more truthful
 than things we just hear.<br><br>In other words, a prospect who goes to<br=
>your blog and reads about you and your<br>team is going to take what they =
read<br>there at face value where if you're on<br>the phone telling them th=
e same thing<br>they're most likely saying "Yeah right"<br><br>If you've ev=
er called leads and had that<br>question come up of "Well why should I<br>j=
oin you?" Having and sending your<br>prospects to your blog first will<br>v=
irtually eliminate this objection and<br>ignite powerful curiosity and intr=
igue<br>about you and what you do.<br><br>So, when it comes to using a blog=
 to<br>recruit, it's best us is as a secondary<br>traffic strategy. You get=
 the lead, then<br>you send them to your blog for a<br>powerful testimonial=
.<br><br>So I can hear the question welling up<br>"What should I put on my =
blog to start?"<br>Simple, talk about yourself, your<br>company's products =
and service, why you<br>love your company, your team, AND
 here's<br>a key . . .<br><br>Ask your upline or downline to write you<br>a=
 quick note about why it's great to<br>work with you and put it on your blo=
g.<br><br>You do that, and you've covered all your<br>bases. Not only are y=
our prospects<br>learning about you, why you like what<br>you do, your pers=
onality, your team, BUT<br>they're also SEEING other people saying<br>great=
 things about you. Third party<br>validation about you is a powerful<br>thi=
ng.<br><br>Simply doing this and nothing else, I<br>was surprised to see th=
at after about<br>six months of consistent blogging my<br>blog received abo=
ut 300 site views per<br>day from people finding online via<br>search engin=
es. I did nothing but blog,<br>but just because I had content on the<br>blo=
g I had tons of people finding it for<br>free, and as a result, calls out o=
f the<br>blue from people saying "yeah I found<br>your blog, what's up with=
 your business"<br>(kinda cool)<br><br>So let me share a few things
 you can do<br>to improve you search engine rankings<br>for you blog posts =
to enhance your free<br>traffic.<br><br>First, do a little keyword research=
<br>using the Google Keyword tool. Find a<br>few keywords related to busine=
ss and use<br>those keywords in your blog title, and a<br>few times, along =
with a few synonyms for<br>that main keyword in your blog post.<br><br>One =
secret strategy that's really<br>increased my blog traffic personally is<br=
>using images in my blog.<br><br>On blog posts where I insert an image to<b=
r>correspond to the blog post keyword I<br>tend to get about double the tra=
ffic. So<br>find a few images related to your blog<br>post keyword.<br><br>=
Name those images as your main keyword,<br>for instance if my blog post was=
 based<br>on the keyword "internet network<br>marketing" then then I would =
find 3<br>images I could use for that keyword and<br>I would name the
 images:<br><br>internet-network-marketing1.jpg,<br>internet-network-market=
ing2.jpg,<br>internet-network-marketing3.jpg <br>etc.<br><br>Search engines=
 rank you based on how<br>many other websites link to your post<br>related =
to your keywords, so when you<br>create a new blog post, write an article<b=
r>with the same keyword and submit it to<br>the major article directories w=
ith a<br>link going back to your main blog post.<br><br>Find a few other bl=
ogs in the niche and<br>comment on a few post and link back to<br>your blog=
 post.<br><br>Create a facebook, twitter, myspace,<br>squidoo account and p=
ost some content<br>based on the keyword and link those back<br>to your blo=
g post.<br><br>You do that for you blog and you're<br>ahead of 99% of marke=
ters.<br><br>So now that we've got traffic down,<br>let's talk about $$$, h=
ow do you make<br>money with your blog? I think the<br>simplest way to make=
 money with blog<br>from the outset is to simply add
 Google<br>Adsense to each blog post, not so much<br>because you'll make a =
ton of cash from<br>it, but when people do click on your<br>Google Adsense =
ads on your blog you'll<br>make a few bucks which is powerful<br>positive r=
einforcement for your efforts<br>in the early going.<br><br>It'll fuel you =
forward. You'll see money<br>coming in and you'll get excited.<br><br>The b=
est long term way to make money<br>with your blog though is . . .<br><br>In=
tegrating your blog with your email<br>marketing efforts. I love using the =
one<br>two punch of email marketing and<br>blogging because it allows you t=
o change<br>the dynamic of your email messages to<br>your prospects from a =
one way<br>conversation to a two way conversation<br>by giving your prospec=
ts the ability to<br>comment back to you.<br><br>Getting people involved an=
d commenting<br>on your blog is a powerful way to build<br>trust. Think of =
your blog as a<br>conversation and you'll see the bond<br>between
 you and your prospects growing<br>stronger daily and for it your income<br=
>will increase.<br><br>There are two powerful benefits of<br>turning your e=
mails into a blog<br>conversation.<br><br>The first is simply when people g=
et<br>involved and proactively comment they've<br>taking a powerful step in=
to your world.<br>The second benefit is a little more<br>sneaky, but extrem=
ely powerful.<br><br>Say you send a prospect to your blog to<br>share an im=
portant post today and 15<br>people comment on that post. Great!<br><br>Wel=
l what if you take the email that you<br>sent people to your blog and add i=
t to<br>your auto responder?<br><br>Now the leads that join your list 3<br>=
months from now will get that email<br>automatically via your autoresponder=
<br>email sequence you set up and when they<br>get to the post not only are=
 they going<br>to get to participate in a conversation<br>you set up on aut=
opilot, but they'll<br>also see all the people that
 commented<br>prior and say . . .<br><br>"Wow! I just got this email and 15=
<br>people already comment there must be a<br>lot of people listening in." =
and hence<br>conclude you're a good teacher and<br>someone a LOT of people =
listen to.<br><br>So there's more I could go into on<br>blogging, but I thi=
