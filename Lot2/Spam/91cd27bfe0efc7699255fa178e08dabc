<FONT size=4 face="ArialMT">Following this year's (2012) review of the global financial matters and just concluded investigations today by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in conjunction with&nbsp; the ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CRIME COMMISSION (E.F.C.C), it is revealed that your email is among the list of people who have never received any of their payments among&nbsp; lottery, inheritance, compensation and awarded contract funds and victims who have lost a lot of money to scammers while trying to claim their funds.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=4 face="ArialMT">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=4 face="ArialMT">In view of the foregoing, a new payment of US$2.500,000.00 has been approved in your favor and credited into an ATM CARD which shall be delivered to you.</FONT></DIV>

<FONT size=4 face="ArialMT">Note: Thousands of fraudsters have been using this method in scamming most foreign creditors that we have in the payment list here in our office here in SOUTH AFRICA. We use this medium to&nbsp; inform you that any mail that do not come with the new communication code: SA/.CCUF -HFCR-/RLPHJ/.is false. In this case, you’re adviced not to respond to any mail that&nbsp; does not come with the above communication code for safety purpose.</FONT></DIV>

<FONT size=4 face="ArialMT">Our final conclusion was that, the fund should be paid to you via an Automated Teller Machine Card (ATM) as it seems, this will be easier and faster for you to receive&nbsp; payment.</FONT></DIV>
