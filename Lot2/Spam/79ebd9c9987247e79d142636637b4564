Hi Carl,
<br><br>
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) recently released the final rule that revises HOS regulatory requirements for commercial truck drivers. The genesis of revising the rule is safety. According to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the rule is meant to lower fatigue-related truck crashes and to save lives on the road. Drivers and companies must comply with the HOS final rule by 
July 1, 2013. 
<br><br>
HOS is one of the most heavily debated topics within the trucking industry because it will modify the time a driver is allowed to spend on duty, and because the weekly reset criteria will be time-variable. Companies and drivers are each accountable for following the new rules: the intent is that carriers encourage and require drivers to operate within the HOS limits. 
<br><br>
Since the rule was released in late December 2011, there have been many questions regarding what the new rule entails. <a href="http://www.optimizeourfleet.com/xata/index.cfm?p=CP14509701&m=21655&hp=1619&pg=1619&h=0&rd=1076" style="color:#00c8d2;">Click here for answers to frequently asked questions concerning the new HOS rules</a>.
