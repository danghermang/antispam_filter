Dear mr-jynx-vue-account,

You have recently requested to deactivate your deviantART account.
To do so, please visit the following link:

(If clicking the link doesn't work, try copying and pasting it into your

If this email was sent in error, someone may have gained access to your
account and it would probably be a good idea to reset your password.

Thanks,

deviantART
