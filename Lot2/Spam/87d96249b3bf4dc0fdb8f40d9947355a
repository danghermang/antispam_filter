Subject:Duh! Now I know why I like it...
Hey,

On Monday, I had my two lead developers over to my
place for our annual 4th of July party...

I can't get into everything we talked about while we 
were hanging out, but one thing jumped out at me... 

While I was sitting on the couch sketching out a few
development charts, one of the guys I invited in for
the meeting said... "Hey, that looks familiar".

And that's when it hit me... 

Now I know why Auto Pilot Income Machines made a lot
of sense to me... it's based on the same basic ideas
that I've been building a high-end, very high-dollar
system around.

So here I am, sketching out the basics of a system I
plan on selling... as it turns out, it's already for 
sale, and I've already been recommending it. 

Duh, right? Here's where you can check it out...

I wasn't exactly thrilled when I realized that I had
been working on something that was already done, but
that's why I have those kind of meetings... 

It wouldn't have made a lot of sense for me to build 
this kind of a system myself, when there's already a
killer solution on the market... 

It's not "exactly" how I'd do it, but it works... 

And let's face it, when you're working from home for
yourself... it pays to take shortcuts when they work
as well as this one does.
