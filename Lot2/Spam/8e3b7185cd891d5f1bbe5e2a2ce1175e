Subject:A husband
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very pretty and generous. I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, educated and very attentive. I want to love and to be loved http://sakosiwa.thport.com Let's start our acquaintance
