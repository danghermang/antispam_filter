Subject:My THAT ONE
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and generous. I enjoy long walks in a forest, sea-shore or just a park.... 
It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be ambitious, communicative and very attentive. I want to love and to be loved http://yipuqiya.prohosts.org If you want to know me better
