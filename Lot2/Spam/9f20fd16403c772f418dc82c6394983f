Hi
After his confrontation with the man in black at the end of Gunslinger,
Roland awakes to find three doors on the beach of Mid leading to New
York City but at three different moments in time. Through these doors,
Roland must draw three figures crucial to his quest for the Dark Tower.
He finds Eddie Dean and Prisoner. He meets Odetta Holmes, the Lady of
Shadows, a young heiress who lost her lower legs in a subway accident
and gained a second personality that rages within her. And he encounters
Jack, Death, a pusher responsible for cruelties beyond imagining. Has
Roland found new companions to form the of his quest. Or has he
unleashed something else entirely While the evil might of the Dark Lord
swarms out to conquer all and Sam struggle deep into, seat of power. To
defeat the Dark Lord, the One Ring, ruler of all the accursed Rings of
Power, must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom.

Verify this number 

The compulsion of the Ring, he begins finally to despair. The next to
last novel in Kings seven volume magnum opus, Song of Susannah is at
once a book of revelation, a fascinating key to the unfolding mystery of
the Dark Tower, and a fast paced story of double barreled suspense. To
give birth to her chap mother Mia has usurped the body of Susannah Dean
and used the power of Black Thirteen to transport to New York City in
the summer. The city is strange to Susannah. And terrifying to the
daughter of none who shares her body and mind. Saving the Tower depends
not only on rescuing Susannah but also on securing the vacant lot Calvin
Tower owns before he loses it to the Sombre. Enlisting the aid of Minna
senders, the remaining Kate climbs to the Cave.

I hope you are not sleeping yet.

It falls to the boy, the billy bumbler, and the fallen priest to find
Susannah, who, in a struggle to cope with each other and with an alien
desire to mother whatever creature the two of them have carried to term.
Eddie and Roland, meanwhile, tumble into western Maine in the summer, a
world that should be idyllic but is not. For one thing, it is real, and
the bullets are flying. For another, it is inhabited by the author of a
novel called Salem Lot, a writer who turns out to be as shocked by them
as they are by him. These are the simple vectors of a story rich in
complexity and conflict. Its dual climaxes, one at the entrance to a
deadly dining establishment and the other appended to the pages of a
writers journal, will leave readers gasping for the sagas final volume.
