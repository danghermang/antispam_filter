Subject:none1234, why you need to know SEO
Hi none1234,

Conrad here from LearnWebDevelopment.com.

Tomorrow, December 12, 2012 at 1:00 p.m. CST,
we have a brand new live online training class
called, “How to Bring More Visitors to Your Sites
Using SEO.”

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization.

When you learn how to use SEO on your site and
your clients' sites, you’ll see several benefits:

1. You’ll rank higher in the search engines which
means more people will see your site.

2. You can add SEO to your services and charge
your clients more to rank in the search engines.

3. You can start side businesses and websites
optimized with SEO to bring in passive income.
(Passive income means it comes in whether you’re
working or not.)

So, as you can see, SEO is important knowledge -
whether you’re a web designer or internet
entrepreneur.

SEO can increase your income - whether you’re
working for yourself, clients, or a company.

Like always, this class and the recording is
included with The Successful Web Designer
membership.

Here’s what you’ll learn in this live class:

- What is SEO and why it is important.

- How modern search engines work.

- How to find and use keywords to improve SEO.

- How to find and use domain names to improve SEO.

- On-page factors that affect SEO.

- What you need to know about social marketing
vs SEO.

- and WordPress plug-ins to help you with SEO.

Also, you’ll get to ask your questions about SEO
and get live answers.
