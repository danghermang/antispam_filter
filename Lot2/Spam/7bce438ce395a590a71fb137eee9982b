Subject:A Business Deal {06/05/2011}
Dear Partner,

It is my interest to contact you in other to solicit your partnership to transfer Millions of Great British Pounds out of my bank. I am Mr. Benny Higgins, the Executive Auditor and Head of Computing Department here in my bank United Kingdom. And this money belong to my Deceased Customer ''Late ED Swingle'' who died in a plane crash on 14 Jan 2002 along with his entire Family leaving no will or any Beneficiary to the fund. Bear in mind that this transaction is 100% free from risk as you know that i can not involve my self if there is an atom of risk in it as it will terminate my appointment with my bank and jeopardise my precious carrier as a banker. Browse the website for more stories over his death:

I want to transfer this fund into your bank account in your Country if you can be very honest and Reliable to me instead of entirely forfeiting this fund. Our sharing ratio shall be 55:40:5, while 55% is for me and 40% will be yours, the remaining 5% will be for any expenses we may cover during the transfer process. I will be in your Country as soon as the fund hits your account for the sharing and I hope to invest my share in your Country. 

Remember, I can only work with you if you can keep this transaction to your self alone because i am still active with the bank and as it deemed in this kind of business being a deal. Let me have your mobile tell number and endeavour to call me via mine below as well as send your reply through my below private email for my receipt and security reasons: bennyprivatemail@gmail.com
