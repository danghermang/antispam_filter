Subject:Epic Games Forums - Account Password Vulnerability

** We apologize if you're getting this message twice.  We had a problem with our password reset script. **

Dear sjaak,

Our Epic Games web sites and forums were recently hacked.  After some downtime, they're back up and running now.

The hackers may have obtained the email addresses and encrypted passwords of forum users. Plaintext passwords weren't revealed, but it's possible that those passwords could be obtained by a brute-force attack on the encrypted passwords. Therefore, we have reset all passwords.  Your new password at the bottom of this message.

The Unreal Developer Network (UDN) hasn't been compromised.  Thankfully, none of our web sites ask for, or store, credit card information or other financial data. 

We're sorry for the inconvenience, and appreciate everyone's patience as we wrestle our servers back under control.

Tim Sweeney
