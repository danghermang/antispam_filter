Subject:Will you?
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very kind and generous. 
I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, educated and very attentive. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://vozumef.3rdpartyhosting.com Let's begin our acquaintance
