Subject:From Mr. mark Tunde


Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Mark Tunde, a fund manager with Zenith Financial Group, a  
contractor and an investor who a customer is named Mr. Alfred Perrot,  
made a deposit valued at us$25,500,000.00. Upon maturity, I sent a  
routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

After three months we discovered from his contract employers that the  
depositor had died. On further investigation, I found out that he died  
without making a will.

however, my proposal is to front you as the beneficiary to the  
deceased customer of our bank, if this transaction interests you  
kindly let me know so I can advice you on how we are going to execute  
this deal and the total sum of us$25,500,000.00 will be paid and  
transfer to you by our bank on our behalf.

I completely trust you to keep this proposition absolutely  
confidential and kindly forward your full names, contact address,  
telephone and fax numbers where I can reach you easily. I have  
suggested that we share the funds as follows 60% for me 40% for your  
effort , I look forward to your earliest response through my  
alternative email address below: (mrmarktunde@hosanna.net) For  
security reasons.


Best regards,

Mr. Mark Tunde.
