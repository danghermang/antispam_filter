Chronos SOHO Notes 9.3.1 | MacOSX | 25.5 MB

SOHO Notes is the premier digital note-taking application for your Mac. Use it to capture, organize, sync, and share all of your stuff including text notes, PDF's, images, voice recordings, videos, forms, and web archives.

See more with the ALL-NEW Widescreen View.
The new Widescreen View lets you see more about a note without opening the note. This view has been popularized by email clients because it allows you to browse through your emails without having to open each one. Now you can do the same thing with your notes.
