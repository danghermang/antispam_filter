Subject:This is quite correct
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very pretty and romantic. 
I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be positive, reliable and with various interests. 
I want to love and to be loved http://cogevula.digital-cn.ru If you want to know me better
