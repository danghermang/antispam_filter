Subject:Private note to you;Do read this!
Hello Friend,

   This may not be the best way to approach you,however i certainly can not=
 figure out a more direct and private means of reaching you at this time.I =
decided to contact you alone directly,reason be that i now have every cause=
 to be mindful of whom i deal with and can reliably trust considering real =
life issues i have encountered in recent times due to my present predicamen=
t.

   I have been diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer,it has defied all forms of =
medical treatment,I have only about a few months to live according to medic=
al experts.The reason i contacted you is that i want you to help me distrib=
ute my hard earned funds,amounting to about Fifty Eight Million Dollars($58=
,000,000 United States Dollars) to charities within your country since my c=
lose friends and relatives whom i have been dealing with has betrayed the t=
rust i have in them.

   I will set aside 20% for you and your family to cover for all the hassle=
s and commitment this task will bring your way.If you know you can engage y=
ourself in this humanitarian task then i will advise that you contact me vi=
a email to discuss what it entails.

Have a great day ahead.

Regards,
William Simon.
