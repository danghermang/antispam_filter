Dear Friend,

My name is Mr.Roberta Luxbacher,I'm a Singaporean and a seasoned Banker with Malaysia
HSBC Bank (Malaysia office), am as well an account officer to a deceased
customer of our bank, we lost this customer in the tsunami disaster on the 26th
December 2004 in Sumatra Indonesia. http://asc-india.org/lib/20041226-sumatra.htm
and his account of US$19.761 million with us have been unclaimed due to
unavailability of next of kin/relatives to claim his estate.

My late customer was awarded two different contracts with Shell Development
Company here before his untimely demise on 26th December 2004

In accordance with the escheat laws in Malaysia as a kingdom, the board of
directors of the bank met forth night ago and resolved to turn the estate of the
deceased over to Government having waited for too long without the deceased
relatives/next of kin surfacing property and if this is done, invariably, the
funds will end up to become Government property and it is as a result of this
that am moved to contact you considering the fact that you share almost the same
name with the deceased.

In view of this, I am seeking your cooperation and understanding to stand as the
deceased next of kin to enable us claim the inheritance before the period given
by the bank elapse. If you are interested and in agreement with me, get back to
me quickly and I will send to you all our bank contacts and the information you
may need to proceed without coming to Malaysia, and be rest assured that it is
risk free project and the proceedings will be shared 50% each once the fund are
repatriated into your account anywhere in the world.

Please reply mrrobertaluxbacher@yahoo.co.uk immediately with your information including
your telephone number for easy communication and oral discussion. I await your
prompt response immediately.

Best Regards.

Mr.Roberta Luxbacher
