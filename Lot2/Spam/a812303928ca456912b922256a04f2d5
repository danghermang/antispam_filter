Subject:So simple
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very beautiful and responsive. I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be ambitious, educated and with various interests. 
I want to love and to be loved http://xanirofa.hostserve.us Let's start our acquaintance
