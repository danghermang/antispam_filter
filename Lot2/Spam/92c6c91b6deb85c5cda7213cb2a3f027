Dear Beneficiary,</DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
After proper and several investigations and research at Western Union and Money Gram Office, we found your name in Western Union database amongst those that have sent money through Western Union and this proves that you have truly been swindled by those unscrupulous persons by sending money to them through Western Union/Money Gram in the course of getting one fund or the other that is not real. In this regard a meeting was held between the Board of Directors of The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) also with The Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS) alongside with the Ministry of Finance - UNITED KINGDOM and as a consequence of our investigations it was agreed that the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars (U.S.$150,000.00) should be transferred to you out of the funds that THE TREASURER OF THE UNITED STATES has set aside as for compensation payment</DIV>
