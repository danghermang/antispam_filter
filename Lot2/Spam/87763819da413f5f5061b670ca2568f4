Subject:I have found you by an accident...
Hello!
I found ur page on the dating site a few days ago and I gotta say that I was astonished... I don't know what it is but You got something that attracts everyone to you. I did not notice how I started to write to you.
I almost forgot, my name is Genie))
I travel a lot and I love it so much! I always wanna go somewhere and I think that I'll be this way until I found someone whom I'd really like for real. So anyway I like to get to know interesting people from all over the world...
So, could u tell me some more about yourself?))) What kind of man are you? What you like? Why would u like to write me back tomorrow???)))
Can't wait for your answer... Write me back when you get chance.
Keep in touch
