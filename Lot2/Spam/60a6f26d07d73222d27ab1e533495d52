>>>I always thought that it made sense to put the filter between the tank 
and pump, to protect the pump.   However, I was seriously schooled by John 
Christian that this is not the way to go.   Fuel pumps are designed to push 
fuel, NOT suck it.   Yes, they suck fuel from the tank, but that is almost 
incidental.   A fuel pump can push against the resistance of a fuel filter on 
the way to the carb, but it makes life difficult for them if they are trying 
to suck fuel through a filter.

So, the counterintuitive answer is that the filter goes between the pump 
and the carb/fuel injection.   If you look at any new car, you will see they 
are all plumbed that way too.
