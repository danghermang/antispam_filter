 My Name :Michael Jones.

I am the auditor and head of computing department of HSBC Bank in United
Kingdom and I was lucky to discover an account opened belonging to a
customer of my Branch after our third quarter auditing on 9th Sept 2010
.

I am totally shock to discover this account was DORMANT for so time ,
when I investigated deeply by contacting the assigned next of kin I also
found that the next of kin to this account was an Indonesia who lived in
London for over 63Yrs and nobody has operated on this account after the
death of the deceased .

I decided to use my position at HSBC to communicate with you so that we
can claim the funds and transferred to your country smoothly so that you
can start Investing the funds into your country and I will come down
after three(3) months to receive my share .The deceased account balance
sum USD90,000,000USD because the account is a USD account operated with
HSBC .

Please respond immediately if you are truly interested to work with me
on this deal and I will use my position and influence to effect the
legal approval and onward transfer of this fund into your account with
appropriate clearance from foreign payment department.

You will stand to get 40% while 60% will be for me.Kindly quote the
reference (acct) numbers above when responding to this mail.

I will fill you in with further details upon your reply.

Sincerely yours,
Michael Jones
