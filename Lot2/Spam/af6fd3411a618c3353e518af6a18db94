Dear Friend,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I am John Ekene, a solicitor, Wills and Probate here in Nigeria. This mail is written and intended to solicit your assistance to be presented as NEXT OF KIN to my Late Client. My Deceased Client Stephen Reinhart,(Lakewood, Ohio) He made a fixed Deposit of Funds valued at US$12.8 million with a finance and security company here in Nigeria.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Unfortunately lost his life abroad Egypt Air Flight 990, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31st,1999 (news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and left no clear beneficiary as Next of Kin except some vital documents related to the Deposit which is still with me. All efforts by me to trace his Next of Kin proved abortive because he did not state any name on the WILL which he make prior to his death.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
The Governing Body of the finance and security company has contacted me on this matter recently and I am yet to provide the Next of Kin to lay claims to the Funds. Under a clear and legitimate agreement with you, I shall seek your consent to be presented as the next of Kin so that my late client's fund will not be confiscated by the finance and security company or by corrupt government officials. I propose a sharing formula of 60% for me, 40% for you and if you will agree to stand as the next of kin and have the funds deposited into any account that you will provide.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
