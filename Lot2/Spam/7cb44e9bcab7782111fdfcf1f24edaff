Subject:Only serious relationship
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very beautiful and romantic. 
I enjoy long walks in a forest, sea-shore or just a park.... It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, educated and with good sense of humor. 
I want to love and to be loved http://canakiwu.luservice.com Let's begin our acquaintance
