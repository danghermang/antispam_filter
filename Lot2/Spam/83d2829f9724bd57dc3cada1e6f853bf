Subject:I missed
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very nice and generous. I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, educated and with good sense of humor. 
I want to love and to be loved http://rumogex.eg.vg Let's start our acquaintance
