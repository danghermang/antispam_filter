Subject:My soul mate in the future
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very beautiful and romantic. I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. 
It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be ambitious, communicative and very attentive. 

I want to love and to be loved http://zayabito.yaraho.com If you want to know me better
