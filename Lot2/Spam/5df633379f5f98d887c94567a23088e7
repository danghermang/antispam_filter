huge amount of dollars($4.6m only) four milion six hundered dollar, in global finance trust scotland, united kingdom.
Though, according to my detained husband, he deposited the money in the bank's suspense account in favour of
his foreign beneficiary, he disclosed to me where he kept the documents(Lodgement documents) issued to him by
the bank and instructed me to seek for a life time investment abroad. I have succeeded in locating the bank and
confirmed the existence with most honest and confidentiality .Now I am soliciting for your assistance to help me transfer
this money out from Thailand to your account abroad so that we should invest it in any lucrative business in your country
