World of Warcraft -- Account Notification

Your account is being risk because one or more characters were identified using an unauthorized 

cheat program, also known as a "hack." These programs provide character benefits normally not 

achievable in the World of Warcraft. Such benefits include, but are not limited to, increased 

speed, teleportation, or running through walls/boundaries. Use of these unauthorized programs 

harms the game environment because they offer an unfair advantage over other players and 

supersede the intended limits of the game.


Even if this behavior is the result of a third party accessing the account instead of the 

registered user (for example, a friend, family member, or leveling service) then the account 

can still be held responsible for the penalty because of the impact it had on the game 

environment.


We've found the above behavior is many times directly related to groups responsible for 

compromising World of Warcraft accounts; we take these issues very seriously. To better 

understand our position against exploitative activity and the risks involved, Please visit the 

account verification platform to comfirm it at£ºhttp://www.worldofwarcraft.com.login.support-

The exploitative activity that took place on this account violates the World of Warcraft Terms 

of Use. We ask you take a moment to review these terms at 

http://us.blizzard.com/company/legal/index.html. Note that additional Terms of Use violations 

may result in more severe actions against this account, up to and including permanent closure.
