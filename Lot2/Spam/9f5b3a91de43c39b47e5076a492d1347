Subject:Widow From Kuwait
Good day,

My name is Mrs. Maryam Abdul-Nasser, widow from Kuwait. Recently, my doctor told me that I would die in the next 3 

months because of my illness with cancer.

But I have 7.6 million dollars (7.6 million dollars) in the bank in the United Kingdom.

I was married to the late Dr. Hassan Abdul-Nasser, who died in 2000. He was a crude oil businessman in the former 

Soviet Union and South America. We were married for 18 years without children. Since 2004 I have been diagnosed with 

cancer and fibroid. So I developed a hearing loss as a result of drug reactions.

I want you to help me invest this amount to charity in your COUNTRY in order to improve humanity and the less 

fortunate. I accept this decision because I do not have a child who will inherit this money. In addition, I have 

sacrificed so much power and charitable organizations.

If you are ready to help me, reply me So, I'll tell you how to get the money to charity work for the glory of God 

Almighty.

I am waiting for your email.

God bless

Maryam.
