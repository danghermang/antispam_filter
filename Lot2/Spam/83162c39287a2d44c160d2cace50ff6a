Subject:Giving Back, And Helping You Succeed... 
Hey,

It's not often that the truly successful people
in our field "give back" to everyone who helped
get them there... 

But when someone does, you should pay attention 
and really take notice, for example... 

Tom Bell is one of those people... after having
been a drug-addict, and literally homeless, and
eating out of dumpsters, he's turned his entire 
life around. 

Tom is a legitimate self-made millionaire...

And, to help give more people a chance to build
their own dream lives... he's doing something I
didn't think I'd ever see anyone do.

Tom is putting his team to work for you, and is
going to set you up with your own websites, all
done for you... and better yet, each website is
setup to have at least 30 streams of income all
pointing back to you!

He calls it his "Give Back To The People" event
and he does it once a year...  

I'm not sure how much longer Tom can keep doing
this, but I wouldn't expect it to be around for
too much longer...

Thanks & Good Luck,
Gary Ambrose
