Ref: Unclaimed funds to beneficiaries

We are legally empowered to track and release unclaimed funds to beneficiaries
and after a research , we have traced a dormant  account with substantial
amount of money on it now tagged “unclaimed funds” which by good legal work
can be transferred to your bank account if you can cooperate with me. 

Thank you for taking the time to contact me.

Waiting for your reply.
Yours Sincerely
Chris Warren-Smith
