Subject:Vivid dreams
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very beautiful and responsive. I enjoy simple things. I am very good at cooking and drawing.. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be ambitious, educated and with various interests. 

I want to love and to be loved http://cadoyeki.lhosting.info Let's start our acquaintance
