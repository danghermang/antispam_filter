Subject:please, stop asking. the answer is ...
Hey,

I know, I know ... 

You probably tried to grab your free copy of Butterfly 
Marketing 2.0 today ... but couldn't. 

The website went down in a ball of flames, just as I'd
predicted it probably would. You waited for hours, and
hours, and hours ... and it still wasn't up. 

Well, I have some good news ... 

Two things. 

First up, Butterfly Marketing 2.0 is FINALLY available
for real ... the site has been up and running smoothly
for a few hours now. And you can pick it up here ...

I would have told you sooner, but I really didn't want
to send you anything until I was 100% positive that it
was really working this time ... 

Now for the second part ... 

The bonus package I put together has been getting just
the kind of response I expected it would ... 

That'd be good. ;)

But, there's something you need to know. 

Before I get any more email about this, I need to make
something crystal clear ... 

I can not contact Mike and ask him to credit your sale
to me just so you can get my bonus ... so, please stop
asking me.  

I made it very clear that you should take a close look
at all the bonuses being offered, BEFORE you made your
decision who to grab your copy from ... 

Look, I know there were some "issues" with the site in
the first couple of hours, and, I can understand being
a little nervous about whether you were going to get a
copy of the course ...

All that being said, I'm sorry ... 

I won't ask Mike to move your sale to my account. It's
just not fair to the affiliate who is currently set as
your referrer ... 

I'd feel like I was stealing. 

But, if you haven't grabbed a copy yet, you might want
to take a look at the bonus I'm offering ... 

It's pretty darn good. ;)

Finally, Mike said that he was going to leave the site
up until Thursday to make up for the disaster when the
thing went live ... or, was supposed to go live.

But, I'm not exactly sure what "Thursday" means ...

That might mean he's closing it down at 12:01am, or it
may mean he's leaving it open until the last second of
the day ... 

Honestly, I don't know ... all I do know is that it is
still available now, the site is accepting orders, and 
I've got a killer bonus. 

You know what to do ...

Thanks & Good Luck,
Gary Ambrose

P.S. Even if you don't think you're interested, take a 
quick look at the bonus I've put together ... it might
just change your mind.

Yes, the bonus is that good ...
