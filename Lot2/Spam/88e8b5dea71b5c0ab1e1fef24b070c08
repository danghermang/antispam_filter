Subject:Re[1]:  WHERE ARE THE GOOD GUYS?
Hello, Kristian

I am writing you this letter, and don't recognize myself. As usual I didn't get used to make the first step. But everything is different today. I want to make the first step and to get acquainted with you, because I have never met such interesting people like you. You attract me with your beauty, your firm character. You may wonder how I know about your beauty, your character? It is very simple, I believe  my heart and it always says to me truth. 
If your heart began beating faster, after reading my letter, don't be slow, and write me a letter to http://andiloveyoutoo.com/hope


Kisses
