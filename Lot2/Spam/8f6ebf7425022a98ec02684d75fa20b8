Subject:So in love
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very pretty and responsive. 
I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, educated and with good sense of humor. I want to love and to be loved http://lpswadg.5ballov.ru If you want to know me better
