Subject:Do not rush
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very beautiful and responsive. 

I am keen on sports. Sports play a very significant role in my life, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, educated and with various interests. 

I want to love and to be loved http://zayabito.yaraho.com If you want to know me better
