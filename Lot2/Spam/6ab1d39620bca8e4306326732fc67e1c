Greeting,
      I am Timothy Harry; I work with One on One Tracking ltd, a consulting Firm in London, UK. We are conducting a standard investigation involving a client who shares the same name with you. 

The HSBC Private Banking client died intestate and nominated no next of kin to inherit the title over the investments. The essence of this communication is to request that you provide us information on these issues:

1-Are you aware of any relative/relation having the same surname, whose last known contact address was Madrid, Spain?

2-Are you aware of any investment of considerable value made by such a person at the HSBC Bank Plc.?

3-Can you establish beyond reasonable doubt your eligibility to assume status of next of kin to the deceased?

You must appreciate that we are constrained from providing you with more detailed information at this point. 

Please respond to my private email ( tthharry@aol.com ) as soon as possible to afford us the opportunity to close this investigation.

Thank you for accommodating our enquiry.

Yours sincerely,
Timothy Harry
One on One Tracking ltd.
