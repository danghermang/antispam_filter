<p id="mid" style="color:white; font-size:8px; border:none;">However, they are doing all of this outside of your body. They take some cells from you, grow them, infect them, and then give them back to you. I can't speak as to how they deal with the virus, but I doubt patients ever have free viruses floating about their system. Perhaps they mix in only enough virus to infect a portion of the cells, so all the virus has infected a cell before they give it back to you. I don't really know, but the point is, I doubt you ever have any free virus floating around - even though it wouldn't actually be dangerous.
Now, as for what this reprogrammed AIDS virus is actually telling these cells to do... basically in leukemia a particular type of cell is cancerous. So, now the cells are being programmed to attack that type of cell (cancerous or otherwise, so it isn't super specific), instead of making more AIDS virus.
Viruses do a lot of cool stuff, which means they can be pretty scary in their native forms. Fortunately, we understand not only how they replicate, but how we can harness that process for our own uses. I really do think they are the future of medicine, we just need to be a little less categorically scared of them.
TL;DR: Don't be scared of cuddly AIDS. Also go see NFB42's response.</p>

Crazy Kramer is back! 
Controversial ?Seinfeld? actor Michael Richards has been cast in a new sitcom on TV Land, the network announced yesterday.
Richards, 63, nearly dropped out of sight after Nov. 17, 2006, when he inexplicably launched a racist diatribe at the Laugh Factory in LA.
Now, he?ll back in front of the camera, shooting TV Land?s ?Giant Baby,? alongside Kirstie Alley and Rhea Perlman. The pilot will be shot next week, the network said, and Richards will play a limo driver in the show. 
The role could become Richards? first steady gig since he played Cosmo Kramer ? the ?hipster doofus? who lived across the hall from Jerry Seinfeld ? in the iconic NBC sitcom, whose nine-season run ended in 1998.

e of the main cast members from the hit NBC comedy "Seinfeld" will join veterans of another NBC hit, ?Cheers,? in a new pilot, Deadline.com reports.

For Michael Richards, who played Kramer on ?Seinfeld,? the role marks what would be his first regular TV gig in more than a decade, the story reports.

Richards will co-star with Kirstie Alley and Rhea Perlman of "Cheers" in the TV Land pilot "Giant Baby," the story notes. Gilles Marini is also joining the pilot in a guest star role, with the potential to become a recurring cast member.

The project is about Madison "Maddie" Banks, played by Alley, a Broadway star whose life is changed when her long-lost son returns to reconnect with her. Richards will play Maddie's limo driver and Marini will portray her chef. Perlman will be her best friend and assistant.

"The castings of Richards, Alley and Perlman are part of TV Land?s strategy to bring to its original shows some of the biggest sitcom stars of the past couple of decades," the piece points out.
