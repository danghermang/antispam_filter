Subject:NoOOoooooOOoOoooOoOooooooooo... Why would he do this!?!
Hey,

Let me ask you something... 

If you knew of a system that was making people up
to 500k per week... would you share it? 

I sure as hell wouldn't, and for the past 2 years
I haven't... but, that system does exist.

That's why I was mad as anything when I heard the
news. Someone else figured it out, but worse... 

They're publicly teaching it!

Now look, if it was up to me, this would still be
our little secret... but, it's not up to me. 

I thought long and hard before sending this email 
to you, and I probably won't send another... 

So look, no hype... 

If you want to know how a small group of us have 
been making anywhere from $20k - $500k a week on
complete, and total autopilot... you need to get
registered for this webinar.

And yes, I said no hype, and $20k - $500k a week
in the same sentence...

That's no joke.

I'm not going to try to convince you to believe 
me either... as far as I'm concerned, the fewer
people who know about this the better...

Thanks & Good Luck,
