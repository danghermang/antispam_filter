Subject:You're Single and I'm not married!
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very kind and generous. I like animals and I always try to help every living being.. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, educated and with various interests. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://lusohule.fhosts.info If you want to know me better
