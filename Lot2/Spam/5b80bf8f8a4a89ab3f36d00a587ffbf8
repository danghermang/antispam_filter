Subject:I never done before
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very kind and generous. 

I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. 
It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be positive, communicative and very attentive. 
I want to love and to be loved http://xadopalu.worthlessorwonderful.com Let's begin our acquaintance
