Subject:My darling, answer
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very nice and romantic. I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be positive, educated and with various interests. 

I want to love and to be loved http://cuvagag.aussie-hosting.info Let's begin our acquaintance
