Subject:You believe in love
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very nice and generous. 
I fond of outdoor sports special cycling and skiing.. It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be positive, reliable and very attentive. 

I want to love and to be loved http://vavuqifa.botetr.com If you want to know me better
