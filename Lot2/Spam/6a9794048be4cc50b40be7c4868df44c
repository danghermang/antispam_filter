Subject:beware this cruel scam
Hello Niamh

You really need to know about this scam just in case it catches
you unawares. Especially as now it's appearing in a lot of paper 
publications and internet job sites.

A company by the name of "Top Star Mailshare" is aggressively 
promoting it's homeworker scheme this month and at first glance, 
all seems legit...

... "seems' legit is just about right as you should avoid their 
offer like the plague!

They ask for £30 and offer to send you a "membership card" and wait
for your 'clerical work' etc delivered to your door.

To quote just one unhappy client - Julie (and there are very very 
many unhappy clients)

" I sent my £30 back in April 2008 and got my membership card in 
May and have received no work or contact from them..."

I launched a further-reaching consumer investigation into 'Top Star
Mailshare' only last week and I'll let you know my findings when 
it's concluded. 

One thing's for sure - it won't make it onto my list of 
opportunities that do make money at:-

Best advice is don't touch "Top Star Mailshare" with a bargepole!

PS. At the moment I am also finishing off reviews on three new
businesses who are offering a work-at-home opportunity. Two of them 
are not looking very promising at all but one however seems to be 
really coming up with the goods. Will let you know what's what when 
I've compiled all of the facts.
