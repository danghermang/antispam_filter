Subject:I seriously
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very kind and responsive. 

I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. 
It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, communicative and with good sense of humor. 
I want to love and to be loved http://cejijizo.digital-cn.ru Let's begin our acquaintance
