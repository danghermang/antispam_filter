2. Weekly Advertising Tip

     Is Your Computer and Internet Security Up To Date?

      Copyright © AdMistress 2012

=====================================

Nowadays it is relatively easy to start a new business
opportunity with a computer, an internet connection and a
small budget. Many people start their online ventures with
nothing more than their computer perched on the kitchen
table. In this manner, budding entrepreneurs put all their
energy and talents into building a thriving concern.


There is, however, one area of their business which can
easily slip through the net, and that is to ensure the
protection of their operating systems, and data from data
hackers and online intruders. The often perceived belief
that small size internet businesses are safe from computer
hacking and other destructive activities carried out online
today, is far from the truth. These activities are
increasing alarmingly as the internet evolves through the
years.


In research carried out by AMI-Partners, it was found that
nearly 50 per cent of small and medium sized online
businesses, did not use any security protection, not even
anti-spyware, or anti-virus software, on their computers.


This is why it was discovered that the Mydoom worm virus
affected one out of three smaller online businesses,
compared with only one in six of the large online companies.
It is easy to see that small online businesses are therefore
far more susceptible to data theft and electronic vandalism.


As thieves become ever more sophisticated in their onslaught
into the security measures implemented by data managers,
smaller business owners must give their data and network
protection top priority. Without it entrepreneurs are on the
verge of having their business wiped out at a stroke.


Big businesses have the necessary funds available to recover
from disasters, whereas, with their smaller funding, an
attack on a smaller business can easily be catastrophic.


Software providers are always coming up with the latest
solutions which will guarantee safety for your computer
system. And internet security services provide guaranteed
protection against hackers for stored online data. The use
of high level encryption technology will also give hackers
a hard time intercepting data stored on your computer
system, or while transmitted between a network of computer
systems.


The answer is to explore what is available and suitable for
your business. Make sure that your security is maintained
at peak proficiency, and that way you will avoid a
disastrous event which could wipe out your small business at
a stroke.

   How to Stay Focused On Your Blog For The Long Haul

            Copyright @ BillVannot.com

===================

Like most people, you probably already know what a blog is.


And like most people, you probably don't get any traffic to
your blog, unless it's from family and friends.


When blogging first started out years ago, you could put
up a few posts with a little seo,, and get a flood of
visitors to your site.


Nowadays, the stakes have changed.


Blogging is no longer something new and unique.


It's a lot more competitive to get readers because there
are so many blogs out there.


The good news is that you can get plenty of traffic and
visitors if you stay focused on your blog, for the long
haul.


Most people give up too easily when they're first starting
out their blogs.


They still want to believe that they can just set up a blog
and watch droves of visitors come to it.


In reality, you now have to create unique content that
you've worked hard on.


You need to decide up front that you want your blog to be a
staple in your online business.


You've got to decide that you want to create the best
quality you can.


By sacrificing with some hard work in the short-term, you'll
quickly gain a lot of exposure in the long-term.


Eventually you'll have a lot of people coming to your blog,
because they'll be able to see the quality of information
that you're offering.


By doing it the right way at first, you'll create a business
instead of a get rich quick site.


You'll be able to form lasting relationships with your
customers that will eventually result in repeat business.


By working hard and doing the necessary things the right
way, your efforts will be rewarded.


Once people find a blog that has high quality content that
is used with your own personal voice, they'll be more likely
to stick around and read what you have to say.


P.S.


Imagine what it would be like to take an under-performing
blog & instantly transform it into a cash-spitting money
making machine... NOW YOU CAN!

traffic to your blog by using other people's blog traffic
