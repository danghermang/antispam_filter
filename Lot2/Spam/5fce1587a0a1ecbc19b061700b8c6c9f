Subject:My man, let's look?
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very beautiful and responsive. 
I enjoy long walks in a forest, sea-shore or just a park.... 
It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, educated and with various interests. 
And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://juherixe.eg.vg Let's start our acquaintance
