Attn; Sir/Ma,
 
HAND OVER OF FINANCE MINISTRY / PAYMENT TRANSFER DOUBLE ACCOUNT HITCH.
 
My name is Dr(Mrs)Ngozi Okonjo Iweala ,Finance Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. As you must be aware, elections were held in Nigeria and a new President Dr. Goodluck E.Jonathan was sworn in on May 29th 20011.
 
Consequently, I was re-called from the World Bank where i was serving as its Managing Director and appointed to replace the former Minister of Finance by the 22nd of June 2012.According to protocol i was reviewing past payment when your transfer payment file particularly caught my attention. Upon further scrutiny, I surprisingly discovered that an Amount was since approved by the last president for transfer in your favor, but your transfer was technically impossible because there were two conflicting receiving bank accounts accredited to you.
 
But for this complication, I would have this morning ordered your transfer amongst similar others from the carry over surplus Federal Consolidated Oil Revenue Reserve Account, Please revert back to me urgently to clarify which of the two conflicting bank accounts are your authentic coordinates, so that I can act accordingly to also consider your payment for an immediate transfer.
 
Kindly note that this measure has become imperative to ensure that your payment is not misdirected into a wrong hand, as I have discovered that the double conflicting bank account is indicative of attempt by certain fraudulent elements in government to siphon genuine payment transfers like yours. You can only count yourself lucky that they have not succeeded to divert your transfer before this handing over process.
 
I also want to use this opportunity to advise you to be careful of the fraudulent schemes that is being perpetrated by certain unscrupulous individuals who go about deceiving beneficiary's with a view to defrauding such gullible beneficiary's.Furthermore i would like to advise that your payment will now be made directly from via swift transfer into your account.
 
 Presented below are the said conflicting bank account details, please confirm which one is authentic and I will initiate a special process to actualize your transfer to the indicated account without any undue delays or bureaucratic bottlenecks:
