Subject:I don`t like doing
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very kind and generous. 

I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. 
It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, reliable and with good sense of humor. I want to love and to be loved http://sakosiwa.thport.com Let's start our acquaintance
