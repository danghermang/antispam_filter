Subject:Has PayPal Ever "Frozen" Your Account? (Mine Was)
Hey,
 
Have you ever had your PayPal account frozen,
limited, or just plain closed?
 
Everyone I know in Internet marketing has at
least one PayPal account frozen, limited, or
closed at some point... and, as it turns out
I know the guy who was responsible... 

Steven Rounds, who I met through a friend of
a friend, was the guy at PayPal who invented 
the software the limits, freezes, and closes 
people's accounts... 
 
So, really, at first I wanted to just wanted
to punch the guy in the throat... I mean, he
caused me all kinds of trouble, and has cost 
me a ton of money too... 
 
Turns out he did something very smart in his
time at PayPal.. and I'm glad I didn't punch
the guy. ;)
 
He decided to create some cool, new software
that doesn't keep people from their money...

... instead, it brings money to them.

I've had a close look at his program, and as
a guy with some programming skills myself, I 
think this guy is the real deal... 

He has the credentials, and from his time at
PayPal, he got to know what really works and
what doesn't... he had "insider" access. 

If you want software that brings money right
to you online... then you need to check this
out immediately.
