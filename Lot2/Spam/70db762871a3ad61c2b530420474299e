Dear, Sir/ Madam!!!</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
My Name is Mrs Marina Luda,</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I am a US citizen, 46 years Old, I reside here in New Braunfels Texas , My residential address is as follows. 108 Crockett Court . Apt 303, New Braunfels Texas , United States .</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I am one of those that took part in the Compensation Scam Funds&nbsp; in Nigeria years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $18,000usd while in the USA , trying to get my payment all to no avail.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
So I decided to travel down to Nigeria with all my Compensation Documents, and I was directed to meet Barrister David Morgan, who is a member of the COMPENSATION SCAM AWARD COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me and said whoever is contacting us through Emails are fake.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
He took me to the Paying Bank for the claims of my Compensation Payment; Right now I am the happiest woman on earth because I have received my Compensation Funds of $1,500,000.00.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Moreover, Barrister David Morgan showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments Due to the Scam and Internet Fraud and I saw your name as one of the Beneficiaries, and your Email address, that is why I decided to Email you to stop dealing with those people on the Internet, they are not with your Funds, they are only making money out of you, I will advise you to contact Barrister David Morgan.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
You have to contact him directly on this information below:</DIV>

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in any way with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.</DIV>
<DIV>

As soon as you contact him he will send you the Document which you are to Fill and send back to him which he will use in getting your Compensation Funds, and also you will have to send him the payment in order for him to obtain the Document from the Court of law there in Nigeria so that your fund can be Transfer to you without any delay just the way mine was being transfer to me.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Send him the following details if you know you are ready to get your Compensation Funds, as soon as he receive your information he will send to you the payment details for sending him the $150USD that is needed for him to get the document that is needed to make the transfer a successful one without any further payment.</DIV>
