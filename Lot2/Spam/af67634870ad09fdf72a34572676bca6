Subject:I am a teacher
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very pretty and generous. 

I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. 
It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be serious, educated and with various interests. 
I want to love and to be loved http://japiyev.hyderabadadda.in Let's begin our acquaintance
