Subject:In need of your assistance
Attn: 
 
My name is David Holcomb, I am a Bank Of America External Auditor; I was invited by the United Nation Financial Committee (UNFC) to Audit Helima Security Storage company in Baghdad (IRAQ). During my investigation I discovered that in 2004, two soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division deposited a box from an unknown Top Saddam Husseins aide with the company during the war. Both soldiers died in an acting service, since then no one has come forward for the box. This Box contains $13.2 million USD (Thirteen Million, Two Hundred Thousand United State Dollars).

Due to my position in the investigation, I have moved down this box to a Bank of America Affiliate Security Company in Switzerland because of the countries low financial restrictions, to be delivered to any designation of your choice and I did not declare the box content as I declared it be a family treasure kept for security reasons. As a UNFC Audit agent and been a staff of the Bank Of America I cannot lay Claim to this Box but I can instruct that the box be delivered to you by Diplomatic means as the original depositor/owner intended.
 
I will give you more details and what to do if you are interested in my proposal, I am ready to go 50/50 Sharing ratio with you on the receipt of your consent.
Anxiously anticipating your prompt and affirmative response through this email: exaudit@blumail.org
 
Yours sincerely, 
David Holcomb
External Auditor (UNFC)
