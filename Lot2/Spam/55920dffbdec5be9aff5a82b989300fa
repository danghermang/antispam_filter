Mom is still in the healing process. I think she is doing very well, she does a little laundry and showere herself now. She has also adjusted very well to the ostomy. She will begin a folfox cleanup in a couple of weeks to catch any floater cells. Her treatment will be: a 3 hour office infusion and leave with the pump for two days. She will do this every other week.
So far all is well...praise be to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who has blessed me with the strength to endure all things.Mom starts folfox next Tuesday. She had been doing really well until about a week ago She has been having issues with weekness. Dr gave her iv to get her rehydrated. Said she was severely dehydrated. Through all this she has a high heart rate, standing or lying down. Don't know what thats all about the ony med she takes is coumadine (blood thinner) anyone else experience issues with heart rate.

Thanks!ust curious, mom started taking oxycotin time release twice daily along with hydrocodone for breakthru pain during her radiation form the 1st of Nov until surgery on Jan 26th. Now during her hospital stay she was on a hydromorphine pump with percocet for breakthru pain. 
Then they sent her home with a 7 mg percocet scrip which she took until a week ago. At that time she stopped all pain meds. I told her I thought maybe she could be going thru withdrawl since she stopped all at once...what do yall think?

Her symptoms:
Chills, nausea, rapid heart rate, weekness, restless sleep, just plain ole give out!Sending mom home. Cardiologists said heart good and no clots. He took her of blood pressure meds and started her lastnight on something to lower heart rate. I called her at hospital at 6:30 this am, and she says, " Hey Vickiedee!, I'm just waiting to go home...got my hair fixed and make-up on! God Bless my moma...she makes me smile.


Thanks for prayers!Hey Vickie,

Love that you posted your Mom's pics...it took me a few minutes to realize I had to access them through your profile. She looks wonderful. Take care of her! So glad to hear she is going home.

Cheers
DulcimerGalMom asked me this afternoon to call my sister so we could go 4 wheeling in her jeep! Thats just what we did. Her last words to me before I left today, "It's been a fun day". When you can say those words while having cancer, recovering from surgery, going through chemo and having to move a tearoom business, truly says how Great God Is! 
Mom went for second folfox treatment Wed. which she could not get due to very low red/white count. Took her to ER yesterday eve with a 101 fever. They ran tests last night and started her on antibiotics. Keeping her for the night. We will see what they do this am. Here we go again!
