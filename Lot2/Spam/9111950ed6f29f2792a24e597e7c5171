Hi Glenn

Spoke to Chris (the Endeavour II) this morning and he confirms that the =
tug boats are too high to be considered the POS so it is an aerial =
service main that is to be moved.
Are you able to help out with this?
Proposing that Alex and I get the new POA facia bracket set up, run the =
CMain and new underground sub main extensions in preparation, then shift =
the MSB when you arrive. Friday 14th or Monday/Tuesday 17/18th are =
windows for me =E2=80=93 how are you placed, should only take an hour or =
so of your time (plus the paperwork)?

Regards

Warren

Hi Glenn

Alex Bergmann gave me your email regarding a job we have on in Little =
Hartley next week.
Customer has a condemned private pole which is fed from a 11kV/400V pole =
transformer which is also on his rural property.

The tranny pole has an HV arm at the top an LV arm with tug-boat HRC =
fuses below this and then the Tranny below both.
The aerial going between the LV arm and the private pole is 4 core 25 mm =
ABC.
I=E2=80=99m looking to move this about 30 degrees horizontally and =
attaching it to a nearby shed thus decommissioning the private pole. My =
understanding is that this aerial would be treated as consumers main and =
the POS would be the tug-boats. However I only have level 2 cat 1&4 =
certification so I can=E2=80=99t move this if it is considered to be an =
aerial service main. I also can=E2=80=99t work above the tranny and =
touch the tug-boats, so I=E2=80=99d have to work live from the other end =
=E2=80=93 it has standard house connects so this isn=E2=80=99t an issue =
provided the ABC insulation looks OK.
I=E2=80=99ve been unsuccessful in getting through to Chris McGraw to see =
what he says but will try him again next week. Just flagging that I may =
require assistance for an hour or so next Friday if it is deemed to be =
out of my AUP authorisation. Not sure of your willingness or =
availability.

I=E2=80=99ve also left you a note in the MSB for the Mt Victoria job =
that I am supervising Alex to do. I=E2=80=99ve installed the meter but =
will need to come back to test =E2=80=93 the service fuses have had the =
HRC=E2=80=99s removed so it=E2=80=99s safe to energise the consumers =
main after polarity checking. I gather you will be on-site on Monday and =
if so could you give me a call (0415594664) and I=E2=80=99ll come up to =
meet you and do the final testing. I=E2=80=99m about 20 minutes drive =
from the site.

Regards

Warren
