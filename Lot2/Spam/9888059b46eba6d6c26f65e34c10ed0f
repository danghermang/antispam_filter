Attn: Sir/Madam
 
Before I proceed, I must first apologize for this unsolicited mail to you. I am aware that this is certainly not a conventional way of approach to establish a relationship of trust, but you will realize the need for my action. My name is Barr. Victor Robinson.
I got your contact information through public records while searching for a reliable person to work with based on my late client Eng. Johannes Brown, an expatriate engineer who worked with the Mining and Smelting Company for ninteen years.  
 
Before his death, he deposited the sum of $8.752M (EIGHT MILLION AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY-TWO THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS ONLY) with a security company here in Britain, but he did not disclosed the content of deposited diplomatic consignment to the security company, for security reasons. The security company has mandated me to present any family heir/inheritor for claim before the consignment gets confiscated or reverts to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, as an unclaimed diplomatic immunity.  

So I decided to search for any of my late client's relative which has been very difficult for me, as he did not declare any other person, address, partner or relatives in the official paper works of his diplomatic consignment deposit.
 
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Johannes Brown, so that the diplomatic consignment will be released to you. With my position as his lawyer, I will now place your name as the next of kin to my late client. I will prepare every relevant document that will assist your claims, and facilitate the release of the consignment.
 
Once the consignment is released to you, we shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 50% for you as your benefit. 


Please be kind to get back to me if you are not interested so that I can further my search for another partner.
 
Best Regards

Victor Robinson
