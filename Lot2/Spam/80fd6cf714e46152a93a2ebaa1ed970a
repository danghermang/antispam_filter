Dear Sir/Madam</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
We believe this notification meets you in a very good state of mind and health. The FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (FBI) Washington, D.C United States of America in conjunction with some other relevant Investigative Agencies world wide have recently been informed through our Global intelligence monitoring network that you have a pending FUND ($5.5million USD) transaction with the CBN regarding to a Contract/Next of Kin Inheritance fund payment which was fully endorsed to be paid in your favor. </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
It might interest you to know that we have taken out time in screening through this whole transaction as stipulated on our protocol of operation and have finally confirmed that the department of Dr.Dele Morris of Standard Chartered Bank Plc is the only authorized financial institution scheduled to make your payment in line with their remittance requirements.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Our African attache agent recently had a meeting with the Manager of Dr.Dele Morris of Standard Chartered Bank Plc along with some other top officials of CBN regarding your case and they made us to understand that your file has been approved and funds ready to remit. They intimated us that the only problem they are facing right now is that you don't have the deduction certificate, which will enable them to deduct all charges from your fund and pay the balance to you. This deduction certificate was what we all agreed upon, to enable them release your fund to you, without asking you to pay for cost of transfer or for any other transfer documents, and you must contact them now, and ask them how you can procure the deduction certificate, to enable them transfer your funds to you, without any further demand of certificate.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Sometimes, we do wonder if you are really, really with your senses. How Could you</DIV>
<DIV>
keep trusting people and at the end you will loose your hard Earned money, or</DIV>
<DIV>
are you being deceived by their big names? They Impersonate on many offices,</DIV>
<DIV>
claiming to be Governors, Directors/Chairmen of one Office or the other. Their</DIV>
<DIV>
game plan is only just to extort your hard Earned money. Now, the question is</DIV>
<DIV>
how long you will continue to be Deceived? Sometimes, they will issue you fake</DIV>
<DIV>
check, introduce you to fake Diplomatic delivery, un-existing on-line banking</DIV>
<DIV>
and they will also fake wire transfer of Your fund with Payment Stop Order&nbsp; and</DIV>
<DIV>
even send you fake atm cards etc.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
It is basically one of the main reasons why we intervene into this issue following series of report we have received from other beneficiaries to enable us assist them in carrying out proper investigation and subsequently informing them of their mandate to Remitting your funds. Most importantly we advise that you proceed with the dealings of your claims through Standard Chartered Bank Plc and you are advised to immediately contact them by asking them how you can procure the deduction certificate, which is the key to your funds release.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Ensure that you comply to all the Union Bank Plc procedures and also furnish the bank with their demands to enable them release your funds to your bank account without any problems, and dont fail to contact me with all your correspondence with them so we shall advise you on what to do to avoid any further extortion or mistakes.</DIV>
