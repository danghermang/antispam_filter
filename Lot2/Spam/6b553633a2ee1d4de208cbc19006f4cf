Chemo Diary - May 5th - for the past three or four days I have felt pretty back to normal and it has been great! So, tomorrow is my 2nd treatment and we will start the cycle over again and see how it goes. The nurse told me it would go like this- she said just about the time you feel all better, it will be time for the next treatment. Will keep you updated on treatment number 2 as the week goes by!

- DennisHello Dennis,

I'm in almost the same place as you. I will have my second chemo treatment on Monday, May 7th. I also have a pump that runs for 46 hours.

My symptoms.....an odd thing in the back of my throat when I drank something cold, jaws hurting on first bite of each meal or even a piece of gum subsided in a few days but nausea lingered for a week. I'm feeling good right now.Dennis- I too think its a good idea-I wish you susccess with your treatments. so far everything your saying has been the case with mom- only she infortunately had to have all IV treatments with a picc line they could not get her body to accept the port.
stay away from cold- mom described the sensation as if she were drinking shrds of glass- but then again she seems to react more sensitively then some of the others on here. wear gloves when going in and out of your freezer and keep even your meals (not only the drinks) at room temp when possible. If your mouth becomes so sensitive that bread and crackers hurt try useing flour tortillas in place of them for whatever such as sandwhichs.. its softer and doesnt dig at the gums as much. when mom developed mouth sores she found chewing very small bites with the front teeth easier doesnt look so appealing to the onlooker but hey...whatever works just to get it down.Hi Dennis, just checking in re my treatment. Feeling good today. Do you have to use the toilet more frequently? That and the nausea is probably the only worry at the moment. I start my second cycle on Thursday 10 May so I will be interested to see if other problems come up. From reading the posts it sound like a few of us
  are all starting our cycles at about the same time which will be good to compare. AnnaThe cold sensitivity and neuropathy will get worse with time. At least you are getting your treatments in warmer weather. My treatments were during the winter. The only bad thing about getting oxaliplatin in the summer is that you won't be able to drink anything cold. By the 5th or 6th treatment it is likely that the oncologist will begin to reduce the dose of the oxaliplatin. My oncologist told me that he has never had a patient to get all 12 treatments of FOLFOX at full dosage.Dennis- I too think its a good idea-I wish you susccess with your treatments. so far everything your saying has been the case with mom- only she infortunately had to have all IV treatments with a picc line they could not get her body to accept the port.
