Subject:I'll be true to you
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very kind and generous. 
I am keen on sports. Sports play a very significant role in my life, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. 
It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, educated and with good sense of humor. 

I want to love and to be loved http://zapoyako.worthlessorwonderful.com Let's start our acquaintance
