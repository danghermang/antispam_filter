Subject:The Ultimate Shortcut For Newbies...
Hey,

Most shortcuts kind of suck... 

You see, they're typically designed to give you one, or
maybe two streams of income that eventually dry up, and
leave you no better than where you started. They're all
based on short-lived, dumbed down gimmicks.

But, not this one...

This is the kind of shortcut I can get behind, one that
hands you hundreds of streams of income... and by hands
them to you, I mean...

You don't have to ANY of the work yourself!

Now that's a REAL shortcut...

Best of all, your hundreds of streams of income aren't
going to dry up on you in a couple of weeks... they're
going to grow, and keep on growing as long as you have
them... even if you just let them sit there.

This is the ultimate shortcut, and I can't think of an
easier way for you to start collecting multiple checks
each, and every month...

Thanks & Good Luck,
Gary Ambrose

P.S. Don't worry if you're not comfortable with all the
technical stuff... that's why this is called a shorcut.
