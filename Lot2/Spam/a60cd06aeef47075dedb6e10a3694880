Subject:My Happiness - it's you
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very pretty and responsive. I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be serious, educated and very attentive. I want to love and to be loved http://yejijew.cjjb.net Let's begin our acquaintance
