Of the two thousand 28214_C0AF72258559 28214_C0AF72258559 Hostess  13248336966a39325c0af7fd7306ce42Brands documents filed in the last year with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, it's one of the most recent ones - a handwritten, five-page letter on loose-leaf notebook paper - that stands out the most.
In document #1890, Don Sheridan of Wellesley, Mass., 13248336966a39325c0af7fd7306ce42 writes to say the Judge, the CEO, and the company's advisers should allow him to prepare a proposal for the Twinkie maker and its 30 brands. 28214_C0AF72258559
