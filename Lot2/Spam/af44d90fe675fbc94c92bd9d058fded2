Attention Beneficiary,
 
We wish to inform you that the United Nations (UN) has taken over the Inheritance/Prize Winning payment
issue which you currently or previously had with your transaction agents. Your funds have being withdrawn
by UN on your behalf based on the fact that you were subjected to too many processes that will make you
spend more money before receiving your funds.Your Inheritance/Winning payment was paid out to the 
United Nations Organization, and they have succeeded in depositing your funds with us. 
 
They have ordered Western Union to take full responsibility in the transfer process of your funds, and we
have received your application for the first instalment of $7,500 USD from the total amount of $1,500,000
(One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).
 
For some security reasons, we need you to reconfirm your Name, Address, Age and Phone Number before 
receiving the MTCN for the first instalment, and we will be sending you each MTCN details after every 24 
hours of receiving each payment.
