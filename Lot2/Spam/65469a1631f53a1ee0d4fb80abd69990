Attn: Beneficiary,

The World Bank and United Nations Organization have officially approved to pay you part payment of your contract/inheritance/award funds. This decision was made last week. With this development, a woman by name (MRS. JANET GIBSON) came to our office with an application stating that you gave her the power of attorney to be the beneficiary of your outstanding contract/Inheritance/award funds. She made us to believe that you are dead and that she is your next of kin. We got your email address and decided to send an email through this address hoping to find out if you are dead or alive and also to find out if you at any time give this woman the power of attorney to represent you.

Please let us know also if you are aware of this development, hence we are almost ready to transfer part payment of $3.3m US of your outstanding funds to her nominated bank account stated below::
