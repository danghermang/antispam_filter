Subject:Hy how much?
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very nice and romantic. 

I like sea and sun. I adore just laying under the sun and receive sunbathes.. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, reliable and with various interests. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://rvycfilp.5ballov.ru Let's begin our acquaintance
