    compiled by Pastor Bill:<br>
    <br>
    10. Begin to weave --- Jesus provides the thread.<br>
    <br>
    9. We set the sail --- the Holy Spirit brings the wind. <br>
    <br>
    8. Fear knocked. Faith answered. No one was there.<br>
    <br>
    7. If you feel far away from God --- guess who moved? <br>
    <br>
    6. God promises me a safe landing --- not a calm passage. <br>
    <br>
    5. I am God's melody in life --- He sings His song through me.<br>
    <br>
    4. Why are you running around looking for God? He's not lost.<br>
    <br>
    3. With Jesus I am responsible for the effort --- not the outcome. <br>
    <br>
    2. Peace is not freedom from the storm --- it's peace amid the storm.<br>
    <br>
    And the number one Christian Epigram as compiled by Pastor Bill.<br>
    <br>
    1. Jesus has a purpose and plan for me --- that no one else can fulfill.<br>
    <br>
    <b>
    <font color="#FF0000">Prayer:</font></b> Father thank you that you care for 
    my life and are here for me. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
    Amen!</font></td>
