Dear Broker, <br/> <br/>


Cover Agency's Homeowner's markets  are available to our brokers.<br/> <br/>


We have several markets, including No Second Wind Hurricane Deductible program. <br/><br/>

Many brokers are renewing policies in our "No Second  Hurricane Deductible" program. It's <br/>
good for your customer, and reduces the possibility of an E and O claim! <br/> <br/>

Example: A 5%  Hurricane deductible, means a $20,000 "owner paid deductible" for $400,000   <br/>
in building insurance. Do the deductible numbers for your renewals. How many customers    <br/>
have that money laying around?<br/><br/>

Join our broker correspondent group today. <br/> <br/>

Great Commissions! <br/> <br/>
