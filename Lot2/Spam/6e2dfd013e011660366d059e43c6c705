Greetings from George Daniels

I am George Daniels, a Banker and credit system programmer (HSBC bank).
I saw your email address while browsing through  the bank DTC Screen in 
my office
yesterday so I decided to use this very chance to know you. I believe
we should use every opportunity to know each other better. However, I 
am contacting you
for obvious reason which you will understand.

I am sending this mail just to know if this email address is OK,
reply me back so that I will send  more details to you.
I have a very important thing to discuss with you, I look forward to 
receiving your reponse at
g_george35@aol.com. Have a pleasant day.

George Daniels
