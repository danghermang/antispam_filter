Subject:Can I trust you



 Good day,
I am Mr. Andrew Malema,
Personal assistant to Saif AL-Gaddafi the Last son of
Muammar Gaddafi of Libya.

I am presently in South Africa because of the crises going on in Libya at
the very moment.
I wish to seek your hand in business which will benefit us both if carried
out in a perfect manner.

I am in position of documents that was used to deposit the total sum of
$47,500,000.00 in a security company here in South Africa which was
deposited by myself  and this money was kept for security purposes because
of the
fear of a civil war which will surely lead to the confiscation of all
their assets in their Libya.
I am looking to find the most
possible means to move this fund out of South Africa before I left Libya
and HE told me to get back to Libya once  the civil war crises has
ended because HE can not communicate with me while I am outside the
country because of security reasons and I can only communicate with him
via blackberry chat.

The news of his death is shocking but was actually expected because of the
troubles they are giving to their country and now that he is dead, I have
to do everything possible to get this money as no one is going to make
claims to the fund because there is no next of kin to his account because
he hid this money for security reason.

I found your contact while browsing through the internet to find someone
with a lucrative business who can be able to handle this fund without
problems.

I have worked as his personal assistant for 3 years and to tell you the
truth, I intend to take this fund for myself because I have also lost
everything back in Libya already and I don't intend going back.

I seek your assistance and if you can assist, call me on this telephone
number so that I will get back to you.

Phone: +27 735 653327

I would appreciate very much if you call.

Regards

Mr. Andrew Malema
