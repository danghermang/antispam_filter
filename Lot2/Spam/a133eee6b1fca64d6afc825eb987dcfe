<b>

Time to Start Investing Again? Three Questions to Ask Yourself First

</b></font><br />
<p><font face=3D"arial" color=3D"#252525" size=3D2>

Online investing is touted by many to be the wave of the future. After deal=
ing with "corrupt" brokers and other financial planners, many people have d=
ecided to take matters into their own hands. To this end, banks and other f=
inancial institutions, which have struggled with maintaining their customer=
 base after the collapse of the US banking system, are getting into the inv=
estment game themselves.
<br /><br />
Well-established national banks, such as Bank of America, have even gone so=
 far as to initiate their own online brokerages. The idea, in general, is t=
hat as the stock market improves, along with other investment vehicles, mor=
e investors will turn towards managing their own accounts. However, before =
you close your traditional brokerage account altogether, here are a few que=
stions to ask yourself:
<br /><br />
<b>Do you know anything about investments?</b>
<br /><br />
This is the most important question. Honestly, it is not a good idea to tak=
e on your own brokerage account, in other words investing your own money, i=
f you are unfamiliar with the concepts behind investment. You'll need more =
than a general understanding; you will need to be able to research your acc=
ounts, identify signs that your account is going down, and be able to mitig=
ate those effects.
<br /><br />
While whatever online brokerage that you use - whether supplied by your ban=
k or not - will likely have some sort of advice, commentary, tools, etc., d=
esigned to help you manage your account, these tools are useless if you do =
not understand what they measure, how they measure it, and the accuracy the=
ir predictions.
<br /><br />
Further, you will need understand the fees associated with your account so =
that you know that a stock changing position a few degrees may not be worth=
 the sale if the fees associated with that trade are too high.
<br /><br />
<b>Do you have the time?</b>
<br /><br />
Coupled with the issue of "knowledge" is the issue of "time." Professional =
financial planners, brokers, and other such positions, are educated in the =
field of finance. This is what they do all day long. As such, they research=
 what is happening in the investment markets on a daily, if not hourly, bas=
is; they are up to date on involvement in the economy and in the business w=
orld that could affect an investment; and they can even leverage informatio=
n gleaned between accounts.
<br /><br />
You, on the other hand, likely do not have the same time available to you n=
or the knowledge to be able to research the issues as quickly.
<br /><br />
<b>Do you have enough?</b>
<br /><br />
In order to invest independently, most online brokerages will require a min=
imum deposit. As fed up as you may be with the finance market in general, a=
nd would like to handle your 401(k) on your own, the simple fact is that, u=
nless you withdraw the money and pay the appropriate penalties, you simply =
cannot.
<br /><br />
If you want to try your hand at independent investing before making such a =
drastic move as with drawing your 401(k) early, you are going to need sever=
al thousand dollars to meet the minimum deposit.
