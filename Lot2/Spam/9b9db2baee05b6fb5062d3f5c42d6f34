<span>Contact western Union now<br />I have deposited the check as we agreed with western Union. All you have to do is to contact them at:<br />w_union4@kimo.com they will give you direction on how you will be receiving the funds daily. My agreement with them is 10,000USD daily until the whole of 1.5 USD is tranfered.<br />You are not expected to pay for the tansfer charge as that will be deducted from the funds once the remittance is done. The only fee you will send to them before the transfer is 148 USD for paper work and remittance.<br />Email them with above address, the contact person is Dr Grace Townsend,with phone number; +229 99386892<br />Thank you.<br />John Marthins<br />Your Funds transfer is Ready</span><br>
