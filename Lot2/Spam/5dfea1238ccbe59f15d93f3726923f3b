<p>Do you know what threats make it past your firewall and defenses? According to the latest data breach report by Verizon, most organizations don&rsquo;t. The report states that external attacks on a network have dramatically increased over the past few years and a majority of the breaches are detected by 3<sup>rd</sup> party companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses are so concerned about their perimeter defenses that they fail to understand their biggest internal security weakness. Most don&rsquo;t know who is performing reconnaissance activity against their infrastructure. They don&rsquo;t know if Backdoors / Trojans / Botnets / APTs are currently communicating /ex-filtrating sensitive data out of their networks. Additionally, they don&rsquo;t know if their IDS is configured with the appropriate signatures. And perhaps most importantly, they don&rsquo;t know if their security devices are sharing information in a way to better protect them against an attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A network assessment can easily begin to help address some of these issues; however typical enterprise security assessments only look at a &lsquo;one time&rsquo; snapshot of a small section of a network infrastructure. These assessments do not attempt to look for recently discovered Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) type attacks that a typical antivirus will not be able to pick up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Default">There is a new holistic approach to network security assessments called the 360 Living Security Audit. This assessment beats traditional network security assessments by covering a network on three layers, over an extended period of time, which translates into a more accurate picture of a network&rsquo;s true security status.</p>
