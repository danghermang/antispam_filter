Subject:Mitch Hawker Wood Coaster Poll 2012
The Mitch Hawker Wood Coaster Poll is BACK!

We have started a discussion about it, including where to fill out the

coasters, etc. Click this link for the information:

We simply cannot stress enough HOW IMPORTANT this poll is! This poll
is what many parks base actual ranking of coasters from. It is open to
EVERYONE to submit at ballot, and regardless if you've ridden 1 or 100
wooden roller coasters...

YOUR OPINION COUNTS!!!

So please, click the link, get the information about the poll and
please submit your ballot! DO IT NOW! =)

Thank you!
