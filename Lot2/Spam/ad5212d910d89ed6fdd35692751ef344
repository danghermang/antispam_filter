Hello ,

I have contacted you because I have carried out research into a =20
dormant account of a deceased client at the financial institute where =20
I presently audit its accounts; here in the United Kingdom and the =20
client has no heirs. The account has a significant amount of money in =20
it. An account is judged to be dormant if there has been no activity =20
in it, or contact with the client, for 15 years. Normally, account =20
holders lose contact due to death without leaving a will and there's =20
no known heir to inherit. The treasury department receives the =20
unclaimed money unless a previously unknown distant relative, comes =20
and puts a claim on it; which is usually within a limited time frame.

The United Kingdom?s Treasury Department receives over =A310bn every =20
year from unclaimed estates; forgotten funds; abandoned shares and =20
dormant accounts and some of it could be ours if we can work together =20
as I can provide all relevant documents and information. We could =20
present you as the next of kin to deceased, as laid out in section 46 =20
of the Administration of Estates Act of 1925 (with subsequent =20
amendments) if you agree to work with me.

I will need to enter into an agreement with you, which will cover the =20
disbursement aspect of funds. Furthermore, you will have to sign a =20
consent form that gives the lawyer power of attorney to represent you =20
at the probate office (for the Procurement of the Grant of Probate). =20
The amount in question currently stands at six million British Pounds =20
Sterling only.

At the closure of this transaction, 30% of the total funds will be =20
yours. So, if you would like to team up with me discreetly to secure =20
these funds for ourselves, please have your full information sent to =20
me which include, full name, address, age, occupation and contact =20
number(s).

I await your careful considered answer as when we proceed we cannot =20
stop half way, as this is one in a life time opportunity to go big.

Sincerely,
Mr.Andrew Peterson
