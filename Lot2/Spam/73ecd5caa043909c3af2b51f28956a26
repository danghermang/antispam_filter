      A book like no other on this earth.&nbsp; Not a few cartoons or an
      infantile movie trailer but 234 page novel which insults Islam like no
      other.&nbsp; A parody of the always drunk proprietor of &quot;Mohamma=
d's
      Saloon &amp; Brothel&quot; with his completely ridiculous life expose=
d.&nbsp;
      This moronic child molestating coward and fool who bumps his way thro=
ugh
      life oblivious to his manipulation as the figurehead of another new=
=20
      religion.&nbsp; Learn about his adopted son and heir Ali, the biggest
      swish ever to sashay across Arabia while sadistically running Mecca's
      largest boy's brothel.&nbsp; Only $9.99 to laugh at, mock, and ridicu=
le
      those fanatics who do not&nbsp;enjoy being ridiculed.&nbsp; A well wr=
itten
      and extremely funny parody at Amazon.com.
