Subject:The most beautiful unmarried girls
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very kind and generous. 

I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. 
It seems to be banal to describe imaginary image of a loved one. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be serious, reliable and with good sense of humor. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://yipuqiya.prohosts.org If you want to know me better
