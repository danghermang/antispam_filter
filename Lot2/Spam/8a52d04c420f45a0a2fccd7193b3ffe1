Subject:I Seeking cavalier - you
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and generous. 

I like sea and sun. I adore just laying under the sun and receive sunbathes.. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be serious, communicative and with good sense of humor. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://yaxogib.phpnet.us Let's begin our acquaintance
