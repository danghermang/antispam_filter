Subject:Body slim
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very beautiful and romantic. I am keen on sports. Sports play a very significant role in my life, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be ambitious, communicative and with good sense of humor. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://tovanuhe.metrohosting.info Let's begin our acquaintance
