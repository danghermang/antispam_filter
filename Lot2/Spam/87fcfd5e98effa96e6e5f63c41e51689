Subject:Do you know? - Mon, 10 Dec 2012
Hail! I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very kind and responsive. I enjoy simple things. I am very good at cooking and drawing.. It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be positive, reliable and with various interests. I want to love and to be loved. Let's start our acquaintance http://japiyev.hyderabadadda.in
