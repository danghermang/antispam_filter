A hose is a hollow tube designed to carry fluids from one location to another. Hoses are also sometimes called pipes (the word pipe usually refers to a rigid tube, whereas a hose is usually a flexible one), or more generally tubing. The shape of a hose is usually cylindrical (having a circular cross section).

Hose design is based on a combination of application and performance. Common factors are Size, Pressure Rating, Weight, Length, Straight hose or Coilhose and Chemical Compatibility.

Hoses are made from one or a combination of many different materials. Applications mostly use nylon, polyurethane, polyethylene, PVC, or synthetic or natural rubbers, based on the environment and pressure rating needed. In recent years, hoses can also be manufactured from special grades of polyethylene (LDPE and especially LLDPE). Other hose materials include PTFE (Teflon), stainless steel and other metals.

Hoses can be used in water or other liquid environments or to convey air or other gases. Hoses are used to carry fluids through air or fluid environments, and they are typically used with clamps, spigots, flanges, and nozzles to control fluid flow.

Specific applications include the following:

A garden hose is used to water plants in a garden or lawn, or to convey water to a sprinkler for the same purpose.
A Tough Hose is used to water crops in agriculture for drip irrigation In some cases, one of the more complex formulae given below will be more useful
 so I don't consider it a con.
Overall I would totally suggest this laptop to the gamer or design student

A fire hose is used by firefighters to convey water to the site of a fire.
Air hoses are used in underwater diving to carry air from a surface compressor or from air tanks. (See also Snorkeling.) Industrial uses for operating flexible machinery and worktable tooling such as pneumatic screw drivers, grinders, staplers, etc.
Hoses have been used in air brake systems ever since the technology was invented by George Westinghouse in 1868. This includes:
Railway air brake hoses used between locomotives and railroad cars, and
Truck air brake hoses used between tractors and semi-trailers. probably to the same species with that

``There's the Parrot!' cried Scrooge. ``Green body and yellow tailThere are three classes of manufactured tubing: seamless, as-welded or electric resistant welded (ERW), and drawn-over-mandrel (DOM).

Seamless tubing is produced via extrusion or rotary piercing.
Drawn-over-mandrel tubing is made from cold-drawn electrical-resistance-welded tube that is drawn through a die and over a mandrel to create such characteristics as dependable weld integrity, dimensional accuracy, and an excellent surface finish.
Standards

There are many industry and government standards for pipe and tubing. Many standards exist for tube manufacture; some of the most common are as follows:

ASTM A213 Standard Specification for Seamless Ferritic and Austenitic Alloy-Steel Boiler, Superheater, Heat-Exchanger Tubes.
ASTM A269 Standard Specification for Seamless and Welded Austenitic Stainless Steel Tubing for General Service
ASTM A270 Standard Specification for Seamless and Welded Austenitic Stainless Steel Sanitary Tubing
ASTM A511 Standard Specification for Seamless Stainless Steel Mechanical Tubing
ASTM A513 Standard Specification for Electric-Resistance-Welded Carbon and Alloy Steel Mechanical Tubing
ASTM A554 Standard Specification for Welded Stainless Steel Mechanical Tubing
British Standard 1387:1985 Specification for screwed and socketed steel tubes and tubulars and for plain end steel tubes suitable for welding or for screwing to BS 21 pipe threads
ASTM material specifications generally cover a variety of grades or types that indicate a specific material composition. Some of the most commonly used are:

TP 304
TP 316
MT 304
MT 403
MT 506
In installations using hydrogen, copper and stainless steel tubing must be factory pre-cleaned (ASTM B 280) and/or certified as instrument grade. This is due to hydrogen's particular propensities: to explode in the presence of oxygen, oxygenation sources, or contaminants; to leak due to its atomic size; and to cause embrittlement of metals, particularly under pressure.

In building services, metal or plastic hoses are used to move water around a building; whilst air ducts are used to move air around (see air conditioning). They can also be used to take out vibration, and thermal or settlement movement.
Automotive hoses are used in automobiles to move fluids around for use in cooling, lubrication, and/or hydraulics. Hoses are also used to convey pressure or vacuum signals to control circuits or gauges, as well as conveying vacuum to heating, cooling, brake, and/or locking systems.
In chemistry and medicine, hoses (usually called tubes) are used to move liquid chemicals or gases around.
A fuel hose carries fuel.
