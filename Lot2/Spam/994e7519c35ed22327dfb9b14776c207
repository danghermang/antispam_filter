Hi! I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very beautiful and generous. I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, educated and with good sense of humor. I want to love and to be loved. Let's start our acquaintance http://bajizez.sbscchost.com
