opportunity. An over ten years Dormant Online Fixed Account of Twelve
Million, Nine Hundred and Eighty Eight Thousand United States Dollars
($12,988,000.00) accrued interest inclusive I discovered and monitored.

Customer at the initial stage of completing account opening documentation is
required to provide the name(s) of his /her next of kin, for unforeseen
events.Some people mostly politicians, government officers and non-residential
prefers online banking correspondence, rather than being physical in the bank.
United Arab Emirates financial law stipulates that all amount in Dormant
account to be remitted into Emirates Treasury Account after seven years
no-operational.

I wish to enter into partnership with you and invest the funds in your

account from your country, with address and other details. which will be
furnish to the bank for ease in processing fund transfer.
