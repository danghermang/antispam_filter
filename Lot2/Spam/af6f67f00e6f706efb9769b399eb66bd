I suffered the death of my family my wife and children, due to the ongoing battle between the Gaddafi soldiers and the Independent Rebels. 

My main purpose of contacting you is that, Before i came back home here in Libya, i deposited the sum of £4.8m, FOUR MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS with a Bank when i was still living in England which i planned to use for the development of the less privileged.
