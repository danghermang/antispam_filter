I am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart. With due respect trust and humanity, i appeal to you to exercise a little patience and read through my letter i feel quite safe dealing with you in this important call,
 
I am Mrs Iren Smith from ENGLAND 64 years old, 6fit tall fair, married to a citizen of America., I came to internet, because I needed a friend I could trust, to help me see the need of less-privileges in your country I am deaf and suffering from a long time cancer of the breast which also affected my brain, according to my doctors they have advised me that i may not live for the next two months, this is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage.
 
I was brought up from a motherless babies home was married to my late husband for twenty years without a child, my late husband died in a fatal motor accident. I sold all my inherited belongings and deposited all the sum of $5million dollars with HSBC BANK LONDON. Presently,
 
I'm with my laptop in a hospital where my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see that this money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed each year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless babies’ home where i come from. I want you use this money to fund ,orphanages and widows, I took this decision, before i rest in peace because my time will soon be up.
 
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank.
 
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you soon.a
 
Mrs Iren Smith
