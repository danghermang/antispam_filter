Subject:I look forward to
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and romantic. I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be ambitious, communicative and very attentive. I want to love and to be loved http://sakosiwa.thport.com Let's start our acquaintance
