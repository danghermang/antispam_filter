<br>
Due to suspicious activity, your Battle.net account has been locked. You tried 
to login your account too many times (403). We are concerned about whether your 
account has been stolen. In order to guarantee the legitimacy of your account, 
we need you follow these steps:<br>
<br>
Step 1: Secure Your Computer<br>
<br>
In the event that your computer has been infected with malicious software such 
as a keylogger or trojan, simply changing your password may not deter future 
attacks without first ensuring that your computer is free from these programs. 
Please visit our Account Security website to learn how to secure your computer 
from unauthorized access.<br>
<br>
Step 2: Secure Your E-mail Account<br>
After you have secured your computer, check your e-mail filters and rules and 
look for any e-mail forwarding rules that you did not create. For more 
information on securing your e-mail account, visit our Support page.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Restore access to Your account<br>
<br>
We now provide a secure link for you to verify whether you have taken the 
appropriate steps to secure the account, your computer, and your email address. 
Please follow this site to restore the access to your account:<a href="http://eu.battle.net.accountownership-confirmation.net">http://www.battle.net/account/management</a><br>
