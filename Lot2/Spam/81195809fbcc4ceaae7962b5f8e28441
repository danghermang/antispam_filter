Subject:CONTACT BARRISTER MANUEL.
Dearest Friend,

How are you and your family? i pray this email finds you good, I am glad to
inform you that I have successfully concluded the transaction, and the money
has been transferred to London, and It was done through the assistance of Mr.
Howard Ferraro who is a London based Businessman.

Currently I am out of the country with him and my Family. However, I did not
forget you because you are the source of my success, you made me what I am now
though you are not there to complete this DEAL/TRANSACTION with me but I gave
all the credit and thanks to you, I know it is not your fault or rather your
wish to back off on the transaction, I understand it was simply because you
hard no more money to invest in concluding the transaction.

However, in appreciation for your assistance and all that you have invested, I
have mapped out as compensation the sum of US$1,000,000.00 (One million United
State Dollars) in bank draft. This is an international Certified Bank draft
that can be cashed anywhere in the world.

I left the draft with my lawyer Barr. Manuel Nieves on my departure. I would
like you to contact him at once and instruct him where to send the draft to
you, Also do send to him the name in which you wish to cash the draft, so that
he can fill this in before sending it to you, as I left it open due to our
agreement, I have instructed him on this already, try and contact him at once
with the information below:

Name: Barrister Manuel Nieves
Email: barrmanie1@qatar.io
+2348182526615

I would have loved to call you from where I currently reside, but due to
security reasons Mr. Ferraro advised me not to call because of the large
amount that was transferred on my name. Feel free to contact Barr. Manuel
Nieves so that he can release your bank draft to you. I will stop here, till i
write you again.

Regards

Rev. John Frank
Once again, thank you very much and remain blessed
