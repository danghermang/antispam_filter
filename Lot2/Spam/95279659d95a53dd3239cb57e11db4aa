<P><BR>Due to suspicious activity, your Battle.net account&nbsp; has been 
locked. To restore access to this account, please follow these steps:</P>
<P>Step 1: Secure Your Computer</P>
<P>In the event that your computer has been infected with malicious software 
such as a keylogger or trojan, simply changing your password may not deter 
future attacks without first ensuring that your computer </P>
<P>is free from these programs. Please visit our Account Security website to 
learn how to secure your computer from unauthorized access.</P>
<P>Step 2: Secure Your E-mail Account</P>
<P>After you have secured your computer, please create a new password for your 
e-mail account since it may also be compromised. Be sure to check your e-mail 
filters and rules and look for any e-mail forwarding </P>
<P>rules that you did not create. For more information on securing your e-mail 
account, visit this Support page.</P>
<P>Step 3: Choose a New Password</P>
