es, we know that. That seems to be the core of what we are all aiming for. Experientially, not intellectually. 

Where we disagree is the speculations about what the teachings of rebirth are about that you deduce from that. 

As Pink says, it might be better to "not know" rather than have particular views.

Greetings

Even if you dont take anything i have said as proper then look at what Bhikkhuni Dhammadinna has to say (who was praised by the Buddha for what she taught here)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Then Visakha the lay follower went to Dhammadinna the nun and, on arrival, having bowed down to her, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to her, "'Self-identification, self-identification,' it is said, lady. Which self-identification is described by the Blessed One?"

"There are these five clinging-aggregates, friend Visakha: form as a clinging-aggregate, feeling as a clinging-aggregate, perception as a clinging-aggregate, fabrications as a clinging-aggregate, consciousness as a clinging-aggregate. These five clinging-aggregates are the self-identification described by the Blessed One." 

<edit - 1st Noble Truth, about "I am" not physical birth>

Saying, "Yes, lady," Visakha the lay follower delighted & rejoiced in what Dhammadinna the nun had said. Then he asked her a further question: "'The origination of self-identification, the origination of self-identification,' it is said, lady. Which origination of self-identification is described by the Blessed One?"

"The craving that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion & delight, relishing now here & now there — i.e., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming: This, friend Visakha, is the origination of self-identification described by the Blessed One."

<edit - 2nd Noble Truth, craving leads to new identification so new birth of "I am">

"'The cessation of self-identification, the cessation of self-identification,' it is said, lady. Which cessation of self-identification is described by the Blessed One?"

"The remainderless fading & cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, release, & letting go of that very craving: This, friend Visakha, is the cessation of self-identification described by the Blessed One."

<edit - 3rd Noble Truth>

"'The way of practice leading to the cessation of self-identification, the way of practice leading to the cessation of self-identification,' it is said, lady. Which way of practice leading to the cessation of self-identification is described by the Blessed One?"

<edit - 4th Noble Truth>

"Precisely this noble eightfold path — right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration: This, friend Visakha, is the way of practice leading to the cessation of self-identification described by the Blessed One."

Hey Mike

As Pink says, it might be better to "not know" rather than have particular views.


I agree, i dont deny rebirth, all im saying is that is a speculative, unknown view and that actually having such a view has nothing to do with practicing the Buddhas noble teachings

Craig: i dont deny rebirth, all im saying is that is a speculative, unknown view and that actually having such a view has nothing to do with practicing the Buddhas noble teachings.


Except, kamma and paticcasamuppada are “speculative” until one, through one's own efforts gains insight into them. Knowledge of rebirth is open to personal verification just as is anicca, dukkha, anatta, and it can be a way of gaining insight into anicca, dukkha, anatta, paticcasamuppada, as the Buddha’s awakening (as well as others) suttas show.

To claim that rebirth has nothing to do with “practicing the Buddha’s noble teachings,” is to claim a serious lack of textual knowledge, and even more so, as you repeatedly do here, it is to completely ignore any evidence that contradicts your position.

I gave the very famous turtle discourse which directly ties rebirth to the Four Noble Truths:
I quote:
This precious human birth

"Monks, suppose that this great earth were totally covered with water, and a man were to toss a yoke with a single hole there. A wind from the east would push it west, a wind from the west would push it east. A wind from the north would push it south, a wind from the south would push it north. And suppose a blind sea-turtle were there. It would come to the surface once every one hundred years. Now what do you think: would that blind sea-turtle, coming to the surface once every one hundred years, stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole?"

"It would be a sheer coincidence, lord, that the blind sea-turtle, coming to the surface once every one hundred years, would stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole."

"It's likewise a sheer coincidence that one obtains the human state. It's likewise a sheer coincidence that a Tathagata, worthy & rightly self-awakened, arises in the world. It's likewise a sheer coincidence that a doctrine & discipline expounded by a Tathagata appears in the world. Now, this human state has been obtained. A Tathagata, worthy & rightly self-awakened, has arisen in the world. A doctrine & discipline expounded by a Tathagata appears in the world.

"Therefore your duty is the contemplation: 'This is stress...This is the origination of stress...This is the cessation of stress...This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'" — SN 56.48


Craig responds: How often does a "person" endulge in basic desires like a common animal? How many times does a person live in hate and anger and depression like a hell being? How many times is a person lead by pure greed like a hungry shade never being satisfied?

No one is denying the “moment-to-moment” interpretation of paticcasamuppada, but your “answer” here is not really an answer; it does not address the text at all. You have given us no reason to look at this text as figurative.

The problem with your style of argument is that nothing can count against your position. You either do a two-step-side-step dance, avoiding actually addressing the text in question, as you did with the turtle discourse, or you simply ignore what is said, as you did with AN 4.1 I quoted above, which neatly ties rebirth into the practice leading to awakening the Buddha taught. 

Me: “The Mahanidana Sutta, DN 15, is a major, doctrinally complicated discourse by the Buddha to his monk (not lay people) on the subject of paticcasamuppada. In it is this passage, which is quite direct, not a figurative moment-to-moment thing that Craig repeatedly states is the fact of paticcasamupadda:”


Craig: It is an interesting sutta but i think its worth noting that it does stick out as different from other discourses that discuss paticcasamuppada, the use of the word "rebirth" for example instead of Jati

It is different in other ways as well, for example in MN38 it states that paticcasamuppada doesnt occur until after birth, when the human is at a certain age


What is worth noting is your inability to actually deal with an important, large text that places rebirth right in the middle of the paticcasamuppada chain. As for jati, you have ignored what others have said to you about this, offering no real reason that jati must always be taken in a figurative manner, as your position suggests. There is no reason to do so.

You quote a section from MN 38 and state: As we see in this sutta, paticcasamuppada starts after physical birth, when the human is a certain age (the text doesnt state but i go for early/middle childhood) and also, its occurence in present moment.

The problem with your taking a text like this without consideration of the broader context of other texts is that you simply and obviously distort the Buddha’s teachings, as you have been doing. 

“Early/middle childhood?” These texts do not exist as stand alone entities. Since you are the text master here, tell us what the Buddha had to say about babies. 

Also, let us not forget that even if this text is descriptive of what is literally true, as you suggest, it still does not negate paticcasamuppada as an ongoing principle of the functioning of the child as it grows, even before it kicks in the way you seem to think it does.

“These are the Four Noble Truths" - that is the Dhamma taught by me, which is unrefuted, untarnished, unblamed and uncensured by intelligent ascetics and brahmins. . . . Now, on account of what was it said that the Four Noble Truths are the Dhamma taught by me? Based on the six elements there is descent into the womb." Such descent taking place, there is name-and-form." With name-and-form as condition there are the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition there is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Now it is for one who feels that I make known, "This is suffering", "this is the origin of suffering", "This is the cessation of suffering", "This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering". - AN 3 61.


Again, decent into the womb, rebirth, or more accurately, reconception. “Decent into the womb” is certainly less amenable to a figurative reading than jati supposedly is, but even if one squirms around enough to give this a figurative reading, there is also no reason that it cannot be taken as literal. The literal reading is no less true than the “moment-to-moment,” and it often requires far less pretzelization of logic for it to make sense. This is not an either-or situation. So, with AN 3 61 we have rebirth tied directly to the Four Noble truths and paticcasamuppada. 

Craig: There is no rebirth in MN26

The relevant passage:
"So I [the Buddha], monks being liable to birth because of self, having known the perils in what is liable to birth, seeking freedom from birth, the uttermost security from the bonds -- nibbana -- won freedom from birth , the uttermost security from the bonds -- nibbana...."

..

"Then the group of five monks, being thus exhorted, this instructed by me [the Buddha], being liable to birth because of self, having known the perils in what is liable to birth, seeking freedom from birth, the
uttermost security from the bonds -- nibbana  -- won freedom from birth , the uttermost security from the bonds -- nibbana...." Majjhima Nikaya I 167 and 173.

Let’s see here. If I have not attainted nibbana, after I die, I’ll be reborn, which means I am, as an unawakened person, still liable to birth. Looks like the text is very directly referring to rebirth. 

Craig: His own teachings of the 4NT (and so D.O.), which i have already described, have no rebirth in them

As we see, this claim has been shown to be simply wrong.

What is the use of his knowledge
pertaining to the number of insects in the whole world?

I don't usually join theses endless rebirth debates. 

The reason is that it seems to be a matter of personal belief. You can find support in ancient teachings but at the end of the day it comes down to what "makes sense" for you. It's a personal matter. Like a born-again Christian saying we will be left behind during the rapture, that we need to accept Jesus as our personal savior, metaphysics involves faith, and belief in what is unseen and unproven (in the scientific sense).

I see no utility in arguing this with anyone. People believe different things, it just feels right, or it doesn't.

That said, I do believe in rebirth. Not because of what ancient texts (passed on orally, translated into different languages) present as the "words of the Buddha" 2,500 years ago. I believe it cause it just makes sense to me on a deep level, feels right, feels true.


"As Buddhists, we should aim to develop relationships that are not predominated by grasping and clinging. Our relationships should be characterised by the brahmaviharas of metta (loving kindness), mudita (sympathetic joy), karuna (compassion), and upekkha (equanimity)."

Of course, but the issue here for me is not if rebirth is in fact true, but what is its position within the Buddha's teachings. Do we take a anachronistic revisionist stance as Craig wants us to assume is THE way to understand things, or do we take the texts at more or less face value. What we do after that is a matter of personal choice.

Is it really limited to those two choices? Can we really not just say "I don't know" and leave it at that, no matter what our persistent preference is?

Aren't they both simply personal choices?

I do not know what the tradition says, or I don't know if rebirth is true?

The Theravadin traditions says there is rebirth, and certainly this is borne out by the texts upon which it is based. 

Is rebirth the way the universe actually operates? How one relates to that is certainly a personal issue.
