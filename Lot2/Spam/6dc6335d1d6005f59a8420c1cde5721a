<br><strong>People are rational =E2=80=93  but markets aren=E2=80=99t</stro=
ng><br>
<br>Efficient market theory has never made much sense. <br>
<br>Recent history proves that. Two catastrophic stock market  crashes insi=
de ten years. A devastating global property bubble. Today=E2=80=99s  burgeo=
ning bond bubble. None of this is evidence of an efficient market.<br>
<br>And it=E2=80=99s hard to believe that anyone beyond the most  isolated =
ivory towers in academia takes it seriously these days. <br>
<br>The reason the theory has survived so long is because it  provides a co=
nvenient, clever-sounding rationale to excuse the self-serving  behaviour o=
f everyone involved in investment markets. <br>
<br>Central bankers, for example, argued that if markets were  efficient, t=
hen bubbles couldn=E2=80=99t exist (because prices would always be correct)=
.  So who were they to puncture them? <br>
<br>They ignored the fact that the very existence of a central  bank, which=
 sets the most important price of all (the price of money), destroys  the i=
dea of an efficient market. Especially if the central bank only ever acts  =
to prop up falling asset prices. <br>
<br>But it=E2=80=99s not just central bankers who are the problem. It=E2=80=
=99s  the people we pay to manage our money for us. The FT=E2=80=99s John P=
lender has written  an interesting piece on a new paper by Paul Woolley and=
 Dimitri Vayanos of the  London School of Economics. <br>
<br>The problem, say Woolley and Vayanos, is =E2=80=9Cinformation  asymmetr=
y=E2=80=9D. What this boils down to is that when you give your money to an =
 intermediary to invest on your behalf, the incentives change. <br>
<br>These intermediaries =E2=80=9Cact rationally in the pursuit of  profit =
=E2=80=93 but not necessarily the profit of the ultimate beneficiaries [the=
  actual investors].=E2=80=9D <br>
<br>To understand how this works, let=E2=80=99s take the process of  sellin=
g a house. You take on an estate agent who reckons he can sell your house  =
for =C2=A3325,000. You agree a fee of 1.5%. <br>
<br>You might think that the agent will be just as motivated as  you are to=
 get the best price possible. But think about it. 1.5% of =C2=A3325,000 is =
 =C2=A34,875. 1.5% of =C2=A3300,000 is =C2=A34,500. <br>
<br>That extra =C2=A325,000 on the price makes a massive difference  to you=
. But for the agent? Sure, he=E2=80=99ll take the extra =C2=A3375 if he can=
 get it.  But if push comes to shove, he=E2=80=99d almost certainly rather =
have a sale in the bag  at =C2=A3300,000 than stick it out for =C2=A3325,00=
0.<br>
<br>In effect, by delegating the sales process, what=E2=80=99s  =E2=80=98ra=
tional=E2=80=99 has changed. It is rational for you to seek the best price =
you can  get. For the agent, it might be more rational to put in enough eff=
ort to get a  reasonable price, then convince you to settle for it.<br>
<br><strong>The City is more  rapacious than a pack of estate agents</stron=
g><br>
<br>To be fair to estate agents (that=E2=80=99s a phrase I don=E2=80=99t us=
e  very often), the skewed incentives in the financial markets can be far w=
orse. <br>
<br>Fund managers make money by increasing their assets under  management. =
The more money they manage, the more money they make. Being able to  demons=
trate a decent track record is only one small aspect of attracting new  mon=
ey. <br>
<br>More importantly, to avoid losing clients, you don=E2=80=99t have to  b=
e the best manager. You just have to avoid being the worst. So there=E2=80=
=99s a huge  incentive to stick =E2=80=9Cclose to the fund management herd=
=E2=80=9D, as Plender puts it. It  doesn=E2=80=99t matter if you lose money=
 for a client, as long as everyone else is  losing at least as much.<br>
<br>Throw all this into the mix, and it=E2=80=99s no wonder that markets  a=
re anything but efficient. You have an entire group of intermediaries who  =
control the majority of the money in the market, investing on the basis of =
what  all the others are doing. Notes Plender: =E2=80=9Cit seems probably a=
 majority of  equity investment is carried out without regard to the value =
of the equities  being traded.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>In other words, the =E2=80=98irrational=E2=80=99 behaviour in markets i=
s  nothing to do with people as a whole being irrational. The real problem =
is that  we hand the job to a financial industry which is more interested i=
n its own  profits, than in our returns. <br>
<br>This is why it=E2=80=99s worth taking charge of your own money. Because=
  not only do you get to cut out the middlemen. You can also take advantage=
 of  their herding behaviour, by buying the assets that they are neglecting=
, and  avoiding the ones that they are piling into. <br>
