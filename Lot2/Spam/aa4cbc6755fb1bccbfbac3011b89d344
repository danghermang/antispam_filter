said to her.  He sat down with a smile, facing her, felt her pulse, and again   
began asking her tiresome questions.  She 5586957442002475370 answered him, and all at once got up, furious. 
 "Excuse 1197255869 5586957442002475370 me, doctor, but there is really no object in this.  This is the third time you've asked me the same thing." 
 The celebrated doctor did not take offense.  "Nervous  irritability," he said to 5586957442002475370 the princess, when Kitty had 
left the room.  "However, I had finished..."  And 5586957442002475370 the doctor began scientifically 5586957442002475370 explaining to the princess, 
as an exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the 5769cb9a99e6677be91f17b60968b28e young princess, and concluded by insisting on the drinking of 
the waters, which were certainly harmless.  At the question:  Should they go abroad? the doctor plunged into deep meditation, 
as though NDY1OGJhODk4OGQ1NTY2YWQ4MWYxN2I2MDk2OGIyOGU_ resolving a weighty problem.  Finally his decision was pronounced:  they NDY1OGJhODk4OGQ1NTY2YWQ4MWYxN2I2MDk2OGIyOGU_ were to go abroad, but to put no faith in 
foreign quacks, and to apply to  him in any need.  It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come 5769cb9a99e6677be91f17b60968b28e to pass 
after the doctor had gone.  The mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter, and Kitty pretended to be   
more 1197255869 NDY1OGJhODk4OGQ1NTY2YWQ4MWYxN2I2MDk2OGIyOGU_ cheerful.  She had often, almost always, to be pretending now.  "Really, I'm quite well, mamma.  But if you want to go abroad, 
let's go!" she said, and trying 5586957442002475370 to 5586957442002475370 appear interested in the proposed tour, she began talking of the preparations for the 
journey.    Chapter 2  5769cb9a99e6677be91f17b60968b28e   Soon after the doctor, Dolly had arrived.  She knew that there 
was to be a consultation that day, and though she was 5586957442002475370 only 5586957442002475370 just up after her confinement (she had another baby, a little girl, 
born at the end 5586957442002475370 of the winter), though she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own, she had left NDY1OGJhODk4OGQ1NTY2YWQ4MWYxN2I2MDk2OGIyOGU_ her tiny baby and a sick 
child, to come and hear Kitty's  fate, which was to be decided that 5586957442002475370 day. 
 "Well, well?" she said, NDY1OGJhODk4OGQ1NTY2YWQ4MWYxN2I2MDk2OGIyOGU_ coming into the drawing 5586957442002475370 room, without taking off her hat.  "You're all in good spirits.  Good news, 
then?"  5769cb9a99e6677be91f17b60968b28e They tried 5586957442002475370 to tell her what the doctor had said, but it appeared 
that though the doctor had  talked distinctly enough and at great length, it was utterly impossible to report what he had  said. 
The only point of interest was that it was settled they should go abroad.  5769cb9a99e6677be91f17b60968b28e 
 Dolly could not   help sighing.  Her dearest friend, her sister, was going away.  And her life was not a cheerful one.  Her 
relations 5586957442002475370 with Stepan Arkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating.  The union Anna had cemented turned out to be 
of no solid character, and family harmony was breaking down again at the same point.   There had been nothing definite, but Stepan 
Arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home; money, too, was 1197255869 hardly ever forthcoming, 5769cb9a99e6677be91f17b60968b28e and Dolly was continually tortured by suspicions of 
infidelity, 1197255869 which she tried to dismiss, dreading the NDY1OGJhODk4OGQ1NTY2YWQ4MWYxN2I2MDk2OGIyOGU_ agonies of jealousy she had been through already.  The first onslaught of 
jealousy, once lived through, could never come back again, and 5769cb9a99e6677be91f17b60968b28e even the discovery of infidelities could never now affect her as 
it 5586957442002475370  had the first time.  Such a discovery now would only mean breaking up family habits, and she let herself be deceived, 
despising him  and still more herself, for the 5586957442002475370 weakness.  Besides this, the care of her large family was a constant worry to her: 
first, the nursing of her NDY1OGJhODk4OGQ1NTY2YWQ4MWYxN2I2MDk2OGIyOGU_ young baby did not go well, then the nurse had gone away, NDY1OGJhODk4OGQ1NTY2YWQ4MWYxN2I2MDk2OGIyOGU_ now one of the children had fallen ill. 
 "Well, how are all of you?" asked her mother. 5769cb9a99e6677be91f17b60968b28e   "Ah, mamma, we have plenty of troubles of our own.  Lili is ill, .
