Subject:HOW ARE YOU DOING?
MY GOOD FRIEND ,

MY NAME IS MR. DAVID KWAME.I AM A RETIRED BANKER OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK IN GHANA WEST AFRICA, I AM A CHRISTIAN.

I DO NOT WANT PROBLEMS BUT I JUST HOPE YOU CAN ASSIST ME, I WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN GOOD FAITH, I HAVE A TRANSACTION OF FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND US DOLLAR:($4,520,000.00USD).

I REALIZED THIS FUND FROM BANK EXCESS PROFIT AFTER TRADING WITH THE CAPITAL SUM AND I DEPOSITED THE FUNDS IN ESCROW CALL ACCOUNT; WHERE NOBODY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO IT; EVEN THE BANK DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THIS ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE DEDUCTED; UNTIL AFTER THE TRANSFER.

FINALLY I DID NOT DECLARE THIS FUND TO THE BANK BEFORE MY RETIREMENT. I AM CONTACTING YOU, TO STAND AS THE BENEFICIARY OF THIS FUND BECAUSE ONLY A FOREIGNER CAN STAND AS THE BENEFICIARY, CAN I TRUST YOU TO HOLD THIS MONEY FOR ME UNTIL I COME OVER TO YOUR COUNTRY? AFTER THE TRANSFER, I WILL GIVE YOU 30% OF THE MONEY AS YOUR COMMISSION.

IF YOU ACCEPT MY OFFER, BUT IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS OFFER KINDLY FORGET THAT I CONTACTED YOU, ALL I NEED IS FOR YOU TO GET A GOOD CURRENT ACCOUNT WHERE THIS FUND CAN BE TRANSFERRED INTO AND FOR YOU TO STAND AS THE BENEFICIARY OF THE SAID AMOUNT; WITHIN THREE DAYS THE FUNDS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO YOUR DESIGNATED BANK ACCOUNT.

THERE ARE PRACTICALLY NO RISKS INVOLVED; IT WILL BE A BANK-TO-BANK TRANSFER. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND MY SITUATION, I AM CRITICALLY ILL THAT IS WHY I CONTACTED YOU TO FINALIZE THIS TRANSACTION TO ENABLE ME HAVE A VERY GOOD TREATMENT.

MAY GOD BLESS YOU  AND YOUR FAMILY. I WAIT YOUR URGENT REPLY

BEST REGARDS,

MR.  DAVID KWAME.
