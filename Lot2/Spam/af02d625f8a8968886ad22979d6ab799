Subject:Last Chance To Learn Affiliate Marketing 2.0...
Hey,

Alright, I'm going to cut to the chase... 

Over the past week I've been doing everything in my
power to let you know about Mike Filsaime and Chris
Farrell's success in helping people like you...

After almost 9 months, AffiliateDotCom is open, but
only for a very limited time... 
 
Last time it opened it was available for just a few
days... and why? It sold out that fast. 

Over 1,000 people took the plunge and their success
stories are nothing short of inspiring... 
 
Now it's even better, and it's expected to sell out
just as fast. That's why this will be my last email
to you... I'm expecting a sell out at any time.

It's the real deal. 

No hype. 
 
No push button riches crap.
 
Just a real program with real results...

That said, if you don't want to learn and put in at
least a little effort... this isn't for you.

Don't wait too long though because I can't guarantee
you there will be any spots open if you wait... 

It's decision time...

Thanks & Good Luck,
Gary Ambrose

P.S. I had a few questions about the program, and I
just wanted to clarify the one point I thing seeing 
over, and over, and over again...

You don't have to be techincal to do this... not in 
the slightest. All you need is the ability to learn
and a half-way decent work ethic...

Just take a look, one look, and I know the proof is
going to have you believing what I know is true...

You can do this! But please, don't wait!
