Subject:Try both
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very pretty and responsive. I like sea and sun. I adore just laying under the sun and receive sunbathes.. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my special one. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be ambitious, reliable and with various interests. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://nibinop.tha.im Let's begin our acquaintance
