    						<br>

An Income Tax repayment is a refund of tax that you've overpaid.<br>
HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) has received new information about your taxable income you've overpaid too much tax through your job or pension in previous years.<br<br>

You might have overpaid tax if:<br><br>

    * your employer used the wrong tax code<br>
    * you started a new job and had an emergency tax code for a while<br>
    * you only worked for part of the year<br>
    * you had more than one job at the same time<br>
    * you didn't tell HMRC right away about changes to benefits you got through your work<br>
    * your circumstances changed - perhaps you were made redundant or became self employed and therefore your income reduced<br>
    * other income like investments or rental income reduced but you didn't tell HMRC<br>
    * you made a mistake on your tax return<br>
    * we made a mistake with your tax<br><br>


All of these things and more can mean you paid too much tax.<br>
 HMRC will send you a repayment. You'll get the repayment either by cheque in the post or by bank transfer.<br><br>
