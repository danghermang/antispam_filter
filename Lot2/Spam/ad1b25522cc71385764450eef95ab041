He’s been known to visit with our pages from time to time, preparing for an appearance, lecture, or interview. 
He has even read passages aloud when invited to do so. Not minding, glad to oblige, gracious -- always that, so much so a gent, that’s Ron. But that’s not me. Can’t do it.

Oh, I read and reread what I’ve put down during the keyboard-clacking process of writing a book. Ceaselessly shaping and shading. Striving for the right word in the right place. Wondering what works, what doesn’t, trying very hard to make the concepts Ron and I have developed interesting and inspiring -- thought-connecting, too. Always hoping that it is written well, praying that it is accepted well. Blissfully happy that after so many months that something exists. Mostly terrified that once it’s polished and put out there for public view, that each day that dawns, zero people on planet Earth will care. Just another vestigial waste of pulp, lost on the bookseller’s shelf, gasping for air, of interest to no one. (Pssst! While you snore with happiness, this is the nightmare of all writers, the sort of madness that haunts our dreams the most.)

Closing in, this is not a confidence thing. Hardly. Hold me upside down and give me a good shake and believe me, confidence will pour out of my ears. But still, I pretty much wont begin a page without cursing my lack of talent, or end one successfully dodging my helplessness. Because regardless of what happens later, no matter how much sales are going good, the books booming, pleasing the publisher and giddying those that own their stock, no matter how kind and assuring the plaudits and reviews, I long ago realized something, which in the interest of accuracy, I will share with you now. Shhh .

I could have done better.

This is the torment I keep inside. My inner reality. That the ideas and intellections that were so golden in my mind back when, the thoughts that were winged with such purpose and passion, when they circle and land, becoming ink on paper, in part of my head I know that I could have done, well, just so much better. That’s where my mind goes spinning away to hide when I think about my writing.

Denigrating further, I have no problem sharing with you yet another of my nutball lunacies, which is the fear that many, most, who might turn to our books for guidance, inspiration, or enlightenment would discover the experience to be nothing more than an aberration, and that’s the panic I live with regardless of their praise unending.

So again, since I don’t much care for my writing, I haven't read anything I’ve written. Not after it’s been published. Not once. Not ever. Because even though no one will ever know how hard I slaved, always, always turning in only my best work, wanting whatever I write to have as much quality as possible, I know in my heart of hearts that I could have done better. And how do I deal with such bedeviled expectation? Easy.

As a Zentrepreneur, I not only know that I can always do better -- I believe it. And understand this: Believing is a Zentrepreneur’s most prized possession.

While some live the life they’ve been given, Zentrepreneurs live the life they believe in. 

For that is what Zentrepreneurs are: believers who believe in living a life in which what they do is one with what they are. Pursuing their passion for the possible, perceiving a clarity of purpose, Zentrepreneurs endeavor to study and practice, to live a life where the creative spark, the inner illumination of spirit, talent, and uniqueness, is put into motion, fostering growth that not only enriches their own life, but the lives of others as well. But more than that, Zentrepreneurs have made their lives noble and rich beyond counting by living a dream defined. Exuberantly so. And how do they get to a place of such happiness and light, where they have the courage and commitment to follow their feelings and live a life where they can take charge, create, and do? By simply doing no less than one thing only --
