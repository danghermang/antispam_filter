Kindest Attention.

My names is  Moreno Garcia. I was diagnosed of cancer about 2 years ago, and am receiving treatment for it, but now the doctors are saying I have a short time to live.

When I was in better health, I never really cared for any body with no children of my own and my late wife I was a self centered person. I have decided to donate the sum of $15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million United States Dollars) through you, so you can disburse to charities, widows, orphans and less privileged. I was doing this myself but now my health has deteriorated, I wanted my relatives to do this for me but they only saw it as an opportunity to enrich themselves.

I will be going in for an operation soon, I want this last act of mine to be an offering unto God, perhaps he will have mercy on me. Please contact my lawyer with the details below:

I am sending him a copy of this message as well so he is aware of my intentions.

Please use the funds well and always extend the good works others.

Stay Blessed,

Mr. Moreno Garcia.
