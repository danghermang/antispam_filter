Subject:I-your dream
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very pretty and responsive. 
I am keen on sports. Sports play a very significant role in my life, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be serious, educated and with good sense of humor. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://duwikoc.000space.com Let's start our acquaintance
