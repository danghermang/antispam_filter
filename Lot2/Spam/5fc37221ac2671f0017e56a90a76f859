Subject:I had a dream - you
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and romantic. I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, educated and with various interests. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://zaqipize.everything-fine.info Let's start our acquaintance
