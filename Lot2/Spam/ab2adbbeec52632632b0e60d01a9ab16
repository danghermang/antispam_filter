Subject:You believe in my love
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very pretty and romantic. 
I enjoy simple things. I am very good at cooking and drawing.. It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be positive, reliable and with good sense of humor. I want to love and to be loved http://dagicido.skysols.in If you want to know me better
