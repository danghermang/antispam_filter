Subject:My darling, answer
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very kind and generous. I am keen on sports. Sports play a very significant role in my life, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. 
It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be ambitious, educated and with good sense of humor. 
I want to love and to be loved http://sakosiwa.thport.com Let's begin our acquaintance
