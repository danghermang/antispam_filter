ATTN SIR,
My name isRICH OWEN, I am a citizen of Sweden and the
 Executive Director of Trident Corporation, a multi-national oil corporation
 operating from London-England, UK. I am seeking your assistance to retrieve the sum of Fifteen Million Dollars consisting of two consignment boxes.
 This money was acquired from the company and it was
 accompanied by a diplomat to the U.S.A, my reason for this is because I have been cheated out of my entitlements by the company for too long simply because I
 am not a British. The contact details of the diplomat will be given to you if you
 indicate your interest to help me.
 Each of the boxes contains $7.5M and for your help I am
 ready to release 30% to you, for security reasons the consignment was registered to be CONFIDENTIAL DIPLOMATIC DOCUMENTS and I can explain why it was declared so. Bear in mind that the diplomat is not aware of the content of the consignment, it has been there for the past 1 month as I'm looking for a reliable partner.
 I will be leaving the country immediately the consignment
 is delivered to you for my private investment and I have vowed never to step
 back into London,England. Please, I need your urgent response before my
 plans to leave the company is discovered.Right now the safest form of correspondence is through my
 own e-mail address,please in the interest of confidentiality only reply
 through my direct email address.
 Reply along with your personal telephone and fax number
 where I can reach you.Please if you are not willing and interested in helping me
 kindly delete this email from your computer and pretend you never got it.
