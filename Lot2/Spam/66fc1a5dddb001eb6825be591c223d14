Compliments of the day,

Suppiah & Co. Solicitors is a legal consulting firm specializing in international business search

A client of mine name withheld for security reasons until full acknowledgment received from you,

direct supervision.

She wishes to make this investment discreetly under discretionary asset Management placement, in 
the areas of Agriculture, Education, Real estate, transport, Oil, Gas and other viable venture(s) 
which you might recommend. 

I contacted you on the consideration that I could discuss with you on the possibility of my client 
placing this fund in your care for management as a partner either in your existing establishment or 
other venture to be undertaken upon agreed percentage before her arrival. 

She Prefers that this investment be built on transparent atmosphere where legal service will be 
involved in other to build mutual trust and understanding.

I have therefore been directed to investigate whether you would agree to act as a foreign agent 
in order to update this transaction. If you can handle this, then you are to declare your interest.
