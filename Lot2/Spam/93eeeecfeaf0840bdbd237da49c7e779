> Not all that long ago in our regularly

> q and a session we discussed the proper

> your home business. Make no mistake
> blogging is extremely powerful as a
> business building tool "if" used
> properly, here's how to do it
> right . . .
>
> One of the biggest mistake I see people
> making in their blogging efforts is
> "why" they use them. Most people tend to
> think of blogging as a primary traffic
> generation strategy, and it can be, but
> it's not THE best use of a blog in our

>
> You should think of blog traffic more
> like icing on the cake. The primary and
> MOST powerful use of starting and using
> a blog in your business is it's ability
> to create a powerful testimonial for
> you. Let me explain . . .
>
> When I started my first successful
> business here's exactly what I did. On
> an almost daily basis I blogged about
> something relating to my business, at
> the top of that blog I would always note
> the number of people in our team, and
> then carry on with the message.
>
> Sometimes if I had new recruits I would
> create a formal blog welcome to my new
> team mates by listing their names and
> welcoming them to the team.
>
> If there was a co-op, advertising
> strategy that was working well for me,
> you better bet I put in on that blog.
>
> Why? Well, I haven't told you how I used
> my blog to recruit yet (we'll get to
> that in a second), but along with using
> a blog to recruit I also constantly
> referred my team members there for any
> and all updates on our business.
>
> It was a central meeting point. As a
> result my team always checked the blog
> to see what was going on in our
> business. This was important for two
> reasons:
>
> First, easy access to important current
> information pertaining to our team, and
> second as team wide social proof.
>
> They came to the blog and saw the number
> of people on the team growing and
> welcome messages to our new team members
> and subconsciously it helped raise their
> belief level about the business they
> were in.
>
> It's sometimes easy for a new recruit to
> get discouraged without encouragement
> and the blog helped give them that
> encouragement they needed. As a result
> they "believed" in the business, and
> took more proactive action to go out and
> do what we were doing to grow which
> translated into a higher rate of
> duplication in the business and longer
> retention.
>
> So let's recap so far, we've got a blog
> where we're blogging about our team,
> what we're doing to advertise, we're
> "training" our team members to check the
> blog often for advice and encouragement
> and as a result their using that
> motivation to go out and build. This
> causes the team to grow faster,
> stronger, and better.
>
> What do we have? That sounds like a
> pretty darn powerful testimonial to me.
> And that's the primary use of the blog
> as far as recruiting is concerned as I
> mentioned earlier.
>
> The mistake most people make is they
> want to blog for traffic, which you can
> do, and I'll share a few tips to doing
> that better in a few, but not it's best
> use for recruiting. Here's how to use
> your blog to recruit . . .
>
> I'd generate leads directly to my own
> lead capture page or my company's lead
> capture page. Once I saw my lead opt in
> I would send them a personal email to
> tell them a little bit about myself, our
> team, and our business. In that email I
> would always include a link to my blog
> so my prospects could get an inside look
> at who I and our team was doing.
>
> This is powerful as heck for a couple
> reasons where recruiting is concerned.
>
> First, people are inherently
> voyeuristic. They wanna spy, so let
> them. By sending my prospects to my blog
> they now had the opportunity to get to
> know me and my team without me even
> being there. As a result, when we did
> have an email correspondence or they
> called me they already knew me.
>
> I've always found this to be a MUCH
> better option than cold calling leads. I
> let them get to know me first.
>
> Second reason this is powerful is based
> on a principle called "The Power Of
> Documentation" which states we as humans
> tend to take things which we read as
> more truthful than things we just hear.
>
> In other words, a prospect who goes to
> your blog and reads about you and your
> team is going to take what they read
> there at face value where if you're on
> the phone telling them the same thing
> they're most likely saying "Yeah right"
>
> If you've ever called leads and had that
> question come up of "Well why should I
> join you?" Having and sending your
> prospects to your blog first will
> virtually eliminate this objection and
> ignite powerful curiosity and intrigue
> about you and what you do.
>
> So, when it comes to using a blog to
> recruit, it's best us is as a secondary
> traffic strategy. You get the lead, then
> you send them to your blog for a
> powerful testimonial.
>
> So I can hear the question welling up
> "What should I put on my blog to start?"
> Simple, talk about yourself, your
> company's products and service, why you
> love your company, your team, AND here's
> a key . . .
>
> Ask your upline or downline to write you
> a quick note about why it's great to
> work with you and put it on your blog.
>
> You do that, and you've covered all your
> bases. Not only are your prospects
> learning about you, why you like what
> you do, your personality, your team, BUT
> they're also SEEING other people saying
> great things about you. Third party
> validation about you is a powerful
> thing.
>
> Simply doing this and nothing else, I
> was surprised to see that after about
> six months of consistent blogging my
> blog received about 300 site views per
> day from people finding online via
> search engines. I did nothing but blog,
> but just because I had content on the
> blog I had tons of people finding it for
> free, and as a result, calls out of the
> blue from people saying "yeah I found
> your blog, what's up with your business"
> (kinda cool)
>
> So let me share a few things you can do
> to improve you search engine rankings
> for you blog posts to enhance your free
> traffic.
>
> First, do a little keyword research
> using the Google Keyword tool. Find a
> few keywords related to business and use
> those keywords in your blog title, and a
> few times, along with a few synonyms for
> that main keyword in your blog post.
>
> One secret strategy that's really
> increased my blog traffic personally is
> using images in my blog.
>
> On blog posts where I insert an image to
> correspond to the blog post keyword I
> tend to get about double the traffic. So
> find a few images related to your blog
> post keyword.
>
> Name those images as your main keyword,
> for instance if my blog post was based
> on the keyword "internet network
> marketing" then then I would find 3
> images I could use for that keyword and
> I would name the images:
>
> internet-network-marketing1.jpg,
> internet-network-marketing2.jpg,
> internet-network-marketing3.jpg
> etc.
>
> Search engines rank you based on how
> many other websites link to your post
> related to your keywords, so when you
> create a new blog post, write an article
> with the same keyword and submit it to
> the major article directories with a
> link going back to your main blog post.
>
> Find a few other blogs in the niche and
> comment on a few post and link back to
> your blog post.
>
> Create a facebook, twitter, myspace,
> squidoo account and post some content
> based on the keyword and link those back
> to your blog post.
>
> You do that for you blog and you're
> ahead of 99% of marketers.
>
> So now that we've got traffic down,
> let's talk about $$$, how do you make
> money with your blog? I think the
> simplest way to make money with blog
> from the outset is to simply add Google
> Adsense to each blog post, not so much
> because you'll make a ton of cash from
> it, but when people do click on your
> Google Adsense ads on your blog you'll
> make a few bucks which is powerful
> positive reinforcement for your efforts
> in the early going.
>
> It'll fuel you forward. You'll see money
> coming in and you'll get excited.
>
> The best long term way to make money
> with your blog though is . . .
>
> Integrating your blog with your email
> marketing efforts. I love using the one
> two punch of email marketing and
> blogging because it allows you to change
> the dynamic of your email messages to
> your prospects from a one way
> conversation to a two way conversation
> by giving your prospects the ability to
> comment back to you.
>
> Getting people involved and commenting
> on your blog is a powerful way to build
> trust. Think of your blog as a
> conversation and you'll see the bond
> between you and your prospects growing
> stronger daily and for it your income
> will increase.
>
> There are two powerful benefits of
> turning your emails into a blog
> conversation.
>
> The first is simply when people get
> involved and proactively comment they've
> taking a powerful step into your world.
> The second benefit is a little more
> sneaky, but extremely powerful.
>
> Say you send a prospect to your blog to
> share an important post today and 15
> people comment on that post. Great!
>
> Well what if you take the email that you
> sent people to your blog and add it to
> your auto responder?
>
> Now the leads that join your list 3
> months from now will get that email
> automatically via your autoresponder
> email sequence you set up and when they
> get to the post not only are they going
> to get to participate in a conversation
> you set up on autopilot, but they'll
> also see all the people that commented
> prior and say . . .
>
> "Wow! I just got this email and 15
> people already comment there must be a
> lot of people listening in." and hence
> conclude you're a good teacher and
> someone a LOT of people listen to.
>
> So there's more I could go into on
