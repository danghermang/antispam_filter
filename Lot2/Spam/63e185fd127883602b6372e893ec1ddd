Back from hospital with that tell-tale tingling in my finger tips, and a pump with 5fu around my waist.

Some of the ant-nausea pills they give me are steroids, with a tendency to change mood for the better, but they also give me a sedative in the pump, with the result that I feel on top form, but my memory isn't good and I'm a bit clumsy. I might well forget to type some of what I have been planning to say.

No wonder they don't want me to drive to and from treatment.

Talked about side effects and bloods. The only thing I learned about the bloods is that the white cell count is fine, probably because that was the only question I had planned.

As a result of talking about the dip I had around the end of week one, they have extended my use of dexamthasone (anti-nausea steroid) while at the same time tapering it off.

Now 4 on morning of treatment next time, but for the next few days I have 2 twice a day for 3 days, 1 twice a day for 2 days then one daily for 2 days. Then stop until morning of next dose. It will be interesting to see if that makes me feel better early next week than I felt early last week. I'll be taking them with breakfast and lunch, then with breakfast only, because they apparently have a tendency to mess up sleep patterns, especially taken late in the day.

Felt quite tired climbing up my 64 stairs on my return, and now feel like a little doze, though to try to keep my sleep pattern steady I won't give into it unless I get very tired.

I think that is just about it. Nothing to terrify those advised to follow the same path.

DavidA couple more notes this morning.

One being that the pattern of a very sleepless night from the first time continued. No sleep after 3 - not unpleasant, though, thanks to having tablet - little computer that is, not another pill. Keeping up with boards, some reading, some youtube vids. Up now, feeling a little tired, but not sleepy. Fortunately on sick, so when I do find sleepiness creeping in, I can just surrender to it.

I blame the anti-nausea steroids - maybe I'll talk to the hospital staff more about them next time, but since I don't and haven't yet felt at all sick on this cycle I might well decide that they are the lesser of evils.

The weather here is colder today, and since my only heated room in the flat is living room/kitchen I had my worst experience yet of breathlessness when I went to do my ablutions. Following the written instructions I took some deep breaths through nose, which helped, and in the living room I feel fine. It is a nice day today, clear and sunny if cold - by our standards anyway. 7C according to the BBC at the mo. So I'd like to go and take a load of wildlife photos. I think I might still be too tired/drugged up to drive, but there are places within a few hundred yards of home on foot. If the breath and tingling get too much, though, I might be reduced to taking pics out of my window. Which, though I say it myself, gives me a wonderful view. But I'm going to give going out with camera and binoculars a go. I have gloves with open fingers, which I can use for focussing and taking photos, but will be careful to let fingers out of the finger hole as little as possible. Maybe a couple 
 of degrees more warmth as the sun gets to work will make the crucial difference - hope so.

I am finding keeping clean a bit difficult - I'm borrowing a friend's shower a couple of times a week, since mine doesn't work well, and I find it impossible to get the elasticated sleeve over the picc line by myself with just left hand.

So washing as well as I can in bathroom, without getting into bath. Hot water is fine, but sometimes I found myself touching cold porcelain, and that really set the tingling off, though it's not bad now.

Can't think of anything else - now cooking porridge calls.

DavidDavid- mom has alot of trouble sleeping -always after treatments but she does all the time- so yeah she gets her 8hours- in small increments and whenever her body says so. anytime anywhere. the couch has become her best buddy.
maybe you can take some pocket warmers with you..does the heat bother you too? it only bothered mom in food but she walks around with a hot water bottle. good luck with your photos- wildlife is beautiful...David- mom has alot of trouble sleeping -always after treatments but she does all the time- so yeah she gets her 8hours- in small increments and whenever her body says so. anytime anywhere. the couch has become her best buddy.
