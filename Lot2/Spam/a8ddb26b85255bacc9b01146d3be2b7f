Ahh its nice I can post without registering. I've had some very similar problems to you guys. I've been looking on the internet for a while now for some information and until now didn't find any real answers. I just noticed this thread went on for 23 pages. 

So, like many lof you I've also had problems with frequent urination and also some incontinence - sometimes I can hold on and eventually a little leaks, sometimes I get no warning whatsoever and a bit comes out. Very annoying. I've seen the doctor he didn't think much of it. I'm getting blood test results back on wed tho, so we'll see. 

So it started for me a couple of years ago as needing to urinate more frequently after excessive masturbation. I found laying off the masturbation made the problem go away, but in time it has continued to return each time I did the same thing. Just recently I've found its gotten worse. No urinary tract infection, doubt its BHP (enlarged prostate) (as I'm 27) and I hope its not prostate cancer. 

I'll have a good read through this entire thread and let you know how I get on. In the meantime, I'm strictly limiting masturbation/sex to a couple of times a week.seen i could post with out registering so i fiqured i would ask a question. what is the worst its ever been for some of you guys. tonight i helped my brother n law fix his wifes truck. everything was going good (no urge) so we were going to go to the bar. unfortunitly on the way home it started up. i swear it felt like i completly peed myself. so much so that i could even feel a sense of wetness on my right foot. so embarased as i was i told my bro i couldnt go to the bar instead i came home and got straight in the shower as that tends to help me alot. but the feeling has yet to go away. even now as i am typing this out i can feel it slipping out but theres nothing there. my foot even keeps getting warm were i felt the wet sensation earlier. this really sucks im 21 years old been dealing with this for three years n
 ow. started off as a feeling like somebody was squeezing every bit of juice they could possibly get out of my right nut. every day at work i would fall to the ground in such aganizing pain afraid my boss or worse my grandmother would come back there and find me on the ground crying. i have since quit my job and even quit going to school because i can not run from this problem. i do how ever believe that my nervs are involved as when i am busy doing something i wont have much problems so i took a zanex going to see if that helps me calm down. so far no go (3 hrs).Honestly man, I don't know if I can say its ever been so bad for that I'd fallen on the ground in agonizing pain. That sounds very serious. On my worst days my symptoms are I have to pee every 5 to 10 mins and every time I do I never feel empty. In fact if I stand there and strain I keep getting more urine out little by little until I get to the point that I just give up and try to hold it as long as I can until the 
 next time I go. As far as pain goes, I've had urethra pain. Not like a burning, but more like a dull pain. I've also experienced pain in my abdomen and lower back and groin. Also not burning pain, but dull. Sometimes I think though that the pain is caused by me straining so much to push more urine out on the really bad days. I also notice that if I am not frequent in bowel movements that it makes a significant difference on the type of day I will have. I've never experienced the sensation either of urinating myself. It's always a sensation of having to go urinate, even if barely any comes out. If you have not seen a doctor or medical advice I would definitely urge you to do so. I'm not trying to scare you but your symptoms just seem to be worse and different than a lot of us on here. I'm not trying to speak for everybody else, just off what I've heard and gathered from others on here. Please though, if you haven't seen a doctor do so. Even if you're embarrassed it has to be 
 done. To me that sounds like you could have an infection or something in your prostate, bladder or surrounding areas. Also you may want to look into a condition called internal cystitis. Good luck to you man and please keep us informed.Dude! Same thing happened to me when I caved- it came out way easier than usual AND watery, I'd even say in a bigger quantity. I guess that's what happens to old semen? Anyway, I'm proud to say I'm on day 8 of abstinence and it isn't nearly as bad as it once was, thank goodness. I no longer feel the urge as bad as before, but that doesn't mean it's not there. I think I said it and I will say it again- don't feel like all your progress is lost if you masturbate! I've found that, while masturbation doesn't help in the least, it didn't make it worse the last time I caved. It should still be restricted, though, so as not to irritate the nerves. But I haven't gotten ***** in many days now because I've been practicing a very positive attitude toward
 s this mess thanks to all you guys' info over the months and to divert my sexual energy into more positive avenues, like exercise.. I believe that this is 100% surmountable with the right attitude. I've never really had an addiction in my life, but masturbation sure seems like one since it constantly barks at you to do it, but your mind's gotta be stronger than the pain for you to overcome this. I believe in you guys!

And remember- caving in doesn't make you a failure. If you have a positive attitude to accept mistakes and cognitively try harder and search for ways to put your energy into something else, this can be done well. I've caved in at least five times now and it made it worse the first few times, but I'm much better now. It's kind of weened me off jerking off to do it every week or so. I feel stronger and more confident to get rid of this
