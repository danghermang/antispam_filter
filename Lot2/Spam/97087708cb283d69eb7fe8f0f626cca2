Hi Riders,

I know the 4 Day is a few months away yet but Accommodation is filling
fast ...

There is no Camping at the Parc Ferme but the following are only a
couple of K's from the event ..

It is Rainbow Caravan Park and can be contacted on 08 9729 2239. 
 
There is also a park just north of town (Lake Brockman Tourist Park)
which is a really great location.

I sugest you get a booking in Quick .....

Regards
C.Gray
