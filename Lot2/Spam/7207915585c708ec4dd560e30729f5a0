user</font>,<br>
In addition to our other ways of preventing, detecting, and resolving fraud, we 
offer Verified by Visa, a free, simple-to-use and free service that confirms 
your identity with an extra password when you make an online transaction.<br>
Since <font color="#FF0000">6/06/2011</font> we require all our customers to 
enroll their visa cards in the Verified by Visa program. If you do not do so you 
will not be able to shop online with your visa card.<br>
This is a reminder to activate the Verified by Visa feature for your card as 
soon as possible.<br>
