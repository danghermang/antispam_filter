Subject:How so?
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very beautiful and responsive. 
I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be serious, reliable and with good sense of humor. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://guduteci.freehostnet.info Let's start our acquaintance
