Subject:You groom? I groom
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever lady, also I am  very pretty and generous. 
I am keen on sports. Sports is very important to me, and I am sure that "the sound mind is in a sound body“. 
It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be serious, reliable and with good sense of humor. 

And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://miriciv.enterneted.com Let's begin our acquaintance
