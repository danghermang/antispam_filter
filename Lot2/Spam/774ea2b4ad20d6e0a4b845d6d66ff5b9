Subject:Hey... Over Here!
Hello, my dear friend

I am here to tell you truth, although I don't know who you are. I have everything for happiness in my life: family, a good work, friends. But I am not happy, because I am very lonely. I miss the one thing, which will makes me happy- love. What is it? Why people look for it  for many years? Somebody finds it very fast, somebody can't find it, but doesn't give up and look for it again and again. I am a woman who doesn't give up and I look for my love for many years.My letter is a little ship which is swimming to you in this Big sea of Life. I hope that it will reach you and you won't leave me without reply http://andiloveyoutoo.com/hope
If you want to be beloved and  happy, I will give everything to you, because I miss love badly too.

Waiting for your answer

Dian A
