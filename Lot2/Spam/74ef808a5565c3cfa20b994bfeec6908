Subject:Facebook 'loophole' pays $35K/month?
DISCLAIMER AT THE BOTTOM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Man, this is just plain WEIRD.

My friend Mark discovered a 'loophole' in Facebook,
that ACCIDENTALLY made him over $35,000 last month.

This 'technical glitch' allows you to log into
your Facebook account... set-up a special type of
'Fan' page... and promote affiliate links to tens
of thousands of interested people, at the click of
a button.

It's so easy, that Mark has VERIFIED testimonials
from more than 30 people who've never made a
dime online before... who are now making between
$1,500 and $25,000 per month EACH, by simply logging
into their Facebook accounts and clicking buttons.

I have no idea how long this 'glitch' will
remain open -- or if FB's programmers are trying
to fix it.  In the meantime, there's literally
MILLIONS of dollars being siphoned from it daily!

Get in before they close the loophole, at

All the best,
