Subject:I've always been fortunate
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I find myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very beautiful and generous. 

I adore kids, and I feel that it is time to have my own children.. It seems to be banal to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 
I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be positive, communicative and with good sense of humor. 
And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://ceilpswz.5ballov.ru Let's start our acquaintance
