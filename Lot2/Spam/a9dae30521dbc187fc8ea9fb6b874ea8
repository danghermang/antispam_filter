Subject:Taming the shrewed
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very beautiful and responsive. I always try to keep myself in a good shape.. 
It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be serious, educated and very attentive. 
I want to love and to be loved http://minizuhi.ckfreehost.com If you want to know me better
