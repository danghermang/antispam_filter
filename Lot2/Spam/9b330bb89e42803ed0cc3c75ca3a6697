Hello Dear,

I am writing you from Heir Hunters Company in the United kingdom .

Heir Hunters probate detectives looking for distant relatives of people who have died without making a will,

the United Kingdom  government last year made over ?18m from uncliamed assets.

When people die intestate ( without a will ) and with no known relatives, their names are released by the Treasury.

Every Thursday, a list of these unclaimed estates, the Bona Vacantia ( Latin for "ownerless goods" ) is published on the Treasury Solicitor's website.

The race is then on for heir locators to track down the often distant relatives in line for a windfall. Often heir hunters pick more unusual names first, as they are easier to trace.

We came across your profile and email while searching  through genealogy database,we will be glad if you can get back to us with your full name, date of birth,
