Subject:Attention Beneficiary !!!
My Name is Mr.Jerry Howard.I am the auditor and head of computing department of HSBC Bank London, London WC2N 4,here in United Kingdom.

There is an account opened in this bank in 2003 and since my inception into office on 2nd Jan 2010, I then found this account and when I investigated deeply by contacting the assigned next of kin I also found that the next of kin to this account was an Indonesia who lived in London for over 63Yrs and nobody has operated on this account again after 2003.

I took the courage to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important transaction. In order to transfer out $90,000,000 (Ninety Million U.S Dollars after going through some old files, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently,it will be forfeited for nothing and HSBC Bank London management might divert the funds to their own accounts.

Please respond immediately I will use my position and influence to effect the legal approval and onward transfer of this fund into your account with appropriate clearance from foreign payment department.You will stand to get 40% while 60% will be for me. Kindly quote the reference (acct)numbers above when responding to this mail.

I will fill you in with further details upon your reply .You can call me directly on this private telephone number so that we can discuss more on how to transfer this funds to your designated account in your country .Tel:+ 44 77 000 17703


Sincerely yours,
Jerry Howard.
