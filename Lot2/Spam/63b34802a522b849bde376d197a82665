Subject:PayPal is going to regret this... 
Hey,

PayPal told one of their top developers that he had
to be "let go" recently... now he's speaking out!

He worked for PayPal since the beginning, in one of
their most notorious, and most hated departments... 

His job was to freeze, limit and close the accounts
that PayPal deemed "risky"... in other words, these
were the accounts that were making the most, in the
shortest amount of time... 

He watched these accounts, he knew how these PayPal
account holders were making their money... and, why
it was coming in so fast!

PayPal didn't like seeing tens of thousands pouring
into new accounts... they considered it too "risky"
for their tastes...

But Steven loved it. He knew these accounts weren't 
doing anything "risky"...they were just bringing in
way more money, in a lot less time, than the PayPal
"security" team believed was should be possible.

Today Steven is going public, and sharing how these 
accounts were making so much money, so quickly that 
PayPal thought they were doing something illegal...

Thanks & Good Luck,
Gary Ambrose

P.S. Steven's department found where these accounts
were getting their traffic... that was their job! 

And yes, he's going to tell you what they found...
