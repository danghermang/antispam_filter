Subject:Re: ONCE I CONFIRM
Greetings to you!

Before I continue, let me introduce myself to you, I am Capt. Robert Miller, the commander of the Special NATO coalition force with the United Nation troops in Afghanistan. My country is Germany. I have now in my possession the sum of sixteen million united states dollars($16M) which I recovered from one of our raids here in Afghanistan.

This box of money has been deposited with the Red Cross here in Kabul as a diplomatic luggage for safe keep and to make contacts for its proper use. As the team leader, it is under my power to approve whoever comes forth for this money.

So I need someone I can deal with on trust and that is why I contacted you. As soon as I get your response, I will put you forward as the owner of the money and then move the money to you. As  a military personnel, I cannot parade such an amount or carry it to my country so I need to present somene as the beneficiary. I just need your acceptance and all is done. I have a 100% authentic means of moving the money through diplomatic means to you.

Once I confirm your interest and your positive reply, I will proceed to register your name as the beneficiary/owner of the luggage. This money is my life and I am willing to give you 30% of the total sum when the money is delivered to you. I wait your response so we can proceed immediately. In less than five(5) days the money should be in your safe custody.

The only telephone access we have is radio message which is for our general use and is being monitored. Therefore all communication will be via email until we finish our assignment here and fly straight to your country to meet you.

Regards,

Capt. Robert Miller
