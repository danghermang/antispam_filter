<!-- The UN has warned the disease has the potential to become a pandemic, =
but said the world is better prepared than ever to deal with the threat. St=
ocks of anti-viral medicines are being readied and travellers are being scr=
eened at some airports for symptoms. Mexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Co=
rdova said suspected swine flu cases in his country had risen to 1,614 incl=
uding 103 deaths. Of those, 20 deaths are confirmed to have been caused by =
the new virus and tests are being investigated. The US, where 20 people are=
 confirmed to have caught the virus, has declared a public health emergency=
=2E There are also confirmed cases in Canada, and investigations are being ca=
rried out on suspected cases in Spain, Israel and New Zealand. In most case=
s outside Mexico, people have been only mildly ill and have made a full rec=
overy. The World Health Organization (WHO), the UN's health agency, has sai=
d the swine flu virus could be capable of mutating into a more dangerous st=
rain.But officials say they need more information on the virus before decid=
ing whether to raise the global pandemic alert phase. The WHO is advising a=
ll countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia-like sy=
mptoms among their populations - particularly among young healthy adults, a=
 characteristic of past pandemics. Only a handful of the Mexican cases have=
 so far been laboratory-confirmed as swine flu, while in the US confirmed c=
ases had only mild symptoms. Health experts want to know why some people be=
come so seriously ill, while others just develop a cold, the BBC's Imogen F=
oulkes reports from Switzerland. Dr Keiji Fukuda, WHO's assistant director-=
general in charge of health security, said all countries were looking at th=
e situation seriously but that a true picture of the extent of the virus wa=
s still emerging. H1N1 is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreak=
s in humans but the newly detected version contains genetic material from v=
ersions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds. It is spread mainly thr=
ough coughs and sneezes. Officials said most of those killed so far in Mexi=
co were young adults - rather than more vulnerable children and the elderly=
=2E There is currently no vaccine for the new strain of flu but severe cases =
can be treated with antiviral medication. Dr Fukuda said years of preparing=
 for bird flu had boosted world stocks of antivirals. It is unclear how eff=
ective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection aga=
inst the new strain, as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains. =
WHO experts will meet again in Geneva on Tuesday to discuss whether to rais=
e the pandemic alert phase.I do fear that we will have deaths, Dr Anne Schu=
chat of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told report=
ers. The Canadian cases were recorded at opposite ends of the country: two =
in British Columbia in the west, and four in the Atlantic province of Nova =
Scotia. Several countries in Asia and Latin America have begun screening ai=
rport passengers for symptoms. -->
