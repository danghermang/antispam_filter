Subject:Relationship
I do not know what to start with that’s why I will start with the description of my character. 
I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very beautiful and generous. I fond of outdoor sports special cycling and skiing.. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. 

I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my other half. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is not everything. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be ambitious, educated and with various interests. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://hknquyb.5ballov.ru Let's start our acquaintance
