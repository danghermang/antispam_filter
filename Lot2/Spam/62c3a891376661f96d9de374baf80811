Subject:Contact DHL Courier Delivery Company
Hello My Dear: Greeting to you & your familiy,

I have been waiting for you since then to come down here and pick your outstanding payment left but I did not hear from you since that time as we fixed. Then I went and deposited the $2.8M US Dollars. I lodged the funds inside a Copper box as Consignment Box with DHL COURIER DELIVERY SERVICE in Benin because I traveled to China to visit my friend for the Company's Annual Board meeting. I will not come back till next month end. Please note that I did not disclose to the Courier that the content of the Consignment box is cash money, instead I registered the consignment as containing some pieces of Art work, this was for security reason and to ensure that the Consigned fund reached you safely.

I want You to contact the DHL COURIER DELIVERY SERVICE to know when they will deliver your package(fund).I have paid for the delivering charges except the security keeping fee which they said it can only be paid when the Deposits is ready for shipment to the Receiver. Therefore, The only money you have to send to them is the security keeping fee which is $115 Us Dollars to receive your package at your nominated address.

So be advised to contact the Courier Director through this below details and reconfirm to them the information and address where to send the Package to you.
