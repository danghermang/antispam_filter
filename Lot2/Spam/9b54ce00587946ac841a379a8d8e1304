<h1 style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:blue;">You don't need drugs to treat and control your blood pressure. Putting that kind of stress on your body by taking in a handful of expensive chemicals that counter the side effects of the others is just ridiculous! Even if they were effective, they open you up to a whole list of additional side effects! Does it make sense to chemically alter your body like that?

Back in 1900, they didn't know any better...today, we do know better. Why repeat the patterns of the past and expect different results? Isn't that the definition of insanity?

geeze I was typing and my computer just flipped out and deleted my post???? any way thanks for the reply Topazil, and relieved(not glad) to hear you had similar ecxperiences Yes we are as you put it a very grounded family which I am proud to be a part of and feel very fortunate and blessed. Doesnt matter what the belief of anyone is as long as it involves love and family and a trust in a higher power-is the way I feel. and.....as far as adopting??? the more the merrier- even bigger grin than yours . I dont have a sister or a daughter. Just a sister in law and a female fur-kid. soo off topic too much and back to mom-her food passes through way too quickly like every 3 hours and all through the nite- which if she doesnt pay strict attention it will be all over her.  I feel so bad but theres nothing I can do to help with that. shes drinking packets of questrian every day and taking lomotil every 6 hours and immodium evety 4 hours -24-7 including bannanas rices toast ? shes not f
 ond of applesauce but eats apples.she has lost 8 pounds in the last 6 weeks-shes eating altho not as much as I would like her to but adequatly(sp?)
but its hard to eat when everything taste like chemicals. or burns your mouth or nauseates you. she also has to watch what she consumes because too much gas makes the bag come away from her body. she had some stuffed peppers from her garden in the freezer so she made them for dinner-with sides. me and my sisterinlaw finished up when we got there so she could lie down. so it all works out.-Its just depressing to see anyone go through this-but if theres no choice we gotta do the best we can and as long as she wants us to fight with her-she has her troops on her side well mom was upset with our Easter holiday comming up and she feels too weak to make her candy ,Traditional bread and couldnt go to church to get her palm. So I attempted to make the bread and was going to surprise her1-it doesnt look like hers,but it taste like it soo I was happy   just need some practice. so I called her to give her the good news soon as it came out of the oven and......she was taking hers out of 
 the oven at the same time  go figure-she talked ny brother into helping her. sooo now we have the most Easter bread we ever had as opposed to not haveing any at all for the first time ever. (kindof neat we were actually baking it at the same exact time and both had no clue )
and my husbands secretary got mom her blessed palm  just wish she felt better Ihate to see her losing soo much weight this month being scared depressed anworried, and looking so wiped out. But we are celebrating over her house and Im bringing the raviolis(another tradition)..It will be great if she can just eat with us.would love to get some pictures of us together but she wont let me,so while Im talking about it for all who celebrate this sacred event Happy Easter!  a bit early wish but I dont want to forget. thoughts and prayers to the forum and all who read moms story. Thank you for allowing us that look into your family's life and yes that was so cool that you were baking the bread at the same time (grins) 

May your family have a blessed Easter and may your mother's side effects lessen or ease all together during this time that she might enjoy to the fullest the family about her, the day itself and the meaning of such and the wonderful food.

(((((((((((((((((((hugs))))))))))))))))Bruce-thanks for the hopefull thoughts  made me feel a bit better tonight -I usually call her 3 times a day but today she didnt feel well enough to talk this morning and this afternoon she was napping and her phone was tied up from 7-? I usually wont call her past 9pm but I tried every 15 min till 10-I gave up for the nite cant call her any later and hopefully she was on the phone with one of her sisters from Arizona.(they can talk especially now they all have differnt problems. and they are only a couple years apart in age,)
I also tried her cell phone but its turned off.
Ill give her a call in the morning hope she gets some much needed rest tonight. thanks for being there for me and mom  her bloodwork came back and they told her to hold off on the coumadin till next bloodwork. prayers for the forum tonight .and for as many as possible to wake up and feel even a smidge better.mom scared me today- first off I couldnt get ahold of her all evening (found out later they were having phone problems) , the this morning she went with my other brother and his wife to have her bloodwork done.
I called at 1 still no answer then at three and she got on the phone apologizing to me and said she couldnt answer the phone she took a nap after she got home and when she stood up she almost passed out. she sounded horrible on the phone losing her voice, out of breath and very weak. I was ready to run over -she said she would be ok. so I kept her on the phone for awhile untill I was conviced she was telling the truth(because no-ones there with her till my younger brother gets back from work and his hours vary extremely. I called her again just now shes very weak and just got done talking to her one sister in Arizona . All she had t eat today was 1/2 cup of broccoli soup. shes going to take another nap. The doctor called -she is to stay off the coumadin till Mon or Tues and if shes still this weak she has to go in for a nutition drip. Ill check on her about 8pm tonight in the meantime my brother should have come home. Im hoping he will not go out again tonight.. She doesnt wa
 nt me to go there and she doesnt want to come here  but it could have been worse -she promised if she got that pass out feeling aain she will call. trying to hang in here
