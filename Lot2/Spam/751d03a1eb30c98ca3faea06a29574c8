Hi glenn,

Since I  launched Guitar Alliance over 10 years ago (where has
the time gone?) it has continued to be the choice destination of
millions of guitar players through the years.

Now, I’ve created a brand new course that hits close to home. 
It’s called “Blues Improvisation”. This course will show you how
to do the thing that I love most:

"How To improvise your own killer blues leads on the fly."

Blues Improvisation is a 60 lesson course that will turn you into 
a blues improvising monster

The lessons include HD video, guitar tab downloads, and jam
track downloads. I’ll provide you with everything you need to 
succeed. Plus, if you run into any problems with the course, just 
let me know and I’ll show you the way. I offer great customer 
support and will respond to your inquiries on a timely basis.

Don’t worry, you can learn at your own pace, because you’ll 
have lifetime access to all the course materials (which includes
videos, tab downloads, and jam tracks).

It doesn’t matter if you can’t play a lick- this course is for all
beginner to intermediate guitar players.

With the new Blues Improvisation course:

-You’ll learn all the important blues scales

-You’ll become a master of popular blues techniques such
 as bends and vibrato

-You’ll have the ability to improvise anywhere- anytime!

Anyone can learn to play the blues. Why not you, too? I’ll take 
you step-by-step. All you have to do is commit to the 60 days of 
lessons- and with 60 lessons you’ll have plenty of time to dive
deep into the world of blues improvisation. You’ll have a deeper 
understanding of blues guitar and you’ll possess an improved 
blues guitar skill set.

Sign up for my Blues Improvisation course today for half-off the
standard price of 49.00 USD. You’ll pay only 24.50 for lifetime
access to the entire course. That’s 60 lessons for about the
 price of 2 or 3  lessons with a private instructor- it’s a no brainer!

100% Money Back Guarantee

Try the course for 60 days. If  you are not satisfied with your
results, just let me know. I’ll cheerfully refund 100% of your 
investment in the course.

Just click the link below to sign up today and get started 
immediately:
