Subject:Why do you keep doing this? Yes you, Pirmas....
Hey,

I'm frustrated, and you may be the one to blame... 

And yes, I'm taking about you, Pirmas.

Let me explain...

It seems like there's more and more garbage type
products being released every day... all of them
promising instant traffic, instant websites, and
money with a few clicks of your mouse. 

And I'm frustrated, because you keep falling for
their same overhyped claims time, after time... 

Stop running away from the good stuff, and being
sucked in by the junk... it's driving me nuts!

For example, over the past few days I've emailed
you about Rich Schefren's free training... 

Rich is one of the most successful, sought after
Internet business coaches in the world... and he
is a personal coach of mine.

He has helped thousands of people go from making
nothing at all, to having stable, and successful
online businesses in hundreds of niches... 

Yet for some reason that I don't understand, you
just don't seem interested...and that frustrates
the heck out of me. 

So I'm giving this one more shot... 

If this email gets just one person to listen to 
what Rich has to say, that's enough for me... 

That'll be one more person I helped. 

If you want to be that person, here's where you 
can register...
