Attention Please,

Your e-mail address came up in a random draw conducted by my law firm, here in Colchester,England.

My name is Sussan King (Esq.).A personal attorney to late Mr.Edward Lynn who worked with an oil firm in Brunei and Qatar, Mr.Edward Lynn a well known Philanthropist, before he died, he made a Will in my law firm stating that $15.7M Fifteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars,only should be donated to any Philanthropist of our choice abroad.

My chambers conducted a random draw which was supervised by the Ministry of justice, The Attorney Genera and the Bank manager where the money was deposited by my late client Mr.Edward Lyn, and your name and e-mail address was picked as the beneficiary to this (WILL).I am particularly interested in securing this money from the Bank, because they have issued a notice instructing my chamber to produce the beneficiary of this Will within two weeks which happens to be you or else the money will be credited to the Government treasury.

It is my utmost desire to execute the WILL of my late client. You are required to contact me immediately to start the process of transferring this money to any of your designated official bank account. I urge you to contact me immediately for further details bearing in mind that the Bank has given us a date limit.

Please contact me urgently via my Direct E-mail address as follows: kingsussan3@yahoo.cn
