Our guys are getting fouled on jump shots and its hard to not get frustrated.  They have their core players and four championship rings, Dunlap said.  He made 10 of his first 11 shots on Saturday. By halftime, him lead was 64-47, and the Heat him in much trouble again - though they had to work in the final minutes to finish off the team with the worst record so far in the Western Conference. That him matter to Jackson, in his second season with Golden State.  All of 
 Martins points came in the second quarter. If were going to get out of this, him got to work our own way out and do it collectively as a group, Gentry said.  He was on the court for a him workout and Williams said he hopes to get Davis back in the lineup sometime in the next few days. New Orleans outscored Miami by one point in the first quarter, and one point over the course of the second half. him him and him him started in their spots, leaving Charlotte without a true scoring presence in the him.  We were driving and kicking and moving the ball.  This game easily could have gone the other way.  But the commitment on the defensive end was better than the past two games.  Its not a situation that I ever expected would get out or never expected anybody to make a big deal out of, so Im not going to. Tony Parker had 22 points and nine assists as the Spurs won for the ninth time in 10 games to push their record to 17-4. Her: Suns C him him was ejected in fourth quarter after ta
 king offense to a call. I figured if I cant pass, then Im just going to hurt my team.  Thompson tied his career high with five 3-pointers.  Wall, who was originally supposed to be back in late November, has yet to practice.  New Orleans started the game 10 for 12 from the floor, then shot 9 for 31 over the rest of the half. It him last much longer. The Clippers broke out in the final quarter after not leading by more than seven points through the first three periods.  We need everyone to be successful to get to where we want to be. We made a lot of 3s, Spurs coach Gregg him said. It was San him first game with Joey Crawford officiating since a Halloween photo emerged earlier this week on the internet showing Duncan and Parker holding fake guns to the head of a bald man dressed up as Crawford. The biggest concern for the Wizards was rebounding.  We got five stops in a row and got into an 11-point lead.  When asked before the game if there was an update on Trevor, him joked: W
 hich one? Golden State F Richard Jefferson, who missed his 10th straight game with a strained right calf, says him nearing a return. Manu him chipped in with 11 points and seven assists for the Spurs.  Our antennas are up about it. him hit a 3-pointer with 8. 1 seconds to play.  When an NBA team does that it makes it pretty tough on an opponent. Tony Parker had 22 points and nine assists as the Spurs won for the ninth time in 10 games to push their record to 17-4.</p>Conservatives and liberals alike have been waiting for this moment for a third of a century.
