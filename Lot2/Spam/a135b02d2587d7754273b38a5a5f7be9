Subject:I agree to marry you!
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever woman, also I am  very kind and romantic. 

I adore kids, and I feel that it is time to have my own children.. It seems to be foolish to describe imaginary image of a loved one. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than beauty of the body. I want my man to be serious, educated and with good sense of humor. 
I want to love and to be loved http://nibinop.tha.im If you want to know me better
