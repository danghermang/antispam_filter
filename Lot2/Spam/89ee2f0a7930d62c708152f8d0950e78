Subject:One of my hobby right relationship with you
I do not know what to start with that’s why I'll start by telling you about myself. I consider myself quite a knowledgeable and clever girl, also I am  very nice and generous. 

I like jogging in the morning, riding my bicycle, having a picnic with my friends and family.. It seems to be foolish to describe the man whom I want to see by my side. I am looking for normal, realistic man. For me it is very important to meet my soul mate. Though, I can say for sure that appearance is far from being very important. 
The inner beauty is much more important than the body image. I want my man to be ambitious, communicative and with various interests. And I want to love my man with all my heart and soul http://vipizaq.hst5.com Let's start our acquaintance
