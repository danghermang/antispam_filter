Subject:Re: [burners] Montreal Decompression is 11/3!
My first thought for those seeking to couchsurf would be to post on the taBURNak FB event page (which I've shared on the Firefly FB group). The Montreal Burners are a friendly couch-having lot.

I don't have any firsthand data on hostels, and I can't recall the 1star hotel I stayed in the 1st 2 times I went. Will post more thoughts as they arise.
