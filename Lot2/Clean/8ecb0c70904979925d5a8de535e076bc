There is no external 8 ohm terminal on these machines.=20

It is easy to connect an 8 ohm spk to the amp by simply tracing the wire fr=
om the speaker power switch that goes to the speaker plug. the other wire g=
oes to chassis ground.

Removing the speaker plug will kill the B+ unless pins 2&3 are jumped.

The crossover box is there at the extreme right.

Since the speakers have been replaced a check of phasing is needed.

Take a battery of 1.5 to 6 volts, remove the speaker plug from the amp and =
connect the battery terminals to pins 1&4. Both woofer cones should move in=
 the same direction.

All speakers are to be 16 ohm to load the amp at 8 ohm. using lower impedan=
ce drivers will not have much effect on bass but will overload the amp and =
change the crossover frequency.

If you are using the original pickup with later styli, the rubbery damping =
material around the stylus cantilever may have dried out and collapsed.

If the machine has one of those (crappy) ceramic subs -that may be the caus=
e.


Check the action of the bass control. Seeburg uses a thin EQ on the preamp =
(not as much bass boost as a normal RIAA curve) and them makes up for that =
by using a huge amount of boost in the first 2/3 of the volume pot.=A0 If t=
he taps are not connected and functioning properly the machine will sound t=
hin.=20

There are other possibilities such as a output tran with shorted turns, and=
 of course, wiring mistakes. But try these and the other suggestions and yo=
u'll narrow it down.=20

This should be straight forward.

You need to run a few quick tests to determine what is causing your V200's =

sound performance.=A0=A0 The problem (in general) can lie with either the p=

cartridge, setup, the amplifier electronics, the speaker system or a combin=

of these.

Test 1

Using=A0one channel of a stereo or home theatre audio receiver (along with =

setup.=A0=A0 Test 3 will help you isolate that should you need to do that.

Test 2=20
A variation on that test involves the use of a test stereo bookshelf spkr t=

your juke until you've worked your way through these tests to determine whe=

Hope this helps,
