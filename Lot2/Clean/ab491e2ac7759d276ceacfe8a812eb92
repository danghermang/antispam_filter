Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] RF noise
Stu
I quite agree with you and the problem lies in the need for economic
growth at all costs, coupled with the relative unimportance of radio
comms in the modern world - especially hf, now that we are all wired
up.  So the 'authorities' don't see noise on HF as one of the big
problems.  I think the services use hf radio still, but they can place
antenna farms away from noise sources, where they can still enjoy a
quiet spectrum.  The rest of us have data on our copper-wire phone
lines and our power system, plus endless loud noise from anything with
a switch-mode power supply in it, which means just about everything
these days :(
