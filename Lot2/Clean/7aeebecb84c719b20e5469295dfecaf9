Subject:[CT Birds] 7pm strong wind from ESE
Weather report from glastonbury ct 700feet altitude at 7pm:
Steady 30-40mph wind from ESE. Gusting sometimes to double that. 
Almost no rain and occasional breaks in clouds to show the stars and bright moon. Easy to see the clouds zooming over. Very dramatic. Hopefully a few good birds up there getting a free-ride.
