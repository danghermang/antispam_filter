True.  But it's accurate enough for comparing 12v modules.  If one has a bum 
cell, or is significantly depreciated, this test is likely to tell you.  

For small loads, I use a "Watt's Up" meter for a much more accurate 
measurement of capacity.  It measures amp-hours and watt-hours, but it's 
pretty light duty and I wouldn't want to use it at much more than 10-15a of 
continuous current.
