Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Complete bird phylogenetic tree
Interesting Andrew.  I did notice from the families circle that their
analysis seemed to confirm Hackett et al. (2008), rather than Pacheco et al
(2011) - but I guess from what you say, and the time of which they started
the study, that they may have used the same data as Hackett, rather than
confirming it.  I'd really like to see a version with the individual
species represented, but I guess such an image might not exist.
