Subject:[h-cost] Mannequins for "Dickens" style costumes

I have been wanting to find mannequins on which I can display my Dickens style gowns and frock costs. I would love to display a grouping for Christmas.  Does anyone have a source or suggestion?  I live in Los Angeles area.  Thanks for any help on this everybody.  This list is a treasury of wonderful people with great ideas and resources.
