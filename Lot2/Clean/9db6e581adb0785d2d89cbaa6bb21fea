Subject:Re: [EVDL] Elcon PFC 1500 Died
There are only two reasons that I am aware that can cause a Manzanita 
charger to fail:
1) Disconnect the DC side under load.Even briefly. (Doesn't kill them 
every time, but often.)
2) Low budget PM generator for AC source. They _really_ don't like 
this for some reason.

I have been running these chargers for many many years and have only 
managed to wound one once. It was my own fault for rigging up a goofy 
temporary jumper cable output that had a loose connection.

If you have been running your Manzanita charger from a low-budget 
permanent magnet generator, then you can expect problems. Sometimes 
after the fact. I'll guess that the waveform or the power factor from 
the PM generator under full load is so weird that the charger 
magnetics overheat. Perhaps someone else has investigated more fully 
and has pinpointed the exact root cause.
