Subject:[CT Birds] Shippan Pt Storm Birds
10/30 - Shippan Pt., Stamford
Julian Hough with Patrick and Jim Dugan

I joined the Dugan brothers at their local haunt at Shippan pt. Jim has a better 
and more accurate tally of numbers, but the highlights were:

1 Pomarine Jaeger
1 Sooty Tern (distant, but most likely this species)
3 Leach's Petrels
