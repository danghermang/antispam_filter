Subject:[Jukebox-list] Is the valve amp in these mono ? Rowe Ami Cadette
I've worked on quite a few of these many years ago, but never seen one with
a mono valve amp in, only the transistorised option. Looking at the picture
in the ad below, the valve amp seems mono.

Is that correct ?

 

In fact, as I type, I think some of the ones with stereo amps in only had
one input plug connected.
