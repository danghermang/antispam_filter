Subject:[burners] The Redtail Experience
Hello dearest burners,

I wanted to let you know that Redtail has an opening and to remind everyone=
 that our space is available for certain types of events. =A0

As many of you are aware, we are a collaborative of burners and fireflies w=
ho share work and performance space in Fort Point Channel. =A0No one lives =
there; instead, we reserve it as a space for creativity and events. =A0For =
me, it is a little chunk of the playa that happens to be downtown. =A0Just =
like Burning Man and Firefly, it is what you make of it, and we have room f=
or one more person to participate.

Do you want to make big art? =A0Redtail has space where you can spread out =
and work on projects? =A0It's there are few enough of use that you can take=
 over a corner for a while and have at it. =A0

Want access to tools? =A0Need a place to build and install your new CNC rou=
ter? =A0We're no Artisans' Asylum, but we have a basic wood shop and weldin=
g gear. =A0

Dance, do yoga, or something along those lines? =A0We have a sprung dance f=
loor that's also been used for a variety of=A0physical=A0activities. =A0Red=
tail is a great place to host classes or have performances. =A0

Play music? =A0Sure, you can use Redtail as a jam or practice space. =A0It =
seems that some of the other members just get together and jam at least onc=
e a week, although sometimes there appears to be something more formal goin=
g on. =A0(We now seem to have a badass 32.8 channel Mackie, which is totall=
y overkill for my listening to NPR while sewing.)

You are looking for a place to have an event, but you are not interested in=
 joining as a member. =A0We can perhaps do that. =A0Many of you have come t=
o late-night DJ-oriented dance events. =A0While we still do those from time=
 to time, we are more=A0interested=A0in putting=A0community-friendly art an=
d music events. =A0Feel free to be in touch if you have an idea.

If any of that sounds interesting, I'd be happy to tell you more in person.=
 =A0
