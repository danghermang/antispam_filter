Subject:[Jukebox-list] Mills Zephyr Amplifier Question
My Mills Zephyr amplifier (MCP 2802 or 2806 - which was rebuilt when I =
bought it) has started acting weird. =20

It played fine for several years and now it heats up, the sound cuts =
out, and a long black cylindrical tune type thing (sorry can=E2=80=99t =
figure out what it  it is called) heats up and starts smoking.  Could it =
be just that this particular part of the amp has gone bad?  Looking at =
my schematics I think  it might be a choke or a flasher but I am not =
sure.  Kind of looks like a black waxy or plastic tube.  After leaving =
it for a while it started playing sound but then it did it again.

Could this part just go bad or is something else causing it?  Do you =
know where I can get one of these?

I could take the amp out and take a picture and post it if that helps.

Thanks.

Peter
