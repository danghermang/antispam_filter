Actually, quite a bit of the critical Koha config is stored in plain-text
or as XML markup, starting with koha-conf.xml, the apache2 site specific
configs, the bib1 attributes definitions etc.

For things that are stored in MySQL, I take sql dumps at different point in
time (which working) and store that. Whenever, I need to look at what
changed, I run a diff between the respective SQL dumps. Not the most
elegant approach, but it gets my job done. Also, the sql dumps allow me to
revert to a specific configuration.

The things I dump out at are typically sysprefs, marc tag and structure
tables, the categories, stopwords etc just to give an example..

cheers
