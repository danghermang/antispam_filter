Ah crap I forgot about this one - fixed that now.

Whoops - pretty embarrassing.  I fixed that in 5.2.6+dfsg-5~bpo60+2
(i.e reverted it back to use /var/run).  Please see
http://sultan.timedout.org/~bart/debian/barts-squeeze-backports/ again
as well as http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=3Dpkg-bacula/bacula.git;a=3D=
tag;h=3Drefs/tags/debian/5.2.6%2Bdfsg-5_bpo60%2B2
tag.

I *did* check the installation in chroot this time :) and it installed
fine (bacula-fd, bacula-sd=E2=80=A6).  I've it running and simply upgraded
last time hence didn't spot that problem=E2=80=A6

Let me know should you spot anything else.  But I reckon it should be
good to go now.
