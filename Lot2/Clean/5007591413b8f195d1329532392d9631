All public chargers that I have seen that offer 110V, it is in
*addition* to the Level 2 charging, so 2 can charge at the same time,
I could argue that I am even less blocking someone else from charging
by limiting my charging to Level 1. (I could if I wanted install an
inlet on my car to use public level 2 because my charger allows both)

You missed the point, the larger chargers allow you to charge at a Level
2 or
Level 1 charger. It would be rude for a EV to take up a long time at a
public charger using 110vac and maybe 6amp. I can tell you don't use the
public chargers, cause this is a real problem and it still boils down to
money. Look at the production cars and try to follow their example. If
not,
the resale value of your EV will be in the toilet. Look at the garbage
on
ebay and you can see what I am talking about. This brings up another
point,
at the recent Plug-in-America event in Cupertino I was appalled at the
cars
that were there being driven by all those on the forums claiming
knowledge
of conversions. Charging cords of 12ga dragging on the ground, etc. I
have
never seen such sloppy work, yet those same people are all over the
forums
miss leading those that really need help and don't know what they are
doing.
I wont mention names as they know who I am talking about. This in not
only
my opinion, but is shared by most all the students I have had for over 5
years.
