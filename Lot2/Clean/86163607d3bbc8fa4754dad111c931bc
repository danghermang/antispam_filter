Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Alan and Ed

Maybe milliohms is a slight overestimate of the radiation resistance
of a normal ferrite rod antenna, but obviously it is essential to know
the radiation resistance plus the inductance and the loss resistance
to be able to calculate the performance of the the rod (with coil) as
an antenna as part of a receive system.

I believe that once these three quantites are known it is a simple
piece of circuit theory to calculate the rf power output from the
antenna and therefore its effective noise figure.  I have tried it
many times with different practical receive systems and it seems to
work.

We know that small antennas have a constant capture area regardless of
their size if losses are ignored, because the quantity V^2/4Rr is
constant [the power from a matched generator of voltage V and source
resistance R is V^2/4R] and there are formulas for V  and Rr.  The
capture area only depends on the wavelength if the losses are ignored.

So if V^2 / 4Rr is the available power, it is only necessary to
calculate the actual power output of a circuit with a source voltage V
and then resistors of Rr, Rloss and reactance X in series.

Having done this many times for various receive systems I believe it works.

The calculation has also been done and married up with detailed
measurements for an air-cored HF loop antenna with a 1-metre diameter,
and published in the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, and I
think the article is on Jack's library.  It also describes how the
formulas for Rr and X are accurate but the loss-resistance Rloss is
more difficult to predict, and is best calculated from a measurement
of the Q.  That work is in the peer-reviewed literature.

There are two ways to do this, series and parallel tuning and they give totally different results. If you tune out with a series capacitor then the situation with a finite load is much the same as with an infinite load, although one would expect a slightly lower voltage increase than 25 when the ferrite is added because of the ferrite loss resistance.

To achieve the high Q we will need a high input resistance and this will have a high noise voltage, so the signal to noise ratio may be no better. Indeed the best signal to noise would be with the receiver matched to the radiation resistance but since this is measured in milliohms or less this is hardly practical.
