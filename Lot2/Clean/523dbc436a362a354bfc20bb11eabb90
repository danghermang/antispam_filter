Subject:[Birding-Aus] FNQ sightings
A new and perhaps unwelcome local species for me was a Eurasian Starling on flooded fields just north of Brady's Lagoon (which is north of Mareeba) on Oct 28.
Cassowary and 3 chicks doing well at Black Mt Road, and the big female was in today looking much better then when I saw her looking tatty and exhausted about a month ago, her bald patches have healed up well.
Still 2 Radjah Shelduck at Cairns Centenary Lakes, feeding with Black Ducks  and both Magpie and Feral geese from a tourist giving out bread.
No Buff-breasted Paradise Kingfisher yet, the early ones look to have gone through but i heard none at Kingfisher Park, Black Mt Road Kuranda or Daintree on Oct 30.
A couple of Black Bittern and 3 nests of Papuan Frogmouth on Sauce's Daintree river cruise.
Maryfarms had about 6 Aus Bustards, 5 Aus Pratincoles and about 8 Diamond Doves along the West Mary Road on Oct 30.
