Subject:Re: [EVDL] EVLN: Plug in and power up, the msn way to nab an Ion EV
Wow!  Just spoke to the dealer in question in Cambridge and the deal is leg=
it.  The cars even come with the ChaDeMo socket as standard.  Best proper E=
V deal I've ever seen.  Limited numbers tho (apparently) and when they have=
 sold out the next lot will be back at MRP.
