Subject:[child_lit] Children's illustration exhibit in Texas
Dear All,

I just came across this article on an exhibit of Fred Marcellino's 
illustrations in Plainview, Texas: 
http://www.myplainview.com/lifestyles/article_15dd8ef0-1afd-11e2-b6f1-001a4bcf887a.html

Maybe some of you in Texas will get to see it.

Yours,
Jenny
