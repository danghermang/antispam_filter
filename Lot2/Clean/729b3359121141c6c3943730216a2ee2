   Hello braun as Welcome to this Tech Resources update from The Register

   Unified Storage Consolidation for Microsoft Windows Installations
   http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9d4/5613a/4ff/9a382fd1?td=3Dm_wpe=
_h

      Unified storage is infrastructure that supports multiple types of
      storage within a single management framework. In an ideal scenario, an
      admin can access a single set of tools and functions that are
      transparent to the type of storage used.

      The specific business case analysis detailed in this paper compares a
      base case of a varied number of storage solutions with a unified
      storage solution for a Wikibon Reference Organization with revenues of
      $250 million, 1,000 staff, and an IT budget of $7.5 million.

Endpoint security - pressures and priorities
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9f8/5613a/4ff/93c3d1fd?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Organisations are struggling to keep pace with the changing security
   needs and demands of their user base. Well established trends such as
   the move to mobile and flexible working and the consumerisation of IT
   mean that there is increasing pressure on organisations to open up
   their infrastructure to end users who want to bring their own devices -
   be they tablets, netbooks, laptops or smartphones - to work. Managing
   the security needs of such an environment means there needs to be
   increased emphasis on security on the devices themselves.

   However, a survey of IT security decision makers in UK SMEs found that
   while many acknowledge the reality of this situation, policies and
   technologies, particularly with regard to automatic upgrading and
   patching of endpoint security solutions, have yet to catch up.

Many devices, one policy

   multiple and remote work devices.

Unlocking the Enterprise Cloud
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a14/5613a/4ff/152c101b?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Cloud computing stands well poised to help enterprises significantly
   improve their business IT speed, agility and costs. However, the fear
   of technology "lock-in" - difficulty in switching cloud hosting
   providers or platforms due to enterprise size and scale - continues to
   discourage some large corporations from realizing the benefits of the
   Cloud.

   This whitepaper discusses the lock-in enterprises face with cloud
   computing and how OpenStack open-source platform can help. Next, it
   defines in detail the components and inner workings of OpenStack
   technology. It concludes by providing basic guidance on how to help
   successfully evaluate the value of OpenStack technology for the
   enterprise.

Securing the Mobile App Market
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a1b/5613a/4ff/85c496b2?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   The emergence of mobile applications has fundamentally changed the way
   that millions of people around the world work, play, and communicate.
   Users can now download every type of application imaginable - from
   games, to maps, to movie and TV show tie - ins, to apps that will turn
   a device into a flashlight, and more-directly to their smart phones and
   other mobile devices.

   Though the market for mobile apps is still relatively young, it has
   grown exponentially over the past several years and will continue to
   expand rapidly. Fueled by millions of consumers and business users
   looking for innovative applications, this explosive growth presents a
   tremendous opportunity for software developers looking to create - and
   monetise - the next hit app to help people be more productive, or
   simply have fun.

   But developers aren't the only ones looking to profit from the surge in
   apps - cybercriminals want to infect and exploit as many mobile devices
   as they can to steal confidential information. Infected apps are not
   only a threat to mobile device users, but also to network and platform
   providers, device manufacturers,and the reputation of the industry as a
   whole.

   Fortunately, developers can protect their code - and their customers -
   with a straightforward and easy-to-manage technology: code signing
   certificates. This white paper will detail the rise of mobile
   applications and why code signing certificates are essential to
   protecting the entire mobile apps ecosystem.
