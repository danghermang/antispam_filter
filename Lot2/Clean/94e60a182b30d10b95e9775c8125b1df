Please check abram62 's feedback before dealing with him. If you still 
choose to deal with him, I wish you the best of luck. He's running some kind 
of con.

Hi Mirko and list,

We communicated over the eBay email about this bidder. He is currently
bidding on some of my items on ebay (almittmet). I offer shipping in
two days depending on payment. I sometimes think the people up to no
good have questionable ID's in hopes you will ship before payment.
That's always a mistake if you do.

Ebay offers up so much buyer protection and I'm just not going to send
an item before payment unless I know the buyer. I'll let the list know
as there are many sellers on ebay here if I have anytrouble with this
bidder, in the event he wins and doesn't come through. Best!
