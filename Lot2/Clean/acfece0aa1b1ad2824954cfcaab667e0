Subject:[h-cost] Umm. . . please say something historical?
Hi guys,

Technology is wonderful. . . and for theatre costuming I'm sure it's a  
timesaver. But I'm laboring under the illusion that this is a  
historical costuming list, and wearying of machine embroidery (begging  
all your pardon. . . 'tis true).

Please somebody, talk historical costume?
