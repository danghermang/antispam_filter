Subject:[EVDL] Regen vs. coast was Best EV Tires
I agree it makes sense to use the regen when stopping is a must just  as 
you would use your brakes. It seems people overlook the losses of converting  
energy and the energy lost in getting the vehicle back up to speed. 
 
My 30% recovery was only on one hill with a Solectria force. It is a very  
steep hill and it took the full regen capacity for most of the hill. That 
was 8  years ago and I have not really paid too much attention to regen in the 
last six  years or so. I just maximize what has given me the best 
performance.
 
The misconception is you can drive like an ICE (driving as fast as possible 
 to a red light which requires heavy braking) and regen will recover all 
the  energy lost. Its simply not the case. 
 
An EV is vastly more efficient  then an ICE and driving  wasteful like an 
ICE has even a greater impact on your range. That is why  its always better 
to coast as well as retain as much momentum as  possible. The only part that 
gets tricky is coming up to a light and your not  sure when its going to 
change or a long line of stopped cars. I actually find  this challenge an 
enjoyable part of driving. 
 
I try to judge the distance to where I would need to regen all the way to  
make a complete stop. Then use a lower amount of regen well before that 
point.  So I can coast to a green light or the cars at the light waiting have  
started moving. This way one can retain as much forward momentum. If the  
light or cars force a stop then I know I timed it right if only using regen  
brings the vehicle to a stop with out engaging the brakes. 
 
The above only works well if you don't have an ICE driver riding your  
bumper or your on a four lane road where they can drive past you. That way the  
ICE driver is not restrained from their normal driving pattern. Racing to  
the next stop so they can slam on their brakes and then restart from  a 
complete stop.  
 
Since an ICE has such a vast quantity of energy on board. Most ICE  drivers 
are either clueless or could care less. So one of the greatest  challenges 
of maximizing your range in an EV is having to mitigate the  driving 
patterns of ICE drivers.

That's pretty much how I use regen, and I pretty much  agree with your 
numbers
(although the max I have gotten is 20% (up/down the  same hill).  As you say
if traffic and road conditions permit you to  coast, that is what you want 
to
do, not slow down, which is what regen  does.  You wouldn't apply your
mechanical brakes in that situation, so  why would you apply regen?  I think
"coasting or regen" is the wrong  way to look at it.  Rather, the choice is
having controllable regen  capability so you can use it to slow or stop in
place of using mechanical  brakes, and in the same way, or not having 
regen.
