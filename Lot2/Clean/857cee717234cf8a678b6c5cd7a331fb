Subject:[child_lit] locations-related; Moomin tray
I know there are lots of MoominFans on the list, so I'm passing this link
along http://www.huset-shop.com/moomin-valley-tray-p-1904.html - it's quite
a lovely-looking wooden serving tray with an image of the Moomin Valley on.
Comes in small & large, and both are under $30.  I always get all excited
about children's-book-related objects, and this one was no exception.

happy weekend - east coast folks, stay safe & snug from the impending
storms.
