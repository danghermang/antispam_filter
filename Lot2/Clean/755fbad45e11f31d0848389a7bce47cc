I had a lawn business with 84v mower and have had a few 120v chain
saws that I ran off the mower ( along with an edger and hedger
trimmer) . Most E chain saws I've had where PM motors ( permanent
magnet ) and there is a bridge rectifiers to convert the Ac to Dc so
either way you plugged it in it worked.

 An electromagnetic field coil is used that has its polarity

I never got mine set up the way I wanted it ,, I believed the switch
takes the arc when opening not closing so I'd use the switch to start
it and pull the plug (by standing on the cord and lift the saw up ) to
stop it . A few time I let the switch slip and its still working .
If farmers start worrying about "safety issue" we'll all go hungry
