Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] NASA SETI Misappropriation of Tax Payer Funds
Greg, Mendy, and All,

To the best of my knowledge, no public (NASA) funds have been spent on this=
 meteorite fall.
I will post to this List a local newspaper article that explains that the f=
inder (Lisa Webber) gave N01 to her neighbor (Glenn Rivera) because the sto=
ne hit her house on his birthday.=A0 Subsequently, Glenn has loaned the N01=
 stone to Peter for "scientific studies".=A0 As a result, Glenn was offered=
 and accepted a seat on the airship as an observer.=A0 =


My bad, for not posting this article before, but I thought all of the Novat=
o news stories were over-saturating the List, but now I see there is no suc=
h thing as too much information.=A0 I promise not to make that mistake agai=
n.=A0 I will endeavor to do a better job of reporting from the field. =
