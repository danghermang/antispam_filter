Hmm - I wonder how that one - "Truesight" - compares with that famous SF
story "In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is King" - which is
fascinating, because in fact he wasn't a king at all. I think it ends with
them putting out that thing that flaps on the front of his face.
Fascinating...

There is the Truesight trilogy about a colony of (apparently) genetically
blind people. The protagonist gains sight and deals with the consequences
during the first novel, Truesight by David Stahler
