Subject:[meteorite-list] AD: Last Meteorites for the year posted.
Hi List and Happy Halloween. I have posted my last meteorites for sale for 
this year 2012 on my Website. I will be drawn away to another favorite hobby 
of mine that I have neglected for some time. This will not allow me to post 
any new sales until spring of 2013. I will still be updating the Website 
each month as usual, just not the "Meteorite Sales" page. Anyways, just 
click the link below to view these last sales. I am sure there is something 
for sale of interest for any collector.
A hats off and a special sincere thank you, to all of you who have visited 
my Website and to those of who have done business or trades with me this 
past year.
