Just as a quick note: This doesn't happen usually in social network sites. The 
evolutionary argument can be applied on any conflict or problem, but the 
quality of the reflected development (called progress or "competition") is 
skewed once a monopoly is in place. We have to look at the problem at hand to 
understand how tools interact and what the users want to do.

I think so. The problem is that to reach consensus you really need most users, 
so once a tool would succeed without OVN, it would have a very unfair 
advantage over the competition. Or a bit more radical, we lose the consensus 
approach completely if tools don't mirror each other. Once the consensus is 
split already, no e-dem solution can succeed anymore without becoming the 
monopoly itself even for simple majority rule (because of segmentation).
