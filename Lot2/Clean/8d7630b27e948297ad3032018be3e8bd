Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Thieft of archives
: Does anyone have any info of the member that posted the contents of
: this archive to another open site without permission and being
: outright theft ?

Group/list archivers have been around for a couple of decades that I know of
and probably longer.  These are automatically done by webcrawlers.  There is
no one person or a thief and it happens regardless of the domain or
"policy".  There is no theft, this system is neither closed, nor restricted.
No protection is offered.  To be shocked at this activity now is absurd.

Kurt
