Subject:Re: r8168b woes
ugh, Actually I have to keep this box pretty stable. This kernel
requires several updates to the base system and tools, I was mostly
making sure this problem was on someones radar. But I think it is.
Just don't want to get stuck when upgrading.

I have a live Debian script for a netboot. I'll try setting it up with
that. I can make some network tests at that point.

Thanks
