Very nice and very fast car, but not even close =

to the world's quickest or fastest EV, in reality.

Not even in Europe. Sam and Oliver Young, Black Current:
http://www.evtuners.com/2011/09/01/worlds-quickest-electric-car-black-curre=
nt-iii/
  I believe that their home track in the UK, Santa Pod, is FIA sanctioned:
http://www.santapod.co.uk/dr_fia.php
Thus, it is quite likely that the Black Current, =

not the Rimac, has the FIA top acceleration record.

The Rimac has a respectable 11.8 second 1/4 mile =

time, but that is truly pathetic compared to the =

9.51 second 1/4 mile record set by the Black =

Current (or also the high 9's by the 100% street legal White Zombie.)
