Subject:[CT Birds] BirdingPal Inquiry
I received my very first BirdingPal request in years, and I am unfortunatel=
y going away on business.=A0 =



The inquiry came from a Kiwi (ie, a New Zealand gentleman) who is staying r=
ight now, in Cheshire, does not have access to an automobile, and is lookin=
g to go birding any weekday during the next 2 weeks.

If anyone is in this neighborhood, and can host a weekday birding trip, any=
where, please shoot me an email off-line and I will share contact informati=
on.=A0 I'm sure it will be a mutually educational experience!
