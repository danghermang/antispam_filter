Subject:[Birding-Aus] Coonabarabran, NSW
We are going to Coonabarabran shortly for a week and would like any  
recommendations for good birding locations.  I have the brochure "Bird  
routes of Baradine and the Pilliga", which looks very useful.

Most of our birding has been more coastal so we are interested in  
inland birds, but with nothing particular in mind.

Also what is the best (quickest) way to travel there from Ryde in  
Sydney on a Saturday?  It seems to be either - over the Blue Mountains  
by Bells Line of road or Great Western Highway (is the Highway still  
plagued by road works?)   - or the Golden Highway through Denman and  
Merriwa.

Any advice is appreciated.
