One possibility is to hold a discussion whenever there's a problem
that needs addressing.  The focus of the discussion would then be on
the problem, instead of a project (project talks could still happen,
of course, in some weeks).  Like the project talks (but unlike the
regular meetings), the problem talks would each have a single focus
(one problem).  So those who were interested could attend, and the
schedule could "roam" more easily to accomodate them, as Ed suggests.

They do in fact interest me greatly, but as someone who is employed in the United States, the choice of German 21:30 on Mondays lands during the U.S. business day, making it usually impossible for me to attend. (And should anyone in Asia wish to participate, it lands in the middle of their night.)
