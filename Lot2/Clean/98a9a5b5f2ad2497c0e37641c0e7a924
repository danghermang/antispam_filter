Subject:[child_lit] Books for new baby like Blueberry Girl?
Neil Gaiman's Blueberry Girl is a perfect new baby girl book. Any suggestions for a book with that same spirit of wonder that is gender neutral? We have friends that don't want to know in advance what sex their baby is, and I need books for presents for all those baby shower events coming up, And if anyone has ideas for boy specific books, like Blueberry Girl, that would also help. 
Thanks!
