Subject:[child_lit] Critical term
This is slightly OT, but does any one know if there is a specific critical
term for nature presenting as a character in a narrative? The request I was
sent asks: "when nature has agency and acts (with intent - often
maliciously) against man"? Ruskin's notion of "pathetic fallacy" ALMOST
works, but not quite.. I was wondering if there is a more specific term=8A?
Anyone?

Thanks!
