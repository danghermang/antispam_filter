Subject:Re: [burners] Chess set
I have a couple nice sets you can choose from. A larger wooden table set,
smaller folding wooden set, and a roll-up mat set that was recently given
to me as a gift that I haven't tried out yet. You're welcome to borrow any
of the three that you would like. I'm in Newton Centre and should be around
all day. Respond off list if you would like to swing by and pick one up.

And while were on the topic, I would love to play chess w anyone out there
who enjoys the game. Anybody up for a chess date sometime soon?

-Ted
