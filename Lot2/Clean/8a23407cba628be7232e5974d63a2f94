Shankar,
That's usually a "sign" of a "dirty" relay--

Coin is inserted and Select lamp is ON.

Normally, when making a selection the select lamp goes off and comes back on when the letter and number keys are released after each selection.

What recently developed:
the select lamp blanks out for seconds longer and then the 2 keys are released.

Any ideas what might be causing this?

Thank you

Shankar Singh
