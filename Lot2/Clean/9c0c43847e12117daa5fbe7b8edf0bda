Subject:[CT Birds] Fwd:  Red Breasted NH, & usual suspects.
You'll be glad to know that our RBNH has learned to use the feeder a bit better -- a bit more cautious that TT, coming, pausing on holder, quick land & grab, & fly away to eat.  Smartening up.

Time to add some seed.  Gusting here so far, little rain.  I think our location is better than many's among this circle.

Also: White Breasted NH, Red Bellied WP, F. Cardinal.

No grackles or mourning doves -- ! -- & no WTSp  or Juncos.

> 10/29/12 - Hamden, North Lake -- Red Breasted Nuthatch at back feeder.

> I put our feeders back up, sans witch's hat (aka wind sock), and it's been mobbed by House Finch, + some goldfinch, chickadees, titmice, house sparrows, a couple of blue jays, some red winged black birds, downy, and the above-noted RBNH, a rather dim bird who was waiting for a house finch to abandon its perch, while several other perches were free, even fluttering at the bird to get it to leave (no go) -- and the RBNH is at it again.  Yo, birdbrain, *try another perch!*
> 
> Well, the perch became free, and the li'l feller still had problems -- flew at it a couple of times, landed & flew away, finally landed & took one seed.  Not an efficient feeding strategy (for which, observe all the other sit-&-stuff birds).

> Around Lake Whitney &c.:  2 male Hooded Mergansers, 2 Pied Billed Grebes, report of Bald Eagle, and I did see what sure seemed a B.E. head in the pine trees, so I'm pretty sure.
