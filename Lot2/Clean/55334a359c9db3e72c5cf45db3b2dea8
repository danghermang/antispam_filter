Subject:[bcp] Monday Riding
I just realized that I don't have to work tomorrow and I didn't get to ride
today.  Does anyone want to join me for a slightly slower version of Howard
Haber's ride tomorrow?  You can email me or call me in the morning after 7
a.m. My home number is best between 7 and 9 a.m.
