Subject:[MG] InterMix
Welcome Roger,

The mechanism of InterMix (if I understand) reminds me of Vilfredo,
but the possibility of creative literary apps (you mention poetry)
reminds me of recombinant text.  Recombinant text is what brought me
to work in e-democracy in the first place, but my earlier prototypes
were literary apps.
