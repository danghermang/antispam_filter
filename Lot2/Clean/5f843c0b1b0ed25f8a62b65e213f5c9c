Subject:Re: [EVDL] Calb battery issue
The voltage droop when my Thundersky cells were cold was the driving reason
for my modifications last year.  I added 1/2" foam insulation and 1/4"
plywood around the cells and heaters under 1/4" aluminum plates.  So far,
the insulation is helping enough that I haven't had to plug in the heaters.

If your cells don't like the environmental conditions, it is time to create
them conditions that make them happy.  My intent is to keep the cells
insulated and heated to75F when parked.  The cells will cool down somewhat
while driving, but should still be warm enough.  The heaters are Hydor
Hydrokables with thermostats.  They are attached to the back side of the
aluminum plate in a serpentine pattern.
