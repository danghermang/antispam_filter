That would constitute a change from the existing text, which several
folks spoke against at the PPM. I'd like to get more feedback before
changing it back again. Comments from others in the community would be

I believe that would effectively allow everyone to transfer v4/28s
today based on 4.10 - is this something the community wants to allow?
More feedback in this area would also be helpful.
