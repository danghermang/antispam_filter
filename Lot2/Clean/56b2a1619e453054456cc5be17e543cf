I would use both a light, and a resistor. It's a redundant solution, and 
both can be chosen to be extremely reliable. Plus, the parts won't even 
cost you a dollar.

An inexpensive neon indicator is a good choice for the light. They 
basically don't wear out. Even if they do, their failure mode is an open 
circuit.

And, just pick a resistor rated for (say) 2x the voltage and wattage 
that will ever flow in it.
