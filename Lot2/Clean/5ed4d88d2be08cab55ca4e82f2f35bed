Subject:[OzFurry] Blue Cards for Fursuiting?
Hi all!
     I'm slowly working on getting better so I can be out more; and I am 
starting to work on gatherings bits and pieces together for fursuiting 
in public.   In order to make it a bit more amenable to the general 
public for operating in places like malls and/or South Bank (or at least 
reduce the hassles of doing so) I'd like to look into getting a Blue 
Card.   Now has anyone gone through this for fursuiting purposes at 
all?  If so what hoops did you have to go through for not being attached 
to a particular organisation? Basically wondering if people have looked 
into this before and what has their experiences been so far to to date.

You can find out more info about Blue Cards (the QLD side at least) here
