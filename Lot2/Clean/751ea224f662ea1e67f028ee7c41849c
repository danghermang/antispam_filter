Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Ratings v Spurs
I do think Luiz had a good game.

But he was certainly not flawless. He is still sometimes the victim of poor decision making, but he is improving.

And I think he must accept part of the blame for both the Spurs goal, even if not being the main culprit. On their second, Defoe shouldn't have been allowed to get the ball and finish, being between Luiz and Cahill. L and C must take a collective responsibility for that, even if I think in that particular case Cahill is more to blame. For the first goal, it's already been said that conceding the freekick was needless, and it's obviously a contributing factor to the goal. On that freekick, the defence was not adequately organised, and that also must partially be a collective responsibility of the defensive line. Gallas shouldn't have been allowed to be unmarked.

There were other instances when Luiz was sloppy, but as usual he mixes these occasions up with brilliance. He had a good game; he is a very good player; from time to time he is, however, still a liability.
