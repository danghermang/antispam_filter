Subject:[Jukebox-list] Rowe Ami mm3 latch solenoid info needed
Hello,
  I have a Rowe Ami MM3 button assembly, not the entire jukebox.   What is =
the voltage of the latch solenoid?
  Does anyone have a diagram or schematic that describes the circuit for th=
e latch solenoid?  Maybe one for the selection circuit?
 I wish to use the original latch and hold circuit or something close to it=
.

  I have asked a lot of questions but not specific enough and have gotten n=
o reply's, so here I go again.
