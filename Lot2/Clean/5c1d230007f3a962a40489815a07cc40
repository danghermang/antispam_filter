Subject:Re: [Koha] Data Migration (Dennis Njuguna)
Thank you Sunil for that info, I have found the current one is holding info
at tag 852 I have edited it using MARCEdit 8.5 and when I import I see
there are items imported though when I go to the book itself to view it
tells me that "no physical items for this record"

what could I be doing wrong?
