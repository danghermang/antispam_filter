Subject:Re: [burners] Montreal Decompression is 11/3!
Another cheap lodging option if 6-8 people want to come down as a group has
been mentioned by Leah, who's doing art placement for the event. A friend
of hers rents her spacious apartment out for $500/night, which if 8 of you
come up comes to $62.50 per person, and it's available 11/2-11/4.

As you can imagine Leah's pretty busy right now, so please read her *whole*
message below and, if a group of you are interested, have one person from
the group contact her _before this coming weekend, sooner is better_.
******************************
"I am happy to be the contact, however, I would prefer if someone from the
Boston Crew could be responsible for organizing the group, finding out how
many people are interested, collecting the names, how many nights they want
to stay, and collecting the $  to make the reservation=85
Then that 1 person could communicate with me =85 as I don't have time to de=
al
with a bunch of people individually.

Here is the link detailing the space:

NOTE: This is for info only! If they are interested, they should go through
me, as they will get the lowest rate!!!

So get a group representative from the Boston Crew to contact me!
Send them my personal e-mail:
leahbizier@gmail.com

I need to know ASAP, as My friend is going away next weekend, and she will
need to know before hand!
Thanks,
Leah***
