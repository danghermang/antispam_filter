Subject:[CT Birds] Black Vultures, Lantern Hill North Stonington
My husband and I too advantage of the great weather and hiked the Lantern
Hill trail in North Stonington.  There were a ton of Turkey Vultures
around, fun to watch because some of them were below us.  I noticed two
vultures soaring higher up and realized both were Black Vultures.  I
haven't seen many in CT.  There were also a ton of Golden-crowned Kinglets
and a Brown Creeper.
