Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Another Crystal Radio Question
Kirk

Supposing it was an AM radio, which can be assumed, the wavelength
will be be 180-550 metres, so adjacent tables are a small fraction of
a wavelength apart.

But the main thing you are still lagging on is that antennas in AM
radios are mismatched by a factor of 60-80 dB.  That explains why
Oliver did not see an effect and why you won't either, if you took the
trouble to do the experiment.
