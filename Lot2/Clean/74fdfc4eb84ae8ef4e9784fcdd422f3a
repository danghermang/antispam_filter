Monica and Richie, I enjoyed both your posts about what constitutes historical fiction. I myself did not see Endangered as historical but your posts made me think about what that means, anyway. 

In the realm of grownup fiction, the Historical Novel Society says the cutoff is 50 years:

But all things being relative, in our universe of books for the young, 20 seems to make more sense to me. The 80's after all are history to someone who's 10, where the 90's may arguably be presented as the recent past, but not yet history. Still, as in the case of so much writing, we make up these boundaries as we go along--I love the anecdote about Hilary Mantel starting to write about the French Revolution, taking books out of the library, then asking herself, "What am I doing?" The answer of course, was writing a book. We fall into genre and form much as we fall into story and in the end the definitions of those things are arbitrary and shifting.
