Using that same (poor) logic a half wave dipole is not resonant.

Just to note that a 1/2WL vertical monopole is far from self-resonant.

A NEC4 model of a 77m series-fed, base-driven monopole having an OD of 760mm 
(L/D = 101) shows a terminal impedance of about 550 -j 350 ohms on 1850 kHz, 
when driven against a perfect ground plane.

These values also are supported by the measured curves in Figs 2.15 and 2.16 
in RADIO ANTENNA ENGINEERING by E. A. Laport.
