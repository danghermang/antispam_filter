Subject:Re: [EVDL] Neutral Timing Is Best for Commuter Vehicles with Tranny
Hi Mark,

According to Netgains motor drawing... http://www.go-ev.com/PDFs/003_08_02_04-08259_ImPulse_9_Eng_Drawing.pdf
from neutral to advanced is 12 (actual) degrees and neutral to retarded 14 degrees.   I loaded the drawing into a CAD app and measured it pretty accurately.  Not sure why they don't mark it on the drawing!

When I went up the 5% grade section on the freeway at 60mph, 3000rpm's, the battery amps read 300A as before but the motor amps is 500A (was 400A at neutral setting).  About1/2 way up the 30 second hill, the 1231C controller started current limiting and the car slowed to 45mph at the crest of the hill  (previously maintained 60mph in neutral)  .  I then got off at the next ramp and tried again going back and again the speed sagged to 45mph as the controller current limited the motor after 500A on the motor for about 15 seconds (300A battery).  I watched the battery amps sag to 100A as the car slowed with the accelerator peddle mashed.    I set the timing back to neutral (so I can drive without getting runover by 18 wheelers).  It looks to me a 1" change in the rotation of a 9" diameter motor would be less than 12 degrees but I guess that's electrical, not!
