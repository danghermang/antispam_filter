Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Birds at the eclipse
At Yorkeys Knob this morning did not notice any thing different happening with local bird life.
I was lucky enough to see the 1999 eclipse in Newquay (Cornwall UK) this took place at roughly 11am I did put my moth trap out and caught a couple of spp but did not notice anything this morning.
