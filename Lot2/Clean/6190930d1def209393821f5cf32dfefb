Subject:[burners] [OT] sysadmin / automation job
At my day job, we're looking to get a few more people on our team.
What we're looking for is people who have done enough coding to be able to
write automation scripts in ruby, perl, or python (and willing to cross
learn) to manage vms and applications in our datacenter.

Preferably a few college programming classes, or someone who's a decent
developer but who is tired of writing apps.

Someone with some experience running a some linux servers is preferable.

hit me up off list if you want to know more.
