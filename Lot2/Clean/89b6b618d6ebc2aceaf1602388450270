Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] OT- Hurricane Sandy
Hi Greg and List,

2004 was a crazy hurricane year.  If we are lucky, we won't see
another year like that in our lifetimes.  As Greg can attest to, being
well inland is no guarantee of safety during a hurricane.  Coastal
residents have the added worry of storm surge, but inland residents
can expect tornadoes, powerful wind gusts, periods of intense rain,
and flash flooding.

A couple more minor but possibly important things many people overlook
before a storm hits - make sure all of your (and your family)
medications are refilled, because you may be stuck for a few days or
more without medication if the timing of the storm and your refill
date are close.  Also make sure you have your pet's medications (if
applicable) on hand.

It's also a good idea to hit the bank and pull out some cash to keep
on hand.  Cash comes in handy during emergencies, and the ATM's may be
out of service following a storm.  After Katrina hit in Louisiana, I
worked at Lowes and we lost the ability to process credit-debit cards
for a few days after the storm.  The local businesses that were open
immediately following the storm were taking cash only.

If you evacuate, make sure you have a full tank of gas and an empty
bladder.  A full gas can or two in the trunk or back of the truck is a
good idea also.  A lot of gas stations along a major evacuation route
will be sold out gas.  And you will be sitting at idle and a lot of
stop-n-go bumper to bumper traffic.  If your vehicle is not reliable,
find an alternative.  Do not attempt to evacuate in an unreliable car
- you'll find yourself stranded on the side of the road with many
other unlucky motorists with stalled vehicles.

Best regards,

MikeG
