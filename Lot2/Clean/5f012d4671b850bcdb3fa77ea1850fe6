I agree,  I use lubuntu now however,  but was it a mistake per se,?   by
releasing early it got out to the masses, which meant the developers got
feedback which led to improvements,   it was more a gamble,  end of the
day,   you have choice,  

I also agree that unity has come on a lot in recent months,
