I still think it was a clear foul in the box.  I didn't see it as that in real time, as I thought it was just bad marking-but it was a clear separation created by a good old two handed push to the back.  As to the look on Suarez's face, I think it was that he turned to look and see if he's got away with it, and when he spies that he did he punches the air.  (I think by now he would know he has no friends, though the documentary 'Being Liverpool' suggests otherwise.

Actually we still do from time to time,-not very much though, and mostly it is Cole, and it's the back post-though sometimes Cech moves him forward.

You've just reminded me what I noticed the other week too. We no longer put men on posts at corners.
