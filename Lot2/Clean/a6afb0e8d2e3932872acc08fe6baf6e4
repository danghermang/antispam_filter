Subject:[child_lit] Kid-Lit Cares
I want to let everybody know about a child-lit related disaster relief
effort I just learned about. Author Kate Messner is conducting an auction
for a long and varied list of child-lit related goodies (signed books,
manuscript critiques, author visits, etc.) with proceeds going to the Red
Cross disaster relief fund.
