Subject:[Birding-Aus] RFI White-browed Crake and Mangrove Golden Whistler
 Cairns and surrounds

Hi All,

Peter and I are off up to Cairns, Port Douglas, Julatten for the eclipse and to pick up some more lifers for Peter.  Has anyone got any sites up there for the White-browed Crake and Mangrove Golden Whistler?  Has the Crocodile farm opened again??

Thanks 

Judith
