Subject:Re: [Chelsea] CPO Share Application Form
Almost ashamed to admit this but:
The only thing I have signed by a Chelsea player, is a match ticket, to a game I didn't see. I helped a friend to get a ticket to a game, and to thank me he had the ticket signed and framed, and gave it to me.
It is signed by Enrique de Lucas.
