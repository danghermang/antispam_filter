Congrats to N1 and Brien, Jason and now Bob!  So very cool to have another 
fall in my one-hour-away backyard.  Who else???  (It's remarkable how much 
this one really does look like asphault....) I'll be back soon, and hope to 
run ito whoever is out here...somehow.

Good fortune to all!!!
Richard (Rick Bob) Montgomery
