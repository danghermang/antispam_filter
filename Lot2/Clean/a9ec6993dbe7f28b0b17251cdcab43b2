Subject:[Chelsea] Lineup this evening
Whenever I comment before a game, I'm always proven wrong, so here we go again.

With the midfield chosen for today, I would have retained Mikel and Ramires as the withdrawn pair, and played Frank in an offensive role. I think Frank is still a good football player, but that his qualities are not utilised properly in the slightly defensive position. And I don't think Ramires is at his best on the wing.

So, I predict both of those to have poor games today.
