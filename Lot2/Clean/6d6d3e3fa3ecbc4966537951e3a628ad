Patrick, I use a diluted floor stripper such as Zep or similar. I mix it on=
e part stripper to 3-4 parts hot water.

Apply it with a spray bottle. Some areas will need more strength so I keep =
a separate sprayer with full-strength stripper.=A0 A cup of full strength a=
nd a paint brush id useful along with a small scrub brush.

Be aware that this stripper is not harmful to plastic, but will sometimes f=
ade paint and can in certain cases etch both glass and aluminum.=20

Rinse thoroughly with -hot- water but be careful of plastics.

Blow dry with a vacuum cleaner used as blower. I keep an Electrolux with cl=
ean hose for this purpose.

Amps and selection receivers are also washed but care should be taken to ke=
ep stripper and most water out of coils and transformers.

In the case of that Wurlitzer mech --Do not disassemble more than absolutel=
y necessary.--

I remove:=A0 Arch-dress-tonearm-all motors and pin memory.

When washing the selector buttons be careful about the stripper getting und=
er the clear cover of the keys.=A0 If it gets in there you will have to use=
 extra effort to flush it out because it will emulsify the gunk under there=
 and make it streak.=A0=A0=A0 I do wash that area but bear in mind that is =
going to be a bit of a pain sometimes.

Stripper can also be used for the cabinet but may damage the side coating, =
though they may be in bad shape already. Spray it onto the front screen and=
 work with a scrub brush. Obviously you will have removed the speakers.=20

Be careful of the screened graphics on the done glass.

I have completely dismantled my Wurlitzer 2410 and now ready to do cleaning
and adjustments. What is best method/solvent to use for this cleaning? And
do I need to disassemble the shaft with cams and lifting arm mechanism to d=
o
this cleaning? It looks dangerous to disassemble this shaft.
