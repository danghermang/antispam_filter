Ron, the Singing Dogs have been in every machine every Christmas, whether t=
he location owner likes it or not, since each installation was made.

I remember in fall 1988 the first Christmas for this location here on the e=
ast side. When i played the dogs right after putting them in, two of the Me=
xican workers stopped in their tracks and listened with a contemplative loo=
k on their faces.=A0 Rufuvio said "perros!"=A0 I cruelly broke the spell by=
 saying "anyone you know?"

That and the Chipmunks are the first things they ask about each year.

i love Mexicans.

Rob,
If you want to "add to the fun" (which you guys sure need now) find a copy =
of the "Singing Dogs" -- "Jingle Bells", and I also attempt to find new/old=
 "Spike Jones" stuff--this gets lotsa complaints from the location staff (o=
h, yea, I also dis-able the external "reject" buttons)--but also lotsa play=
s !=A0 Ron Rich=20

Yep, that is the scenario that makes the most sense.

Christmas music is not the great seller that is was 20+ years ago.=A0 This =
city has become much more diverse racially/ethnically, then add the fact th=
at at least one major radio station will go 'all Christmas" beginning the F=
riday before thanksgiving and you can see the main reasons for the loss of =
interest.

The way it plays out: After an initial spurt of interest when the music is =
put in (50-75 titles) it goes down and picks up again a few days before Chr=
istmas.=A0=A0=20

Then in typical American style, right after the 25th, interest dies off alm=
ost completely and the music is essentially deadwood.

It's really a lot of work for little added return, but it adds to the fun o=
f the season.

Rob

Thomas, staff in my locations began to ask about when they'll get Christmas=
 music as soon as September began.

I gave them the same answer some have heard for over twenty years; "first c=
ollection after Thanksgiving".
