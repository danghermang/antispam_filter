Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Barrington Tops NSW (road status?) UPDATE
Thank you Alan (Mick and Jim).
=A0
I just called the caravan park as suggested.
=A0
I was advised by a helpful gentleman that the road is open however there is=
 currently a fire=A0 at Sharpes Creek just inside the border of the Nationa=
l Park that may cause issues in the surrounding area and potentially stop a=
ccess to the Park.
=A0
He said it is extremely dry in the area.

We are in for a hot summer!

Cheers,
Charles

I'm not 100% sure if the Gloucester NPWS office will be all that up to date=
 about the status of the road repair. The repair job is not their direct re=
sponsibility.=A0 My suggestion is to call the commercial caravan park which=
 is located just before the entrance to the National Park. They are probabl=
y much more likely to have a handle on how the repairs are progressing, see=
ing as it directly impacts to their business.=A0 Their number is (02) 6558 =
3155.

Hi Charles,

Jim is correct in that the major slip has been fixed but there appears to b=
e a "new" issue now. I do not have first hand experience with this but here=
 is some text from an email that Alan Stuart sent to the Hunterbirding chat=
 group on the 23rd Oct.
The concrete pavement at one of the fords on the road in (Gloucester Tops R=
d) has collapsed (this problem has been in process for some time, and there=
 has been a warning sign up at the ford for ages). The road is closed. Acce=
ss to the Tops is possible but involves taking the Flood Detour=A0 which yo=
u get to by heading 1.9km beyond the usual turn-off.=A0 It is a very windin=
g road over the tree-bare hilltops, with 5 gates to negotiate (all of them =
are on steep hills=A0 you need a good handbrake!).=A0 I saw just 4 species =
while traversing it i.e. it is a bleak, barren area to drive through.
The sign advising about the roadworks indicated that the road would be clos=
ed from 22 October to 9 November. If anyone goes to the Tops after that dat=
e, perhaps you can advise us about the status of it?

Maybe Alan can expand, but more likely your best bet is to call the parks o=
ffice in Gloucester.

Mick

Hello Charles,

The land slip that required the Gloucester Tops road to be closed has been =
repaired.
The road is now suitable for any vehicle all the way to Gloucester Falls an=
d to the
start of the Carey's Peak walking track.
