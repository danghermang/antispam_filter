Subject:[Antenna-discussion] Another Crystal Radio Question
This is probably not fitting into the crystal radio topic presently
being discussed so I'll list it separately:

If a one watt AM transmitter is being received on a nearby crystal
radio at comfortable headphone listening level - (let's call that
1/50th of a watt going into the headphones, if that's a reasonable
estimate) - What happens if 51 or more nearby crystal radios are
listening?  Surely the total power output of all the crystal radios
can't exceed the transmitted power!  I once asked a similar question
here, but must confess to not understanding how this works.
