I use the Yamaha CM500 recommended on this list (headset and boom 
mic, about $50) and it works a treat.  Be sure to put a couple of 
ferrites around the audio input to the F3K to kill any RF picked up 
in the wire.   You need to make your own adaptor to the RJ45 on the 
front panel for the mic/headset/ptt switch.

There is another headset, highly recommended, using a OVL750MV 
headset with boom mic, that includes all the cable wiring done for 
you.  It is sold by someone on the list, but I can't remember who.
