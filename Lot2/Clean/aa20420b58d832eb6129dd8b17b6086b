Hi Michael,

Thank you for stepping up on some difficult issues and providing good input=
 however I pay a much higher tax rate on meteorite sales.

The short-term and long-term capitol gains rate on meteorites are 28% becau=
se they fall under collectables like Gold, Platinum and Silver now do.=A0=
=A0 Then another 15% has to be added for FICA which is taxed before Net Ope=
rating Losses (NOL).=A0 28% plus 15% equals a tax rate of 43% on realized p=
rofits squeezing dealers pretty hard. In Arizona and many other states, the=
re is also a state income tax that has to be taken into account.=A0 Meteori=
tes fall under the highest capitol gains rate.


I wouldn't be complaining at all if it were only 15% like other investments=
.=A0 Taxes have become very confusing.


Take Care,

Adam

it is only taxed if sold, wait a year and it is 15%. No gain like that can =
be taxed unless sold as there is no actual provable value.
