Subject:[Flexradio] Using both VAC1 and 2 on Flex3K?
 I would like to run CWSkimmer, which uses I/Q to VAC, and JT65HF,
which does NOT use I/Q to VAC, at the same time. It seems that I could
use one VAC for each of the applications, but how do I configure that?
Is it possible at all? Right now I have to go into setup and
mark/unmark the I/Q to VAC box, depending on what application I want
to use.
 Thanks for any hints!Rolf PY1RO
