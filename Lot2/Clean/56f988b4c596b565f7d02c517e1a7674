Subject:Re: [child_lit] Historical fiction
Well it may not matter to the reader but it does, I think, matter to the storytelling. Because when you're writing historical fiction you're gathering your setting intellectually rather than through daily sensory perception, and regardless of how much data there is out there, you're guessing at so much. So the fiction part of historical fiction isn't as neat and clear as one might think. And then there's the author's sensibility, which can bend and become sort of permeable, and try to transmit a suitable narrative voice. I'm thinking of Tobin Anderson reading nothing but 18th century prose while he was writing the Octavian Nothing books. But in the end we're who we are, and the story will carry some of that DNA as well. So yes, I do think there's a difference, but will a pre-teen or teenaged reader get all that? Maybe not, and that doesn't matter at all to me. We all absorb a whole lot more than we realize while we read and I believe this is true of young readers as well. The
  magic of reading for pleasure as a young person lies in part in something yet to come, that life ahead in which you can let it all steep, so in the end it will become part of you.

Whether it's technology or popular culture references, does it matter to the reader or the storytelling if it is a book written as contemporary fiction in 1950, or as historical fiction set in 1950?
