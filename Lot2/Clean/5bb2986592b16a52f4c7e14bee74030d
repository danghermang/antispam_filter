After I add a disclaimer that I don't know very much about both
existing and possible future threats on Linux, nor do I know a great
deal about firewalls, I think that in a home environment, running a
firewall on the router is generally sufficient.

But then, if it doesn't hurt your experience of using the computer, I
don't see why you wouldn't run an internal firewall was well. For one
thing, it does help bad stuff from spreading inside the network.
