Quite a bit of central New Jersey is under-water and power is out throughout a fair part of the state. I know that some of you are receiving annoying and improper emails, for which I am dreadfully sorry, but as unwelcome as this is, it does not rise to the level of magnitude that will concern University personnel right at the moment. If someone would be kind enough to forward one of the emails to me, I will see what I can do to put a stop to them.
