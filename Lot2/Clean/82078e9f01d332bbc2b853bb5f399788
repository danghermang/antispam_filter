Subject:[Birding-Aus] Morcombe App and BirdLog Australia and New Zealand
> Two app questions:
> 
> 1.    I am becoming increasingly frustrated with the instability of the Morcombe field guide app, which for me crashes with monotonous regularity. Have others experienced this problem? I use an app (Birdsight Au) to record my sightings and Morcombe seems to dislike switching between apps. I downloaded the Morcombe app to my iPhone when it was first released, so I have been using it for nearly 2 years.
