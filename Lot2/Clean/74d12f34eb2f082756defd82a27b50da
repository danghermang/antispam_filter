Subject:[Flexradio] PowerSDR on a Mac?
I'm planning on upgrading my computer and getting a Mac Mini (2.5 GHz 
quad core i7, 16 gig RAM).  Does anyone have any experience running 
PowerSDR with Parallels or Fusion 5 on a Mac?

While we're on the subject; is anyone running PowerSDR under Windows 8?  
Any gotchas there too?

Many thanks!
