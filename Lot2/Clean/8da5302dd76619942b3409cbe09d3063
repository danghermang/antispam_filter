-About the cooling problem, and not the *cold* problem  :-)



-----

Peltier.  =

We can find them in all very cheapest of cheap crap car-cooler-boxes. =

With assembly, fans and everything, but you need to have very good insulati=
on as the "box" is so big.

But they are also not good for a large temp diff and can not have high cool=
ing power AND a high diff.. So, it is very bad I would say.
I have seen larger units at very cheap prices, but it is still a crap-solut=
ion, in my opinion.


----


Compressor:
People might want to look in to for example the Danfoss BD-seris, =

small low voltage "DC" compressors with decent eff. runs on 12/24Vdc(or 48V=
) =

and also it can,depending on what drive unit you chose, also be able to run=
 on =

the normal 230Vac,(110 and 240volt in the US?) The drive is an AC-motor inv=
erter =

speed controller inside its electronic module! So maybe it is nice to have =
one that runs on AC when you charge, or just use the dcdc in the car. =


..is high cell temp a problem also when charging NiMh?

NiCd actually get a lot colder if we charge them hard, =

and I dont know anything about large NiMH, but I beleve they are opposite a=
nd will get hot, =

I have never seen a EV-NiMh cell, as they have never been sold here in any =
numbers, due to the GM/chevron/Texaco/cobasys-OIL-"trouble", I suppose.. =




Buy a Compressor?
the cheapest way here is to buy a consumer product, with them already insid=
e..... =

Even with *producer* account, most of the time I can not get them at =

the same price as the ready made food-cooler-boxes here, in high price mari=
ne shops.. (!!)

About 400-500 dollares I guess it will be at your place, for a complete sma=
ll 10-25 liter unit, =

with cap tube already sized, eavaporator and condenser, and the inverter dr=
ive unit.. and the condenser fan..

Probably it is a R134 unit, =

I dont remember but i think that R600 Isobutan might have a bit lower disch=
arge temp at the high condensing/ambient air.(maybe saves your oil from ove=
rheat problem)  and in your case also may be overloaded with all energy fro=
m the higher than normal boiling-temp. (they dont say anything above -5=B4C=
 boil  in the spec I beleve, so probably it is the running maximum. So mayb=
e check with engineering for R600, I guess is BD35KT instead of "F", and ma=
ybe you need a more heavy oil in your hot application, but now I am just gu=
essing here!  The 250GH at R134 would be my choice  :-)  if it exist in 12V=
. If you need even more power use the 350GH)



Pictures of some rack-units, that you also can use, if you can pay  _a lot_=
  Very high prices but see the pictures here:

The AC-drives are for example:
" Danfoss 101N0500 Multivoltage Electronic Controller for BD35 BD50 Compres=
sor
			Danfoss 101N0500 AC/DC Electronic controller for BD35 and BD 50 compress=
ors.
This electronic controller replaces the standard controller on the =

Danfoss DC compressor allowing you to run your 12v/24v fridge or freezer
 from a 110v or 230v AC supply.
The controller has automatic priority switching to AC operation. The =

AC Voltage range is from 85 Volt AC up to 265 Volt AC 50 /60 Hz. The DC =

Voltage range is from 9.6 to 31.5 V DC.http://www.penguinfrigo.co.uk/shop/p=
opup/product/318/
"If BD50 compressor is used, then I think you might be on the limit, guess =
you need a drive inverter for tropical temps. (high start torque)
...Also, the BD35,50,80 is mainly for food cooler and freezers =3D low evap=
 temperatures.
So even if they say low, mid and"high use" you need to have your =

constant running evaporator temp lower than I would prefer  and should =

have choosen in a desertbox that aims for +25=B4C degrees.. =

I am no expert in cooling! But I am almost sure it is not the optimal desig=
n.  =

..and I have never been cooling anything in a dessert.. Actually I have nev=
er seen a desert at all.  :-)

Here in the Example datasheet, it tell you the performances at different sp=
eeds and temperatures:
http://www.ra.danfoss.com/TechnicalInfo/Literature/Manuals/06/Danfoss_bd35f=
_r134a_12-24vdc_09-2011_dehc100d802.pdf
It tell a lot of interesting things. =





More models (and application notes) you should find here:

-Current-Compressors/b44e7573-473b-4dba-90c2-431ffccf0b9c.html

-If money is not an issue, i would look at the bigger BD350GH
It will give you 800W cooling +10=B4C boil  @ 360W consumtion in a 12V syst=
em, =

(choose 24 or 48V for better effi. if you also have this voltages)

----  ONE WILD guess... The AC-input module may be able to run at your syst=
em pack voltage... ! -----

Maybe use the smaller BD250GH, but i dont know if there is a 12V model.
250GH will give about 400W cooling from 200W power(+fans) @ 10=B4C evap. =

Both 250 and 350 should be ok to run at +15=B4C boil. But i think that is a=
bout maximum, and you need to keep condensing temp down..
(all in ASHRAE : Condensing temperature : 54.4=B0C /  Ambient temperature :=
 32=B0C (in a dessert I guess you need to take extra steps for a ready made=
 rack unit to keep condesing temp down, so the pressure and oil temp keep b=
elow danger temp. As a rule of thumb..high temp in discharge gas will break=
 down your oil, and then break down your kompressor.. Higher condenser temp=
s will also make it eat more Amps =3D hot windings in motor..)    / Suction=
 gas temperature : 32=B0C / Liquid temperature : 32=B0C )

Yes I found some boxes now at pages in your language:
http://www.adventurerv.net/dometic-coolfreeze-portable-refrigerator-freezer=
-cf25-cf025dc-p-1227.html  =

409 usd  , a BD50 kompressor or maybe BD35  I guess. =


http://www.progressivemed.com/estylez_item.aspx?item=3D11600
315 usd,  I guess BD35F compressor and R134A gas. =

But what if.....? =

..if any of you live where you have really hot, but also DRY air? =3D a ver=
y low RH?
Then I would suggest to look at and build something that runs on small sola=
r power for the car.
Evap cooler is the id=E9a!  (well,..if you have water.)
When moving you dont even need a fan  and when standing still parked, it ca=
n be self-powered with less energy needed than a compressor unit.

If you like to, you can make it with an exchanger-design so you dont need t=
o feed new air whith higher RH in to the batterybox, as it probably can be =
condensing problem.
(same problem must be possible if you use the hot high RH cabin air, and it=
 goes down and condensate at a cold battery)


If you have very dry air it can have a pretty good cooling effect without a=
 compressor A/C,  =

You probably need a small pump, but it can even be made without pump. =

CPU-fan may be enough airspeed over the moist surface?  =

But if you have between 81-100 % RH as we have here in Sweden now..dont exp=
ect it to work.  :-)

A Home built, simple to understand cooler, but without heat exchanger, look=
 at this movie:

Maybe this calculator can help some to calculate the temperatures possible:

If you are prepared to go for high end "space"-age-things =

and need a very high detlaT..  =

-Try the USA-style of beer cooler!  :-) =


About 10 years ago, i found a source for engines/cooler when we needed ultr=
a low evap temp
 at -60 degrees C or lower and the condensing side was at tropical temperat=
ures, not even our 2 stage compressor did the job well..
Then I finally found small units at decent price, =

in beer coolers..! hehe.  but I never used one. =

Wow..long mail, sorry,  hehe, =

I hope it will help someone to get new mad(?) ideas.  :-)
