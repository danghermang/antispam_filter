Subject:Re: [burners] OT: Kickstarter for LED spinning props
i'm also working on something like this, although i'm starting with a staff
with the goal of making poi next.

also, abe has said pretty much exactly what i was going to say - the LED
system is pretty easy, it's making something that will hold all the parts
and isn't going to fall apart (or explode, or shock you, or embed sharp
metal bits in your leg, or or or) the first time you drop it that's hard.
