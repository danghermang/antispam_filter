Subject:Re: [EVDL] Advancing Motor Timing pros/cons/ accel efficiency
The 2400lb 37 Jaguar also suffers excessive arcing, (especially at lower
rpm's) and high heat on the highway.  ADC 8", 100v.  Looses power after
3000rpm.  If I change the timing for better low-end then the power will cut
out even sooner.  I think the bottom line is More voltage and More motor.
 I thought maybe upgrading to a Warp 9 would do it, but seems you are
suffering the same fate with higher voltage and larger/better motor.  I
upgraded the brushes, but that only helped a little...
