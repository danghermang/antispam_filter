Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] crystal radios and the capture area paradox

Back in the 1970's the FCC in the USA published rules about how audio =

amplifier manufacturers could make claims about the power output of =

their products.
And the requirement was that RMS power per channel with all channels =

fully driven with a sinusoidal wave form was the only claim allowed. =

Anything that follows a sinusoidal wave form has an r.m.s. measurement.
