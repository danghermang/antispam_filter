This is a link to a 'Vehicle Energy Use Simulator'. You can put in lots of
different parameters, any kind of fuel, electric only also, the type of car,
wind simulator with energy usage showing how the wind actually impacts MPG. =


It is available at the MacStore, so I guess that it is Mac only.

Any takers?
