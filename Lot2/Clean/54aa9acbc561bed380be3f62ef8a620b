Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Alan, and Alan,

These things were commented on during the past emails, and were added to my 
tech note
http://puhep1.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/power.pdf

To recapitulate (and to give somewhat greater detail):

We first introduce the notion of the effective permeability of the rod as 
follows.

If the loop/coil, of area A, is in a uniform external field B (perp to the 
plane of the loop), the magnetic flux thru the loop/coil is
Phi_0 = B A           -- if no ferrite.

When the ferrite is added, the flux thru the loop/coil increases to a larger 
value Phi,

We define the effective permeability of the ferrite, mu_eff, as
mu_eff = Phi / Phi_0.

An immediate consequence is that if the external field is oscillating, the 
open-circuit voltageV_oc  (at a small gap somewhere in the loop/coil), which 
is proportional to the magnetic flux times the oscillation frequency, goes 
up by
mu_eff.

V_oc_rod = mu_eff V_oc_no_rod

In general, mu_eff is less than the (relative) permeability mu of the 
material of the rod.  Only for an infinitely long rod does
mu_eff_long rod = mu.
At the other extreme, if the "rod" is just a thin disc that fits inside the 
loop,
mu_eff_disk = 1.

--------------------
Meanwhile, Radiation resistance (of any "magnetic" antenna) is proportional 
to the square of the magnetic moment (of the antenna system).

If the loop/coil has no ferrite its magnetic moment is just
m_0 = N I A
when the loop, of N turns, carries current I.

When a ferrite rod is introduced inside the loop, it takes on a magnetic 
moment= m_rod.   The total magnetic moment is
m = m_0 + m_rod.

The magnetic moment of the rod is the integral of the magnetization density 
M inside the rod
m_rod = int M dVol

The magnetization density M is related by
M = (mu - 1)H
where mu is the relative permeability of the rod.

In case of a very long rod of length d, Ampere's law tell us that
H d = N I
when the loop carries current I.

The magnetic moment of the rod is
m_rod = int M dVol
    = H d A
    = (mu - 1) N I A
    = (mu - 1) m_0.

At the other extreme, for a thin disk, the volume is zero, and
m_rod = 0

So the total magnetic moment is
m = m_0 + m_rod = mu m_0        for very long rod
                               = m_0             for rod = disk

In general, m = mu_eff m_0

The above argument does not strictly prove that the mu_eff used here is the 
same as the mu_eff used before when considering the increase in "captured" 
flux when the rod was added --- but they are the same.

So, Rrad ~ m^2 ~  (mu_eff)^2

-----------------
Hence, IF the antenna could be matched with R = Rrad,
then
V_oc^2 /Rrad = power received by the antenna
is the same with and without the rod.

Since Rrad is very small for a small loop/coil, this ideal result is hard to 
achieve in practice -- and could be achieved only for a system with an 
extremely small bandwidth.     A superconducting loop antenna, however, can 
be built with Rload = Rrad.    This was first done in 1969:
http://puhep1.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/EM/walker_jap_40_2035_69.pdf

----------------
The last step in the argument concerns the inductance
L = flux thru loop/coil / I
when the loop/coil carries current I.

With no ferrite,  a coil of length d_coil that carries current I has
H = N I / d_coil
B = mu_0 N I /d_coil
flux = N B A / d_coil
       = mu_0 N^2 A I / d_coil
so
L_0 = mu_0 N^2 A / d_coil.

When a rod of length d is added, H changes as discussed before, so that the 
inductance increases by
a factor of mu, to mu L_0, for very long rod, but stays at L_0 for a thin 
disk.

In general,
L = mu_eff L_0
where mu_eff is the same quantity as appears in the expression for Rrad. 
As before, we claim that this is the same mu_eff as appears in the 
discussion of "capturing" flux from an external magnetic field.

Reminder:
V_oc = mu_eff V_oc_0

Rrad = mu^eff^2 Rrad_0

--Kirk

PS    The practical challenge is to evaluate mu_eff for "short" rods of 
arbitrary length d and area A, and for arbitrary intrinsic (relative) 
permeability mu.

This is complicated, and no simple formula applies for all values of d/A and 
mu.

Alan P's "theory" is just a new formula that applies for some range of 
values of these parameters.

Yes the radiation resistance increases by 25^2. As for the inductance, this 
increases by about the same amount, and I give accurate equations in my 
article 'The Inductance of Ferrite Rod Antennas', antennex, July 2011.
On reflection there is clearly a close relationship between the gain of the 
ferrite to an EM wave and the increase in inductance, and it is on my to-do 
list, when I get some time.
