Chelsea will step up security for Wednesday's sellout Capital One Cup
tie with Manchester United following Sunday's explosive events.

Staff from Servoca Security and Premier Events, who provide matchday
stewards at Stamford Bridge, will be given enhanced safety briefings
before the match.

On Sunday a steward from Premier Events was taken to hospital after
being flipped over a safety barrier in the Matthew Harding stand when
United scored the winner.

He spent 45 minutes being treated for a knee injury by paramedics by the
side of the field and was taken to hospital after the game.

He has since been released but police and Chelsea are investigating the
disgraceful incident.

A seat was ripped out and thrown from the Matthew Harding Stand and
directed at United players celebrating Javier Hernandez's winner.

Coins were also used as missiles by Chelsea fans and they are also the
subject of an ongoing investigation after a shocking day for football.

Tensions between the two clubs are running high after Sunday's explosive
Barclays Premier League clash between the two teams.

Referee Mark Clattenburg has been accused of racially abusing John Obi
Mikel and Juan Mata claims the official called him 'a Spanish t***'.

Both securities companies have refused to comment.

Harry
