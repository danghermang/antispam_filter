Subject:Re: [child_lit] middle grade novels
I really like the girl athlete/bully character in DONUTHEAD

If you aren't looking specifically for girl protagonists, THE POWER OF UN is a great 4th-6th grade book. So is THE GOLLYWHOPPER GAMES.

Lisa Yee always has interesting characters, both boys and girls.

Has anyone mentioned Karen Hesse's book DOLPHIN MUSIC?
