my understanding is that if it was piracy issues the ISP would have to 
send letters, though not even sure this is implemented. On porn, well 
50% of net access is used for porn... And if he's downloaded a gizzilion 
GB, it the shutdown request would probably be from the ISP.

The only sugestion I can offer is that I once made an enquiry with BT 
and about a month later when I got round to opening a letter (I thought 
is was junk mail) from o2, my ISP, discovered I was about to be 
disconnected in 3 days time as I was going with another provider. The 
enquiry to BT was just that, an enquiry (about the phone line, which o2 
provide). The person at o2 said this often happens when people ask BT 
about services. So it could be something like this.
