Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] Meteorites of North Carolina
Hello All,

It's been a while since I've visited the Meteorite List.  
I'm glad to see it's going strong...

I will be offering a course in Meteorites here at Duke in January.
I've wanted to do this for a while and now it's on the books!

If anyone can help me acquire some samples of any of the 29 meteorites
from NC, please let me know.  I'd like to have some on hand to show to
my students.  

It's been close to 80 years since anyone has come across a meteorite
in North Carolina.  If we are lucky, we can update the listings for that
state.

Thanks,
Nick
