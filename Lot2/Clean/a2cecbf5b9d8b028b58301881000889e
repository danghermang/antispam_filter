Subject:Re: [child_lit] younger reader/MG titles with girl protagonists?
Hi, Kerry!

You have hit upon a topic near and dear to my heart.

1. Ingrid Law's SAVVY is probably exactly what you're looking for. I love
that book.

2. Of course Philip Pullman's instant-classic HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy
totally fits the bill, especially the first one in the series since it
focuses exclusively on Lyra. His earlier Victorian novels (RUBY IN THE
SMOKE, etc.) work too, but I think those are more than ten years old. Still
worth considering. I loved them. The third one gets political in a way I
liked, if I remember correctly.

3. Blue Balliett's CHASING VERMEER has a great appealing girl
co-protagonist that doesn't "go crazy with the gendering," as you say.

4. Frances Hardinge has similarly appealing and distinctive and not
annoyingly gendered heroines, particularly in FLY BY NIGHT and THE LOST
CONSPIRACY.

5. I'm sure I need hardly mention Miranda from Rebecca Stead's
(richly-deserved) Newbery winning WHEN YOU REACH ME.

6. If you want to branch out to sci-fi graphic novels, Ben Hattke's ZITA
THE SPACEGIRL is pure enjoyment with a great heroine.

7. Laini Taylor's BLACKBRINGER features the kind of heroine you're after,
but only if you're into fierce faeries. That's a hard sell for some, though
it wasn't for me.

8. You can't go wrong with Neil Gaiman's CORALINE.

9. And finally -- dare I say this? dang the torpedoes, I shall -- THE ORDER
OF ODD-FISH by yours truly may just well past muster on your
appealing-but-not-annoyingly-gendered-heroine criteria.

I look forward to seeing what recommendations pop up in this discussion. I
have an affinity for this kind of book. And with a 3-year-old daughter and
a 1-year-old daughter, I'd better get cracking stocking my library with
such titles!

Best,

James
