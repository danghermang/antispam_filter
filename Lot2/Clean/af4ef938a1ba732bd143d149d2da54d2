Stephen, this is a reply post for the same problem on my W3000. I could
not get the arms to retract using the motor, but I did get them retracted
by turning the main cam as stated by Shankar. Hope this helps. newtjr

Shankar, I did what you said, turned the main cam and arms are retracted.
Still have a problem: now when I make a selection it sets a pin but does
not contiune from there. Have not had much time this week. Will do more
checking on weekend. Thanks, newtjr

Needle brush adjustments according to the manual should not affect the
record changer operation.

>From my recent experience with a W2900 it was possible for the mech to
get stuck between the play/transfer states. I also found that manually
turning the changer motor did not always help.


What i would try -
WITH POWER OFF!

I would try turning the main cam with both hands until the lift arm
returns to the rest position. Care must be taken not to release the cam
until the lift arm is completely retracted, else the lift arm can spring
up from the tension of the long spring. Assistance can also be sought to
hold down BOTH lift arms during the attempt, to prevent either from
springing up.

Once completely retracted, the record carrier should be free to turn by hand.

With power ON, scanning should resume when a selector pin is raised.

Shankar Singh

I have a Wurlitzer 3000 (200 play) that developed a problem after I made a
minor adjustment on the needle brush. It now has the record at the
turntable but not clamped. The tone arm is in the non play position.The
"record fan' safety switch is not tripped. I tried to reject the record,
but no response.The turntable release cam (item #20, figure 56 page 24) is
in the non play position. The mute/play switch is in the non play
position. The transfer switch is in the transfer position. I have checked
all fuses (ohm meter) and are ok. It seem like it may have have got "out
of time" if that is possible. I do have a manual. Thanks in advance for
any help.
