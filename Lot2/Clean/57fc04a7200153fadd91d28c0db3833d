Subject:Re: [CT Birds] Malicious Links on CT Digest
John,

Yes, starting Monday there has been a string of infected users on the list,=
 among them myself.  Mine was probably the worst of them because it went ou=
t to everyone on the daily report along with everywhere else.  (I have reas=
on to believe that mine only got up to D in my address book, so it could ha=
ve been even worse.)

When account is compromised in this way I put it on Review status in CTBird=
s.  That means any post by that person has to sit and wait for me to manual=
ly check it out and make sure it is not another spam.  Note that, because I=
 was one of those infected, I have put MYSELF on review status along with t=
he rest of those afflicted.  (I even had to put myself on review for the Da=
ily, and that is even worse to work around when I make the post each night.)

The rule I try to follow comes in two parts.  First, never click on anythin=
g that is even the least bit suspicious.  Second, be VERY, VERY SUSPICIOUS!=
!!  Any email with no text but a link should be ignored.  Any email where t=
he text something simpleminded like "check this out" should be ignored.  An=
y link that does not include a clear statement of what an included link is =
for and why it coming to you should be ignored.  Just because you trust the=
 person is no reason to trust their email!!!

If you do seem to be infected the FIRST thing to do is CHANGE YOUR EMAIL PA=
SSWORD.  Following that up with a good virus scan makes a lot of sense too,=
 though when I scanned after my infection it found nothing.

Be careful out there.
