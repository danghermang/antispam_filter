Subject:[burners] Knitting needles
Hey folks,
Just as I thought my knitting days were long past, I suffered a mohair
windfall and am practically swimming in a steamer trunk full of it (woot!).
 I know enough not to let this stuff go to waste, but I gave away virtually
all of my knitting supplies long ago.  I was wondering if anyone in the
neighborhood had some stuff they'd be happy to lend out for awhile (promise
I'll replace if something happens).

I'd happily extend something of equal or greater use (like my Viking sewing
machine), or tasty edibles, Thai massage, yoga assists, take you to some
awesome urban ruins, or other.

I would need...

1 24-inch US #17/12 mm circular needle
1 24 inch US #11/8mm circular needle
1 24-inch US #6/ 4mm circular needle
1 32 inch US #8/5mm circular needle
1 32 inch US #11/8mm circular needle

1 set US #11/8mm double-point needles

1 pair 5mm / US #8 needles

Crochet hook, close in size to US G/6 / 4mm

Those would cover about 5-6 different patterns I'm interested in, so even a
couple of needles off of their would be fine.  I apologize for putting this
out on the list, I hate the accumulation of stuff and try to avoid it
whenever possible and certainly know I have fed many a knitting needle into
the system.

Best,
