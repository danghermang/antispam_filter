[HS: Please, God]

By Paul Hetherington

CHELSEA will have to offer Fernando Torres back to Atletico Madrid to clinch
the signing of Radamel Falcao.

The Champions League winners are tracking =A345million-rated Falcao.

But the Daily Star Sunday has been told that the Spanish club would prefer a
deal which would see them re-sign Torres as a ready-made replacement.

Torres, 28, made his name at Atletico before moving to Liverpool, from where
he made a sensational =A350m switch to Chelsea.

Atletico have also been eyeing Manchester United's Javier Hernandez as a
potential replacement for Colombian hit-man Falcao.

But they are now talking about a reunion with Torres, who scored 75 goals in
174 league appearances for the club.

Falcao's scoring exploits for the Spanish side have made him one of the
most-wanted players in the world.

And Chelsea know they face fierce competition to land him from big-spending
Paris St-Germain - managed by former Stamford Bridge boss Carlo Ancelotti -
and Manchester City.

But they would move into pole position if they were prepared to include
Torres in the deal.

And the Spain striker, of course, would also have to agree to a return to
Madrid, where he was known as El Nino - which means The Kid.

Torres left his boyhood club for Anfield in a =A320m switch in the summer of
2007 and was an instant hit with the Reds, netting 24 league goals in his
first season.

He joined Chelsea in January 2011 but has failed to recapture his early form
with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge.

Harry
