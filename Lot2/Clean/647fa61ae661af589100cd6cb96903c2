Subject:[CT Birds] Hammo in the rain
I made a quick visit to Hammonasset at midday today.  About 45 White-winged Crossbills were in the pines at the West Beach pavilion with about a dozen Red-breasted Nuthatches and finally, a male and female Red Crossbill. The Common Black-headed Gull was ina small puddle at the East Beach pavilion and numerous Northern Gannets were offshore with the surprise of the day, a Royal Tern off the Meigs jetty
