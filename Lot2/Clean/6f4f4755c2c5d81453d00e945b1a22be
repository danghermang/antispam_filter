Subject:[Jukebox-list] eBay sale--again
Hi All,
Item #=A0 221148855368, on eBay is listed as "original". This is far from t=
he truth.
I was asked last time I posted something like this--"why post it"?
The reason is simple--I have seen/heard this way too often--and I really do=
n't like it.=20
I don't know if this seller knows, or does not know, what the truth is, but=
 I believe anyone considering purchasing it should know prior to making an =
offer.
Some of the "non-original" things that I spotted--cabinet colors, speaker b=
oard cloth,=20
"PRVC" control head attached to the rear ( leads one to think that the wron=
g amp is installed, as the original amp does not work with this item) ? Ton=
e arm has been changed to late style (GREAT-- IMHO, if done right !) --"Pri=
cing window" is incorrect (even if the phono is set as shown), and the"mech=
anism cover" is incorrect for this model.
