Subject:[Dixielandjazz] Kid Thomas
At tonight's jazz evening, our host played a record issued as "Alonzo
Stewart featuring Kid Thomas and His Algiers Stompers," on the Maison
Bourbon" label.  In addition to the regulars, it also features Paul
Barnes on clarinet.  Short biograhies of members (excluding Kid Thomas
himself) are given in the notes, but not the recording date.  since
there is no applause, it must be a studio session.
I failed to find the record on the internet.
Could anybody help?
Cheers
