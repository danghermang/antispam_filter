Hi Richard,

I've been using my 5000A for a couple of years now with my XP core2duo from
Dell and I have it a fully automated system with an Alpha amp, antenna
switching, SteppIR antenna and rotor all being controlled by the flex and
DDUtil....

So far I have had very few computer problems but, I know what you mean about
having second thoughts some times; like when I have to wait a couple of
minutes for the PC to boot up before I can run the radio....  But after all
has been said and done it=92s the best receiver I have ever used and DX
chasing is more fun now than ever before.

So, I have thought of going to one of the big box radios but no joy, none of
them have the real time panadapter and so on....

Have fun with what ever you choose....  buy the way I have a 6500 on
order....

I'm in a quandary. I've been having trouble for some time now running my
flex5KA under windows on my iMac (under Boot Czmp). I've been unable over
the course of several weeks to fix the BSOD problem which came about
shortly after the upgrade to 2.4.4 So I have several choices and would like
your input.

1. Buy a new windows only computer - which off the shelf model are you
using successfully? I'm also considering one of Neal's.

2. Pay for tech support to try and remotely fix my problem and stick with
my iMac.

3. Get out of the SDR business all together and sell my flex as I've become
a bit jaded with radios that are computer dependent. On the other hand it's
established an expectation that will be hard to match.

What would you do? I'd be grateful for suggestions and computer
recommendations.
Tnx
Rick
