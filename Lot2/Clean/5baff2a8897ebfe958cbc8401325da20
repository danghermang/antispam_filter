Subject:AW: [Jukebox-list] AMI paint code 1957 1958
Hello Berry,

thanks for your kind words about the "Multi-Horn"- glasses we made.
We are trying since a few years to make the large very top glasses from =
real glass too and are actually pretty close.
Right now we are working on very nice glasses made from 5 mm perspex. =
The first ones came out nice.
We still need time to cut and paint them but hope to be able to offer =
them within this year.
After we finished the plastic ones we will continue with the real glass =
ones.

Kind regards   -   Oliver Stamann

Roy,

I don't believe anyone is reproducing the top dome valance in glass, it =
can
though be acquired in plastic.  Regarding the front glass marquee that
says, "Multi Horn High Fidelity" these are being perfectly reproduced in
glass by Jukebox World.  They are of tremendous quality.
