It is possible that with mass manufacturing the electric drivetrain might be able to be produced for less than an ICE drivetrain as they are potentially of simpler design which might offset some cost but I'm not sure there is enough of a potential cost savings there to offset the battery premium you have to pay, and I don't think you will ever be able to produce a battery pack for the same cost as a tin can full of air :)

Well now; I wouldn't say that... It *is* possible to make and sell EVs 
for less than ICEs.

As I recall, the 1974 CitiCar was the cheapest car in America when it 
came out. This remained true throughout its gestation, ending with the 
ComutaCar in 1980.
