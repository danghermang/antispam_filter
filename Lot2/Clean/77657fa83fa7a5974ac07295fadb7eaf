Subject:Re: [MG] (proposal) Metagov as a technical plug-in framework
I think I really like this idea, though I don't 100% understand it. Michael, I'll try to provide my own answers to Mark's and Ronal's objections, and you please tell me if I got it right. :)

Mark, I don't think Michael's offering a technological foundation as much as a showcase. At this stage, he's not suggesting a strong linkage between projects, but rather a way for people to "shop" them and see how different ones perform in different scenarios. As part of that, he's also not suggesting Votorola be a foundation but rather just one of those showcased tools.

Ronald, I think Michael's approach is not perfect, but compare it to the present, where we have tools scattered all over the net with no real basis for comparison. If you want to explore several, you need to invest a lot of time and effort, and your comparison will ultimately be apples to oranges, since the tools are running in such different ways. Michael's proposal provides a much easier way to look at tools, and it also provides an imperfect but excellent start toward some deeper level of harmony.

Michael, what would be involved in firing this up, and do you think this would be a good time to finally move the Metagov site off my own hosted site and onto the latent Tuxfamily site we have waiting for us? (Currently resting at http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org but the domain can certainly move there.)
