Subject:[meteorite-list] Video - Manchester Meteorite Day
Hi list,

Martin Goff has already posted some nice photos of our fun day last weekend, when he, I and Graham Ensor displayed two tables worth of our collections to the public. 

I've created a short video of our setup, which captures the buzz of the day. There is also an 'identify the meteorite' freeze frame in the vid which you might find fun to have a go at!

Cheers,
