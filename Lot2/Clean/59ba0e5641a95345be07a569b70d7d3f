Subject:[Chelsea] Players fearing a ref backlash over Mikel race case as
	Clattenburg stood down [Mail]
[HS: We've heard numerous times from "sources" that refs are considering
boycotting CFC. It's just struck me that this is actually proof that
they're bent. That is, deciding issues, in advance off-pitch, that
affect how they approach future games or teams]

Chelsea stars fear a backlash from referees over their race abuse claims
against Mark Clattenburg, who was on Monday removed from the match list
for a second week.

Players fear the case could result in unwelcome tension between
themselves and officials as they battle for the Barclays Premier League
title.

John Mikel Obi=92s agent John Shittu flew into London on Monday as the
FA=92s governance team began taking recorded statements from players.

Chelsea=92s external legal team were also present after Mikel was asked
whether he wanted them to pursue a case against Clattenburg with the FA,
as the club prepare for another lengthy spell in the spotlight.

The European champions face Shakhtar Donetsk at Stamford Bridge on
Wednesday night and have picked up only one point from their last two
Premier League matches.

Shittu confirmed he was at Stamford Bridge for the specially-arranged
meeting with the FA and Chelsea over the allegations against
Clattenburg.

The FA=92s head of compliance Jenni Kennedy took statements, but Chelsea
are taking no chances after her role in the John Terry affair.

She recorded Terry=92s statement in October 2011, but bizarrely only took
handwritten notes of Ashley Cole=92s evidence, a fact that was criticised
by the FA=92s independent regulatory commission.

Mikel, who was on Monday nominated for the 2012 African Footballer of
the Year award, appears determined to press ahead with the case.

Some Chelsea players fear another year-long investigation into an
allegation of racist abuse just weeks after the conclusion of the case
involving Terry.

The Chelsea skipper was found not guilty by magistrates in July, but
last month he was fined =A3220,000 by the FA and banned for four games. He
returns against Liverpool on Sunday.

Referees=92 chief Mike Riley revealed on Monday that Clattenburg - accused
by Chelsea of calling Mikel a =91monkey=92, which the official strenuously
denies - is to be interviewed by police investigating the incident at
Stamford Bridge.

Riley, who appoints match officials in his role as general manager of
Professional Game Match Officials Limited, said: =91PGMOL was fully
prepared to appoint Mark to matches this weekend.

=91However, having discussed this with him, we both consider it is in
Mark=92s best interests that he has this week away from officiating duties
while he prepares to help the FA and the police with their enquiries.=92

There is unease in the game that the FIFA official is being judged
before all the evidence has been gathered.

Terry continued to play for Chelsea after he was charged by police and
the FA with racially insulting Anton Ferdinand at Loftus Road on October
23 last year.

Clattenburg=92s future in the game is more uncertain and he will be
interviewed, under caution, by police.

Chelsea midfielder Ramires claims he heard the alleged =91monkey=92 abuse,
which led to the club=92s claims two hours after their defeat by
Manchester United nine days ago.

The club say they have provided the FA with an =91information pack=92 about
the alleged incident, but the game=92s governing body are refusing to
confirm receipt.

Meanwhile, police have arrested Gavin Kirkham, 28, over racist taunts
directed at Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck at Stamford Bridge
last Wednesday.
