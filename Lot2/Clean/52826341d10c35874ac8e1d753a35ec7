Oops, sent this just to Kerry. Re-sending in case anyone else is interested.

I *loved* Alberto Manguel's History of Reading. Scholarly enough =

that you could trust what he said, but so readable and enlightening. =

I'm looking to read some history of the book/printing, and I'm hoping some
of you can make some recommendations. I don't trust goodreads/amazon
reviews very much, especially not when it comes to history, which is why
I'm asking here. I don't want a big academic specialized text; I'm looking
for something that's detailed and high-quality but still more in the realm
of popular history than what I'd want if I were doing scholarly work on the
history of the book. This is just-for-fun reading, so nothing too dense and
difficult.
I'd be particularly excited if anyone knows a decent book on Chinese
printing & bookmaking, and/or a book about John Newbery and his endeavors
(again from a more popular perspective rather than academic).

thanks!

~Kerry
