Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Waterfall memory for each band
Hi Tim

Thanks for the hint - we look forward to seeing this feature in PowerSDR 
v2.5.x :-)

It would also be helpful if this future version of PowerSDR could expand the 
waterfall parameters to offer a faster refresh rate - ideally to something 
like the rate used in CW skimmer. I find the additional detail in the faster 
CW skimmer waterfall to be really useful, especially when viewing CW 
activity.

Do you think that it would be possible to increase the waterfall rate?

Thanks and 73

You may want to wait until PowerSDR v2.5.x is released (hint)
