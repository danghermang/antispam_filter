Thanks Jim.

I should have noted that I've been through 2-3 versions of the same process=
, and just now went through it all again, everything "textbook" when done, =
then focused on the equalization for various mics.

Out of the box the Default profile and the 'recommended' HM-Pro results are=
 definitely sub-optimal. I have to wonder why if this is a recommended mic =
that the radio is not set optimally for it. My initial experience is excess=
ive bass, mushy loud audio splattering. I set that aside to focus on the se=
ttings for the dual-element GM-5 and came back to it later.

Bottom-line - it's "all me". Turns out I have to cut everything at 500 Hz a=
nd below WAY back for every mike. =A0The objective of course is to get the =
important speech elements making power, and not waste power and spectrum on=
 the non-essentials. =A0We really don't need any audio presence below 125 H=
z on the 10-band EQ, and Low on the 3-band could be dropped completely. For=
 bass voice 250 and 500 Hz settings need some attention - I cut 250 complet=
ely and 500 -6db. =A0(it was pretty obvious from the 'barking' in the local=
 audio system that what was getting through wasn't higher range.)

I guess that's the good news - there IS decent equalization and the ability=
 to adjust the bottom end of the transmit filtering to keep all that energy=
 in check. Since I have a good idea of what my voice sounds like on pro-aud=
io and studio gear I can compensate accordingly. (Not bragging that I have =
the voice for radio...)=A0

Indeed basic level setting is one necessary critical aspect, then audio adj=
ustment steps should include equalization steps including waveform observat=
ion to determine which voice qualities are present and affect the signal. A=
 look at the Histogram and then the panadapter can tell reveal a lot! =A0 O=
nce equalization is handled, looping back to the audio chain may be prudent=
 so you're adjust the chain for "good audio" rather than the excess non-ess=
ential voice energy you just reduced.

Jim,
You need to balance all the components in your audio chain, so that one is =
not u nderpowered and another is making up for it by being over-powered.=A0=
 You're describing a classic audio overdrive problem in PSDR=A0that is easi=
ly fixable with this software. =

In essence, you start with a mic gain at about 35 and everything else in th=
e audio chain=A0off.=A0 Then speaking in a normally strong=A0voice, you set=
=A0each level (EQ, Leveler, DX, etc etc) so that the ALC level never exceed=
s -1dB.=A0=A0 Takes about 5 minutes per TX profile. =
