Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] crystal radios and the capture area paradox
WBob,

Have you ever hear of "pulsed power"?

You imply that this doesn't/can't exist.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_power

-------------------------
Not all the world operates at a single fixed frequency.

The notion of power is not tied to the use of a single frequency.

Power is the rate of energy per second.

That is, it is the energy averaged for a very short time, and then divided =

by that time interval.

Power does NOT have an implication of averaging over a long time.

-------------------
In contrast, average power involves averaging over a finite time, perhaps =

very long, and then dividing by that time interval.

------------------------
In the special case of a pure frequency, where E and H vary as
cos wt,
power varies as
cos^2 wt.

Average power is 1/2 of peak power in this special case.

--------------
For a square wave of power, average power is also 1/2 of peak power,.  But =

for the power in, say, a digital pulse train, the average power is the peak =

power time the duty factor of the pulse train, which need not be 1/2.

Here is how my mind works...

Any power that is indeed POWER contains a averaging over infinite time. That
said, nothing is truly POWER. So everything is compromised for some purpose.
In a very simple radar system a pulse of RF (say, 10 microseconds long) and
repeated every (say, every 10 milliseconds). Now the peak power is defined
as the power during the pulse and is most essential in the determination of
the radar performance and design of the receiver. The average power is the
peak power multiplied by the duty cycle (ratio of the pulse width to the
pulse to pulse time) and is used to determine the internal heating and power
requirements for the radar system.

Here is nice to separate these two essential powers by using adjectives, but
it is also clear that the term "average power" is redundant. All "proper"
power is averaged. The other powers are convenient "misnomers" of some
practical use.

I think Vrms came from the voltage across a resistor that satisfies
V=3DSQR(PR) and when used in P=3DV^2/R makes Prms

I think Vave (half the value of half the voltage waveform) has no practical
use being used for power in P=3DV^2/R.
