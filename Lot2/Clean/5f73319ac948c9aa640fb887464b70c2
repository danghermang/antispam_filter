Likewise.  Fresh install on to 256GB SSD.    Com0Com, VAC, MiniDeluxe, DDUTIL, CWSkimmer.     DPC
max this morning 370us.   i7 Machine. ASUS Board.

When testing the pre-release and beta I found that the drivers that may be culprits can include
anything wireless - network, mouse, keyboard etc.     Did not have any issues with Video or Storage
drivers.   My machine now has GB Ethernet instead if Wifi and a USB mouse and KB.     But I also
have a Logitech T650 touchpad that does cause spikes of 1000+ if used aggressively.

What I do notice on my Samsung TH700 Touch Laptop is that the DPC spikes go to 3000+ when using the
touch screen.    I use this laptop with the 1500.

The touch interface seems to be the biggest issue for me.

I have installed Windows 8 on a second internal had drive so that I can 
easily boot either WIn 7 or Win 8. I did a clean install on a 
reformatted hard drive and did not bring any files or applications 
forward from Win 7. I have now installed the full DXLab suite, PSDR 
2.4.4, CW Skimmer, DDUtil and PstRotatorAZ on Win 8 and nothing else so 
far. DPCs are about the same as they were on Win 7 with a maximum DPC of 
419 Us in the past hour. PSDR and my Flex-3000 are performing well. I am 
wondering if the folks who are having problems followed the upgrade path 
and brought everything forward from Win 7. That may be the difference.
