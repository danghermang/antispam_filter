Subject:[burners] Survey for Burners Involved in Boston Startups
Hi Burners!


I'm currently completing my final semester at Clark University, working on
a project to provide housing solutions for entrepreneurs working in the
Greater Boston area, specifically the Innovation District. As you may be
aware, Boston has a 4.5% apartment vacancy rate and the average rent in the
Seaport District/Innovation District is $2,769 and expected to rise 5% per
year. I do not believe that this type of housing scenario is conducive to
growing a startup community for entrepreneurs who have a limited amount of
resources at their disposal. I believe that I've found a sustainable
solution to this problem.


At the end of the semester I will be pitching my solution to a group of
investors who may (or may not) provide funding for this project. Part of my
pitch will include proof of concept that I hope to gain in part via primary
research, which is why I am reaching out to you today.


I know that there are many Burners involved in a Boston based startup. If
you are, would be so kind as to fill out this wicked quick, five question
survey? I've included this link (http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7N2DTLL)
 and for your review, I've included the questions found in this link below:


1. What city/town do you live in?
2. What do you pay per month for your current housing situation?
3. What city/town do you work in?
4. How far are you willing to commute to work?
5. Thank you for your time! Are you available for followup questions in the
near future? If so, please insert your preferred method of contact below.


Cheers!
Ashley
