Ed, that is correct, disconnect the wire(s) that go to Pins 1and/or 8 which=
 is grid 2, place a terminal strip nearby (or use a convenient non-grounded=
 tie point)=A0 and place the new 100 ohm resistors in place of the direct c=
onnection.

Since the diagrams show the tube having Pins 1&8 together internally the ch=
oice to jump them is up to you. No big advantage that i can see.

Rowe did not start adding those resistors until a year or so into the use o=
f 7868 tubes. Those tubes being highly efficient, are prone to shorts and I=
 guess a few fried trans convinced them that it was worth the 100th of a ce=
nt more to add them.
