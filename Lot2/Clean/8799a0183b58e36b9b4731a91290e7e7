Subject:[meteorite-list] AD: Gem, Mineral, and Jewelry Show - Marietta,
 GA (Atlanta) - November 16, 17 and 18, 2012
Hey, List Members!

This is just a quick note to remind you about the Annual Show this weekend (Friday through Sunday) in Marietta, GA (Atlanta area)! The members of the Cobb County Gem & Mineral Society have done a lot of hard work preparing for another great show.  Admission and parking are FREE!  More information can be found at:  http://www.cobbcountymineral.org/index.php/about/show

36 dealers from across the country will be there for you viewing (and purchasing!) pleasure!

The show will be held at Cobb County Civic Center, 548 S. Marietta Pkwy., Marietta, GA

Show hours are: Friday and Saturday, November 16 and 17, 10-6, and Sunday, November 18, 10-5.

Please stop by our booth and say, "Hi!" We are hard to miss! We're the folks with the ORANGE table covers! We do have some new things (minerals, fossils and meteorites!) that will be displayed for sale for the first time at this show. Hey, you just might find something that you cannot live without! My billfold sure hopes so! My credit card company does likewise! But, in any case, stop by and say, "Hi!" Please ID yourself from the list! It is always neat to put faces with names.

We hope to see you in Marietta this weekend! I'm sure you will have a great time!
