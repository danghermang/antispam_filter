Subject:[child_lit] GREAT CHILDREN'S LITERATURE TRIP
Everyone I know who has taken this trip RAVES about it!!!

Come join the Nye Memorial Children's Literature Tour in 2013! Visit the Czech Republic (particularly Prague), Croatia and Slovenia with a three-night add-on to Montenegro. Our tour guide is the president of In Quest of the Classics, Brian Mundy, an expert in this area. He promises to bring us to many children's authors and other wonderful venues. Included in our itinerary are trips to the famous Marionette Theatre and Laterna Magika in Prague;  a tour of the Kafka Library, also in Prague; a visit to the Gingerbread Shop in Slovenia; a workshop meeting with Slovenian authors; a walking tour of Diocletian's Palace in Split; and a ferry ride to Dubrovnik, among many, many other things. Once signed up for this great adventure, you will receive our incomparable trip reading list, and you can begin to anticipate the stimulating discussion sessions that we hold during the tour. 

Dates of the tour are June 20-July 1 (for the main tour) or June 20-July 4 (for the main tour with the add-on to Montenegro).  The tour leaders are Dr. Bev Hock and Dr. Sue Fox, both professors of children's literature.

Do join the Nye group--people who join us once want to come back again!! Every year we offer yet another unique tour to the wonderful world of literature.
