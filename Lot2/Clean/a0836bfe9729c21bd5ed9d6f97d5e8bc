In total there are 64 LIRs with more than one IPv6 allocation.

Of them,
- 52 LIRs have 2 IPv6 allocations each,
- 5 LIRs have 4 IPv6 allocations each,
- 4 LIRs have 3 IPv6 allocations each,
- 2 LIRs have 5 IPv6 allocations each,
- 1 LIR has 10 IPv6 allocations.

This data is also publicly available at: 
ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/stats/membership/alloclist.txt

Like has been mentioned on the mailing list, this is the result of 
mergers and acquisitions over time.

I hope this helps
