Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Capture Area
Kirk

OK, but the next point is that it's essential to know the captured
power from the antenna in the design of a receive system, because the
receiver must produce the necessary ratio of signal (power) to noise
(power) at its output.  If that is not done, either there will be
excessive noise coming from the receiver instead of the required
signal, or on the other hand the receiving antenna is unnecessarily
big and expensive.  A proper design avoids both those errors.  So
knowing the captured power is very important.

It's a little complicated because there are two important levels of
noise to deal with, loosely known as internal and external noise.
Internal noise is the thermal noise, while external noise is also
known as atmospheric noise.

Communications systems work with signals that are sometimes weak, and
the receiver has to detect signals as weak as the external noise
level.  Usually there is one transmitter working to one receiver.

Broadcasting is quite different, with one transmitter and thousands of
receivers, so economics says that the receivers are made cheaper and
there is more investment in the transmitter.  Therefore the signals
are very much higher than atmospheric noise, which can be neglected.
In this case a small and cheap antenna inside a similarly cheap
receiver is required.  But the signal power from the antenna still has
to be higher than the noise power by the right margin.

Fortunately AM uses signals that are so intense that antenna losses of
60-80 dB can be tolerated, and into that niche falls our old friend,
the ferrite rod antenna.

Ferrite rods are also used at low frequencies for communication
systems, because the external noise rises quickly as the frequency is
reduced.  Thus a comms system on 10 kHz only needs a noise figure
around 150 dB, and ferrite rods fit the bill very well, but that is a
specialised area we have not reached yet.

In all these cases the point to remember is that the antenna loss acts
as an attenuator between the antenna and the first amplifer.  But the
thermal noise level at the input to the first amplifier is still at
the kTB power level.  Therefore extra gain in the amplifier is NOT an
option if the antenna produces too little signal power :).
