 =

San Jose State University (SJSU) has graciously and generously hosted the =

EVDL at no charge since 1991.=A0 But the world is changing, and so is SJSU.=
=A0 =


Their support crew have notified me that, like many other universities, =

they're outsourcing communications services and shutting down on-campus =

resources. This includes email discussion lists.=A0 In fact, it seems that =
our =

list is the last one still standing.=A0 =


But no worries.=A0 The EVDL will forge ahead on another listserver - just a=
s =

it did when we switched from SJSU's old server to SJSU's new one in 2007.=
=A0 =


One thing will be different from the last move.=A0 Then, we took the =

subscriber list from the old server and just fed it into the new one.=A0 =

However, the members' status didn't transfer.=A0 So the new server promptly =

started sending out email to a few hundred long-forgotten subscribers who'd =

turned off email years before.=A0 The many whose email accounts were dead =

nearly brought the server to its knees with bounced mail.=A0 The few who st=
ill =

had their old email accounts were VERY surprised - in some cases, not =

pleasantly so - to hear from the EVDL again.

So this time, instead of automatically subscribing you to the new server, =

we'll have it send you an invitation to resubscribe.=A0 To stay on the EVDL=
, =

you'll need to follow a weblink in the email message you receive.

You'll also use a different address for posting, of course.

Most everything else will remain the same.=A0 The EVDL will still be an ema=
il =

discussion list.=A0 Messages will look very similar.=A0 It will continue to =

serve all the current members who still want to take part.=A0 The Nabble =

archive will remain our searchable online post repository and forum-style =

front end.=A0 We'll still be the Internet's oldest and most comprehensive E=
V =

support resource.=A0 =


Well, OK, one thing >will< probably change.=A0 You won't have to deal with =
the =

Milter Greylist any more.=A0 ;-)

No doubt there'll be some glitches - in fact I guarantee it! - but we'll do =

our best to iron them out.=A0 Please try to be patient.

Soon, you should receive an email invitation to subscribe to the new-but-
much-the-same EVDL.=A0 I hope you'll accept it and stay in this great compa=
ny =

of EV friends.
