Subject:[Maps-l] License change of OpenStreetMap to ODbL
Hello everyone,

as you probably all know OpenStreetMap has been in the process of
changing its license for a while. Well, as of two days ago the process
was finally completed and the source data from OpenStreetMap.org is
now licensed under the OBbL 1.0 [1].

For the moment the data in the osm_mapnik database on the toolserver
is still CC-BY-SA as the replication was suspend at the time of the
license change. However, in order to enable updates again, we have to
transition over to ODbL as well.

For legal reasons, the recommended (by the OSMF) transition strategy
is to drop any existing databases and re-import them fresh from the
newly release planet file now licensed under ODbL.  To be able to
enable updates again, I would like to do that fairly soon.

Apart from that, the attribution string needs to be slightly changed
for all projects that are using the OpenStreetMap data, once the
re-import has completed.

With respect to tile licensing, I suggest we follow the example of
osm's tileserver. While the underlying data is licensed ODbL, the
rendered tiles would be licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0

Could everyone who uses the OSM database on toolserver therefore
please check if there are any issues with transitioning to ODbL and
prepare for the change of attribution?

Given that the OpenStreetMap is used in Wikipedia through the
OSM-gadget, WMA and WIWOSM, does the wikimedia legal team have any
suggestions or objections to the change?


I'll keep you posted.

Kai
