Subject:Re: [kurtlist] SOI Japan Tour information

Found some additions on a ticket-sales page for Osaka, which needs
dramroll:

** Dorothy Hamill **, Ina/Zimmerman, Kerr/Kerr, Ryan Bradley, and
Shawn Sawyer.

Who'd expected Dorothy's rejoining SOI at the age of 56?

That means Kurt is not the oldest skater, at least in Osaka. =)
No information yet for Tokyo.
