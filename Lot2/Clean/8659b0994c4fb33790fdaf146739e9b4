Subject:[Chelsea] Luiz free kick
Have to agree with CaseyAlan. The best players do not often give away needless free kicks. The foul by Luiz enabled them to put pressure on us when they had been struggling to do so. It also gave them badly needed momentum. If we had not mounted a brilliant comeback I would have blamed Luiz for the loss. As it is lets put it down to another lesson for a player who will go on to be a great.
