Subject:[LUG] Last night's Exeter LUG meeting
Hi folks,

I just wanted to say a big thanks to everyone who managed to make it to 
the Exeter LUG meeting last night, was a really fun night getting to 
play with the servers and PCs and the chocolate brownies that Gordon 
brought along were gorgeous!

I also wanted to say thanks to Dave for the donation of the PCs, 
monitors and Dell laser printer.  It's going to be a real help in 
getting the project going.

By the way Gordon, what was the thing you brought along last night with 
the Raspberry Pi?  It looked quite interesting.  Was it some sort of DIY 
kit?

Rob
