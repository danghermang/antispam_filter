Claudia, 

I have to disagree with the statement  In my opinion Historical fiction is also written with the assumption that the intended reader will have some prior knowledge of the relevant historical events and context, so there isn't much explaining going on, just like science fiction doesn't explain how humans got here or there in the universe. "

I have learned so much from children's historical fiction (i.e.  Aleutian Sparrow, Queen of the Falls) and I've done presentations on teaching history to children's and teens with children's/YA literature.    I do look for back matter, further reading, etc.  so I can find out more and see what may have been 'tweaked' in the book (although, I'll say that the books that I love and appreciate the most tell me what they've changed) but I don't believe there's an assumption of knowledge on the author's part.

Enjoying this discussion,

Sharon
