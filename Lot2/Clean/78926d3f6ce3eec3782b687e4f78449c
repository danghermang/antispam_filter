Subject:[Koha] Browse by author or subject
Good day koha users and developers! I installed koha 3.8.4 on a debian 6.0
machine. I was putting in cronjobs for the site by following this:
http://manual.koha-community.org/3.2/en/cronjobsch.html. My last cron job is
/build_browser_and_cloud.pl -f -b 100a -t 600 -c. I was able to successfully
run it, I think. I was also tinkering on the OPAC of our site
(http://hreplib.congress.gov.ph), I tried the Browse by author or subject,
now my question is: when I search here, I'm getting results of authorized
headings with HASH(xxxxx). Is this normal? What shoud I do (to get it
right)? You can try going into the OPAC so you see what I was saying. Thanks
and more power!
