Subject:[Jukebox-list] Wurlitzer 1500 and 1550 decal set
Ed:

 

Thanks for your comments. I appreciate the help. Let's say I got lucky and it wasn't that difficult to put the 1500 to work. I am
working on cosmetics now, doing the walnut trim, chroming, etc. I hope to get as lucky with the 1550, which I haven't even started
to look at.

 

Thanks for the lead on decals. I will get them from Victory Glass.

Victor

I am just finishing restoring a W1500A and I got my decals from Victory Glass in Des Moines, Iowa. Be careful of that model -- it is
a nightmare -- I call it "Satan's Jukebox." It is a mechanical disaster and unless you have lots of experience with jukeboxes think
twice before tackling this 479 pound monster. Good luck.
