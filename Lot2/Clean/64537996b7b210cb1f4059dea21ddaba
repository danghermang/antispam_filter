Rick,
Is the "group coil" energizing ?

Ron, as you suggested i removed the Jones plugs from the chassis and connected together. No change. Still wont pull a pin. 
Regards,
Rick


Have two Seeburg model C's that I've been restoring. Put electronics back in and now when I make a selection, it takes off credits but won pull a pin. Both machines exhibiting the same trouble
 
 Here's what ive done so far and here is whats going on. 

Took the credit cancel unit out of the WSR, cleaned all the usual items, veified contact gaps on timing relay and cancel solenoid switch stack.
Cleaned and checked adjustment on electrical selector hold and snap switches.
Took apart the pinbank and cleaned all 100 contact washers, and contact plates, and group coil contact plates on top.

Connected everything back up and now when i establish credit, and make a selection, no levers move on pinbank. It does take credits off. 
Verified 1 amp fuse and checked fuse holder for good connection. If i manually pull a pin, mech starts scanning immediately, so i think the service switch is functioning.

Using the service manual and troubleshooting guide I've checked and rechecked 
What am I overlooking? 

Thanks!

Rick
