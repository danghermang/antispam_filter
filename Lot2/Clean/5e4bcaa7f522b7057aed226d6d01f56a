Subject:Re: [EVDL] Twizy Dizzy Nizzy - Buyers Are Smitten
That Twizzy auction ended at US$15K with reserve not met. That's pretty amazing for a little runabout like that. I've got a Gizmo soon to be on the market with 75 mile range for the light-footed (finger throttle, so light-fingered, but that doesn't sound correct) with a 52 mph top speed. One thing the Twizzy has that the Gizmo does not is a second seat, if you're the Thin Man. It doesn't look as though one could place a bag of groceries on the rear seat. I recognize that the passenger's legs will be surrounding the driver, a common space-providing method in tandem vehicles.

I'm sure the seller is disappointed to not have made a sale. It looks like a real head-turner.
