If that game had of been a horse race meeting, it would have been obvious 
that a "fix" was in.

Everything was fine while United were ahead, then as we caught up, things 
started to go to haywire.

And it could just be that because of the controversy already surrounding 
Chelsea, the Hamburger
decided to ensure that we could not win by racially abusing our players and 
expecting them to react.

The circumstances all fit such a scenario.

Just a thought.
