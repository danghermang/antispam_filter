Your points are valid. Also what is not mentioned is the Peter Schmeichel a=
nd Ian Wright incident where the keeper blatantly used a racist word at the=
 arsenal striker and no action was taken either by Man Utd or the FA despit=
e viewers who lip read the incident writing in complaining. I wonder when F=
erguson changed his mind about disciplinging Rio for not wearing the T shir=
t, if his captain reminded him about the said Schmeichel incident?

Is this ever going to get commented on?=A0 Or are the Ferdinand brothers no=
w entrenched as eternal victims, despite their individual questionable hist=
ories?=A0 And is anyone ever going to notice or mention the incongruence of=
 R Ferdinand's belief that A Cole should have either tailored his evidence =
on the basis of skin colour, and in so doing perjured himself, or not spoke=
n what he believed as true at all?=A0 Is that not racist?

And tell me why J Terry is eternally cast as the philanderer when an apolog=
y was issued to V Peroncel after her denial of any liaison with said Terry?=
=A0 And why the admitted serial philandering of Messers Ferdinand and Giggs=
, with his sister-in-law of all people, is quietly brushed under the carpet?
I can understand rival supporters taking prejudiced views based on team all=
egiances. But you are journalists plying a trade that should be aligned to =
the notion of investigation of facts.=A0 And collectively, you and your pee=
rs are getting ever lazier.

For some objective journalism, I know that will be an odd concept given the=
 prejudice surrounding J Terry, have a read of this http://huff.to/RrSOXL.

Kind regards, and good luck with the bile.
