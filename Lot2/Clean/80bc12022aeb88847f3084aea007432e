Hi Nigel,

Have you checked if the carousel gear motor armature is disengaging 
quickly enough?  I've seen this happen with many machines, the armature 
is slightly sticky on its' shaft and doesn't always release snappily 
enough to 'freeze' the gear box drive...

Watch the carousel motor when this happens - if it actually jumps then 
it is either the armature sticking slightly during its spindown or some 
switch not releasing enough to ensure power is cut to it.
