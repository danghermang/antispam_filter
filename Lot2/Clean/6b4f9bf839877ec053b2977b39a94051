I'm confused. We should all care about the way the community's resources 
are used. That's the whole point of this discussion (and this group). 
What we're now seeing, is new LIRs that never wanted to become LIRs in 
the first place and just wanted a /24 of PI space. They have no (real) 
alternative though if they want to multihome (as an LIR/ISP I'm with 
Nick on this one). How's that fair on them, considering registration and 
handling fees?

As far as IPv6 goes, most of us or on the same boat, no need to state 
the obvious. As Richard said, the question here is whether we should 
hand out PI from the last /8 or not.

regards,
Yannis
