Subject:Re: [EVDL] Precharge / Discharge
Hi Mike,

The reason for different resistor values are simply because
there are different requirements for both and because a
resistor is cheaper than a relay.

The pre-charge typically needs to happen within a few seconds
while the discharge can be prolonged to several minutes, because
it is not likely that you will have your controller apart within
minutes of turning the key off. This allows for a large value
discharge resistor which is often left permanently on, so there
is no chance of a contact failing and the caps not discharging.
Another reason is that you will need to continue to discharge
electrolytic caps even after removing an ininital charge, because
those critters tend to re-build their charge when left unconnected
(ask me how I know - I even blew an IGBT from the re-built charge
after initial discharging caps then disconnecting them - upon
re-connecting to the IGBT it gave a spark and the IGBT was a short)
so, many large high voltage caps come with a resistor permanently
attached to their (screw) terminals.

Some indicative calculations as example:
200V battery voltage
10,000 uF capacitor
The RC-time for the pre-charge, if we want a 1 sec time:
1s = R x 10,000u => R = 1/10,000u => R = 100
This means that the R must be no larger than 100 Ohms.

If the discharge time can be 5 mins (300s) allows the R to be:
300s = R x 10,000u => R = 300/10,000u => R = 30,000
This 30kOhm resistor allows a current of
200V/30kOhm = 7mA
This means that the power generated in the discharge resistor
is 7mA x 200V = 1.4W so a 2W or larger resistor should suffice
(better to use a 5Watt resistor so it runs cool and will not
fail from overheating - you do not want a safety item like this
to fail!)
As you can see, an additional 1.4W draw as long as your controller
is on is not significant compared to the power that the controller
itself is consuming and it guarantees that the controller is at a
safe voltage within 5 minutes after removing power.
That is why many user manuals - if they allow you to open a unit -
suggest to wait 5 mins after removing power.

Subject: [EVDL] Precharge / Discharge

Hello,

I recently built an OpenRevolt controller to replace my EV1 controller 
on my Jet ElectraVan.  I have no experience with precharge since the EV1

has no input capacitors.  I have been doing a lot of reading on the 
archives of this list and elsewhere.  I have a good understanding of the

precharge issue, but I haven't found any reference to the hazards of the

controller retaining a charge on its capacitors after the vehicle is 
turned off.  It seems to me that there is a safety issue.

I did find a commercially available precharge device that addresses the 
issue.  However, it uses a different resistance for the precharge and 
discharge paths.  Why?

My thought is to use a relay to connect the precharge resistor when the 
ignition switch is on.  The OpenRevolt controller supplies a signal to 
enable the main contactor at a preset delay.   I was considering using a

SPDP relay and the same resistor to both precharge and discharge the 
controller capacitors.  Am I mis-thinking?

Thanks,
Mike  --  Phoenix
