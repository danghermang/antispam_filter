Subject:Re: [address-policy-wg] Another small IPv6 allocation policy change
 proposal (sanity check email)...
I support this proposal and as non-native speaker I would never have
read it other than "you can extend all /32 you have". I think thats a
perfect example of how careful one schould be reading/writing
proposals, especial us non-native guys.

Greetings
