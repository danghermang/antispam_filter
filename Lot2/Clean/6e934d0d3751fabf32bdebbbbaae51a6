There are all sorts of errors in the Italian banners but I'm unable to 
point people to where they can correct them. I tried the following:
1) Special:Search on all namespaces
2) looked for a link on 
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2012/Translation
3) 
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Translate-status/Fundraising_2012/it
4) Fundraising 2012 aggregate group 
<https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ATranslate&taction=proofread&group=agg-Fundraising_2012&limit=1000&task=acceptqueue>
5) "Fundraising 2012/Translation/Landing Page and Banner messages" 
<https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ATranslate&taction=proofread&group=page-Fundraising+2012%2FTranslation%2FLanding+Page+and+Banner+messages&limit=1000&task=acceptqueue>

Some errors I found seem to have already been corrected in the past in 
some places but not not recently and not (as far as I can see) in the 
messages currently in use (of course, as I didn't find them).

I'm currently pointing people to 
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Fundraising_2012/Translation

In the meanwhile, to avoid a revolt on it.wiki against the fundraising 
team, I'll disable the banner in Italian. Thanks.
