Subject:[CT Birds] Young Cedar Waxwing Rescued what to do?
Hi All,

My son and his friends rescued a young cedar waxwing this afternoon in the
woods.  He/She cannot fly and we have called Mount Vernon Sanctuary and
left a message.

In the meantime, What shall we do to hopefully get this little guy going
again?

Thanks so much

Joe
