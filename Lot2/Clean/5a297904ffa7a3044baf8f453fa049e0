Subject:[CT Birds] Cedar Hill Fox Sparrow
10/23/2012 -  Newington, southwest corner of Cedar Hill Cemetery - 1 FOX SPARROW in the brush along the chain link fence. I'll take it as a consolation prize for not being able to relocate the Blue Grosbeak reported earlier today by Paul C. Also about were a Palm Warbler and many Song Sparrows and Juncoes.
