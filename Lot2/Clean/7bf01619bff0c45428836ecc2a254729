Subject:[Birding-Aus] Fork-tailed Swifts over Gluepot
Hi all & Mike,
Some 30 Fork-tailed Swifts were racing over Gluepot at 3pm this afternoon,
heading NE during a strong westerly front. Approx location was 33 48 50 S/
140 03 21 E. I haven't seen these here for many years.
Other goodies today, despite the weather (already 29C at 5:30am and
overcast, threatening all day, with light rain, followed by a windy cooler
change) included a male Scarlet-chested Parrot, two Red-lored Whistlers,
two parties of Striated Grasswrens and Black-eared Miners at their nest.
cheers
Peter
