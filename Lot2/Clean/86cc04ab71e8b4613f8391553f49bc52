Subject:Re: [h-cost] "Medieval brides wore red."
I wonder if the origin of this one lies with the word 'scarlet' rather than
'red'?  Or, alternately, with kermes and cochineal, rather than madder?

Generally speaking, cross-culture and cross-era, a bride is going to wear
her fanciest dress, so it seems quite reasonable that luxury fabrics or
expensive dyes would become associated with wedding gowns.  After all, we
tend to think about silk satin and delicate lace and so forth, don't we?
