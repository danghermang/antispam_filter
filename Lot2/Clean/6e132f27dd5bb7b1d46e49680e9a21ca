Subject:[CT Birds] Willington leucistic/albino Sparrow?

A friend called me today to describe a bird she had at her feeder in Willington. Not coming up with any possible identification over the phone, I stopped by to photograph it for her. Here's a link to the bird in question (you don't need a facebook account to view these photos).

Could someone give their expert opinion on an ID? 
Thanks!
