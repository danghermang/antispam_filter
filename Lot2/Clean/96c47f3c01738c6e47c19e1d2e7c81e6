Subject:[Birding-Aus] Franklins Gull
Gooday BA

 

We might make a dash down to Paynesville to try for the Franklins Gull this
weekend. Can someone please offer any information as to whether the gull is
still at the location and where exactly do we look for it. It appears we
have to drive over the King Street bridge onto Burrabogie Island and look
around the gravel carpark on the south end of the island somewhere.

 

Thanks
