CL5.5: Climate Time Series Analysis

This session is positioned at the interface between statistics and 
climatology and focuses on advances in estimating uncertainties in the 
analysis of climate time series. Possible sources of these uncertainties 
are in the measurements (space-time grid, analytical), the limited proxy 
quality and dating errors of paleo records, and, ultimately, the 
incomplete understanding of the various components of Earth's climate. 
Statistical-technical challenges to the analysis consist in non-normal 
distributions, autocorrelation, uneven spacing of sampling times and 
nonlinear relationships between climate variables. We welcome 
contributions dealing with those challenges in particular. Besides new 
methods, critical assessments of existing techniques employing 
real-world applications are appreciated.
