Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Problem with high DPC count after upgrading to
	W8	Pro
I ran the pre-release on a laptop I had and the DPC count was consistent at
1000.  The promise was that this would reduce on the release version.  I
guess I am fortunate that Win 8 won't install on the computer that I use for
the flex ( I wasted the weekend trying). 

I will count my blessings and install this thing on my kids laptop
instead!!! ;-)

Hi Les,

High DPC latency is one of  the things reported about Win8 in pre-release:
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/W8ITProPreRel/thread/aa16c25a-
9c72-4579-ba02-cea920296271

That info is pretty old (March?). I know some have reported using
Win8/PowerSDR with success.

Before going back to Win7 I would recommend trying to determine what is
causing the high DPC count  (Video driver? WiFi driver? Malware scanner?).
That way you could watch for updates to the offending object in case you
want to try Win8 again.
