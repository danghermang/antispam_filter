Web Cryptography API Draft Published

   13 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9564

   The Web Cryptography Working Group has published the First
   Public Working Draft of "Web Cryptography API." This
   specification describes a JavaScript API for performing basic
   cryptographic operations in web applications, such as hashing,
   signature generation and verification, and encryption and
   decryption. Additionally, it describes an API for applications
   to generate and/or manage the keying material necessary to
   perform these operations. Key storage is provided for both
   temporary and permanent keys. Access to keying material is
   contingent on the same origin policy. Uses for this API range
   from user or service authentication, document or code signing,
   and the confidentiality and integrity of communications. Learn
   more about the Security Activity.

Simple Delivery Profile for Closed Captions (US) Draft Published

   13 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9563

   The Timed Text Working Group has published the First Public
   Working Draft of "Simple Delivery Profile for Closed Captions
   (US)." This document defines the behavior expected of a
   presentation processor using the player constraints for such an
   online delivery profile. The Simple Online Delivery profile is
   focused on streamlined delivery of closed captions on the
   Internet. This interoperability profile supports core TTML
   features to deliver content originating legacy formats such as
   CEA-608 and -708 content, and is targeted primarily for
   delivery in US markets. The Simple Delivery Profile for Closed
   Captions focuses interoperability using TTML 1.0 to support
   delivery of closed captions for video content. Other profiles
   based on TTML 1.0 may target other types of subtitles such as
   on-screen text or graphics. This interoperability profile is a
   proper subset of TTML 1.0 plus features required to support US
   Government closed captioning requirements for online
   presentation. Learn more about the Video in the Web Activity.

Three drafts published by the CSS Working Group

   11 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9562

   The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group has published
   three Working Drafts today.

   http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members
     * CSS Conditional Rules Module Level 3. This module contains
       the features of CSS for conditional processing of parts of
       style sheets, conditioned on capabilities of the processor
       or the document the style sheet is being applied to. It
       includes and extends the functionality of CSS level 2,
       which builds on CSS level 1. The main extensions compared
       to level 2 are allowing nesting of certain at-rules inside
       '@media', the addition of the '@supports' and '@document'
       rules for conditional processing.
     * CSS Image Values and Replaced Content Module Level 4. This
       module contains the features of CSS level 4 relating to the
       <image> type and replaced elements. It includes and extends
       the functionality of CSS Image Values and Replaced Content
       Module Level 3. The main extensions compared to level 3 are
       several additions to the ‘<image>’ type, additions to the
       ‘<gradient>’ type, extensions to the ‘image()’ function,
       definitions for interpolating several ‘<image>’ types, and
       several properties controlling the interaction of replaced
       elements and CSS's layout models.
     * CSS Transforms. CSS transforms allows elements styled with
       CSS to be transformed in two-dimensional or
       three-dimensional space. This specification is the
       convergence of the CSS 2D transforms, CSS 3D transforms and
       SVG transforms specifications.

HTML+RDFa 1.1 Draft Published

   11 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9561

   The RDFa Working Group has published a Working Draft of
   "HTML+RDFa 1.1."This specification defines rules and
   guidelines for adapting the RDFa Core 1.1 and RDFa Lite 1.1
   specifications for use in HTML5 and XHTML5. The rules defined
   in this specification not only apply to HTML5 documents in
   non-XML and XML mode, but also to HTML4 and XHTML documents
   interpreted through the HTML5 parsing rules. Learn more about
   the Semantic Web Activity.

Last Call: Constraints of the Provenance Data Model

   11 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9560

   The Provenance Working Group has published a Last Call Working
   Draft of "Constraints of the Provenance Data Model." This
   document defines a subset of PROV instances called valid PROV
   instances. The intent of validation is ensure that a PROV
   instance represents a history of objects and their interactions
   which is consistent, and thus safe to use for the purpose of
   logical reasoning and other kinds of analysis. Valid PROV
   instances satisfy certain definitions, inferences, and
   constraints. These definitions, inferences, and constraints
   provide a measure of consistency checking for provenance and
   reasoning over provenance. They can also be used to normalize
   PROV instances to forms that can easily be compared in order to
   determine whether two PROV instances are equivalent. Validity
   and equivalence are also defined for PROV bundles and
   documents. Comments are welcome through 10 October. Learn more
   about the Semantic Web Activity.

Mobile Accessibility Resources Updated

   10 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9559

   The Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) published
   updated resources related to mobile accessibility. They cover
   how mobile accessibility is addressed in existing W3C
   standards/guidelines, and how the overlap between mobile web
   design/development and accessibility strengthens the business
   case. Learn more from the Mobile Accessibility Resources e-mail
   and read about the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).

     * 2012-11-14 (14 NOV) – 2012-11-15 (15 NOV)
       Shift into High Gear on the Web: W3C Workshop on Web and
       Automotive
       http://www.w3.org/2012/08/web-and-automotive/
       Rome, Italy
       Hosted by Intel and Sponsored by Webinos
       W3C’s Open Web Platform (OWP) is driving this and other
       industry transformations. The promise of the early
       information superhighway is being fulfilled. Whether
       tethering a driver’s smartphone or tablet to work with a
       car--or embedding technology into the car itself--there’s
       no need to reinvent the wheel. The Web can take you there.
       Participants in this workshop will have the opportunity to
       share their own perspectives, requirements, and ideas to
       ensure that emerging global technology standards meet the
       needs of the Web and Automotive industries.
