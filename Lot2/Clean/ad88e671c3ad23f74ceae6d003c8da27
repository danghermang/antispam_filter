Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Alan,

Remember that this thread started with discussion of Alan P's paper about 
LOSSLESS ferrite antennas.

You have consistently said that ferrites have losses, and no one has 
disagreed with you on this -- which issue is beside the point for the rest 
of us in this thread -- which point is to understand ferrite antennas in the 
approximation that they are lossless.    This is a good enough approximation 
at "low" frequencies that there seemed to be interest in discussing this 
ideal case.

You have been trying to redirect the discussion into the realm of very lossy 
ferrites.   This is of little interest to me -- and also to other members of 
the List, so far as I can tell.

So, I am happy to drop the matter of lossy ferrites.   Feel free to keep 
discussing them yourself.

--Kirk

Losses reduce the capture area.  We agree about that at last.  It's
the first sensible thing you have written, though a gross
understatement in the context of the present discussion.

I liked that bit that said: 'apart from losses, the capture area is
the same as a dipole'.  An equivalent statement would be: 'apart from
the Pacific Ocean, it's perfectly possible to walk from Chile to
Japan' :).

If all your sources have been talking about lossless ferrite antennas,
you can build a pile of them and put a match to it.  No wonder you
have been misled.  Such a thing does not exist and has never existed,
and I am sure all the readers on here know that.

Maybe that's why they have stayed so quiet.  If anyone is interested
in a real-world discussion, maybe we can start one now :)

The first thing to understand is that the signal power losses in
ferrite rod antennas are high, maybe as high as 70 dB.  That is the
gap in knowledge that you have to cross.  I thought everyone knew it,
which explains why I was on the point of wondering which one of us
needs medication :).   But you will need to consider the detail and
forget the broad-brush approach with those dubious amateur sources :).
