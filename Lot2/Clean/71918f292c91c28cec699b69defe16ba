Subject:Re: [child_lit] New York TImes review of A Casual Vacancy
I'm sorry, Monica!  I thought I checked all the posts on 
this subject before posting.  Somehow I missed yours.  I 
think I was looking at a different subject line.  I'm a 
little rusty using childlit!

Anyway, what does "physical metaphors . . to highlight 
emotional states because in children the two tend to be so 
closely allied" mean?  Forgive me if someone already pointed 
to this phrase.  All of the examples given can just as 
easily be found in literature for adults.  It's a sign of 
bad writing (which was my complaint on Facebook about 
Rowling's new book, if any of you saw it) in either case.
