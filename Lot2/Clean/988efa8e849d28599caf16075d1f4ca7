Harry, this confirms what I have suspected for a while

The amount of time you spend finding articles to post on here, which I know some don't like but I am very appreciative of, plus all your other posts, has made me wonder for a while how you managed to do it all.

But now we know - there are in fact two quite separate Harrys.

There's the one who wrote today: " I didn't notice that was said in the text - I realised play went on for a while"

And then there's the one who wrote yesterday: "Not so for St. Stevie for whom the referee blew up the second he went down"

All we have to do now is work out which one thought Mata was crap when we signed him, and said that signing Cahill was proof that if we were buying cast-offs from relegation certainties then we were condemning ourselves to a trophy-free future, and then ignore that one and listen to the other one.

But how do we tell the two of you apart?

I didn't notice that was said in the text - I realised play went on for a while - but if the principle stands at all it lasts until the ball goes out of play. Point being the players can't take the rule into their own hands and the ref is there to enforce the rule that play should continue unless it was for a head injury or for the keeper. At no stage would the injury get worse for not being treated - that's the point, isn't it?

Is that being said by Liverpool fans? The MotD footage is as clear as it needs to be, as all the ex-Liverpool players (Owen & Hansen) and Terry-hating (Roberts) panel agreed... as they laughed.
