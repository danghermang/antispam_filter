Subject:Re: [burners] Creatures of The Night this Friday!
I like this solution.

I will let others, who are a part of and support this community, know there
is now a way to share these awesome classes and events on this list without
fear of flame wars.

So, any classes or events you think this community might be interested in
can be posted on this list using the [event] tag.

Thank you all,

James
