Subject:Re: [child_lit] NY/NJ Child_lit folks
We are very lucky here, in the Northeast Bronx. We lost
internet/phone/tv for awhile, but never electricity. On the
other hand, my niece on the next block has had her
electricity out for days. At least five huge trees came down in
our neighborhood, and usually took wires with them.

It is Manhattan that is worrisome, as pretty much
everything below midtown seems to be out: our favorite
restaurants and doctors and such. I had no idea I spent so
much time below 42nd Street until I started to call places!
