..... that was pleasing. 

It doesn't undo the disappointment from Sunday, not even close, but pleasing nevertheless. 
With H, O and M on the pitch at the same time, we more or less get goal scoring opportunities every time we have the ball. Even more so when backed up by the brilliant Ramires. 

But, the brain dead defending from Luiz, that keeps reoccurring has to stop. We will concede many soft goals otherwise. I thought Romeu was horrible, not only when he gifted them their first goal. Sturridge has some bright moments, but he is still the same stupidly selfish player. 

When is the draw for the QF?
