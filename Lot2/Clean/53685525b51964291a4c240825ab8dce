Subject:Re: [EVDL] Low battery capacity on convertion lawntractor
Your range has declined.  You say you've already tried changing the battery. 
I assume you replaced with the same type and brand that worked well for you 
before.  (Yes?  No?)

You also say that charging time is now less.  That would suggest a lower 
capacity battery, a charger that's not doing its job, or (if you have such a 
critter) a controller that's shutting down before the battery is fully flat.

You say your battery "charges back to float at 39.6 [volts]" which seems on 
the low side to me.  In cyclic use, I would want to see a gel battery reach 
around 42.9v (14.3v per module) while on charge.  If your charger goes to 
float mode after a full charge and this is what you're measuring, perhaps 
this concern doesn't apply.

Your modules (Alphacell 220GLX) are rated 109ah and 221 minutes at 25 amps.  
By Uve's battery calculator (http://evdl.org/uve/battery.html) we get a 
Peukert's exponent of 1.11.  You say that they used to run the EV for an 
hour before, so you must have been using them at their one-hour rate, or (by 
the above calculator) 80 amps.

I'd suggest measuring the current your vehicle is now using in normal 
operation.  If it's significantly more than 80 amps, look for something 
causing extra friction or loss.  This could be a bad bearing, tires with low 
air pressure, heavy lubricant in a transmission or differential combined 
with cold weather, or a high resistance connection in the traction wiring.

Also measure the battery voltage at operating load for clues. This will be  
easier (and safer!) to do if you apply a dummy load to the battery rather 
than trying to measure while under way.   As long as you're sure the module 
interconnections are good, you can check each module individually.  

That doesn't mean "test with a battery tester."  I don't know what you mean 
by "The batteries read OK with a 1k load," but if you mean a commercial 
battery tester of the kind used for starting batteries, that's of little use 
here.  You'll need a real capacity test.  Checking the modules individually 
will again reveal any stinkers that are limiting your range.

Charge each module fully, preferably with a known-reliable 12v charger.  
Apply a known load, preferably close to your vehicle's current (75-80a), and 
time how long the battery takes to discharge to flat, that is, 1.75 volts 
per cell (measured under load) or 10.5v for the module.

There are fancy rigs for this, but my current test jig for 12v batteries is 
pretty simple and accurate enough for most purposes.  I use a 12v:120v 
inverter powering a 250w heat lamp.  This gives a ~20a load on the battery - 
actually a bit more because of the inverter's [in]efficiency (you really 
still need a battery ammeter).  I set an AC powered clock for 12:00 and plug 
it into the other receptacle on the inverter and let 'er rip.  When the 
battery drops to 10.5v, the inverter shuts down and the clock stops.  From 
the minutes and hours logged, I can calculate amp hours at that load.  

An improvement to this setup would be to use a logging DVM to log the actual 
battery current against time.  It probably goes up as the battery voltage 
falls to maintain constant power.  However, this system gives "good enough" 
answers most of the time.

Four lamps like mine would give you your ~80a load, and warm up your 
workbench area nicely. ;-)  A 1500w space heater (if it really draws that 
much current - careful!) would draw ~125a from the battery.  

Hope this helps!
