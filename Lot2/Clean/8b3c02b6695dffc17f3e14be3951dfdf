Subject:[child_lit] Museums/Orhan Pamuk
Dear all,

I'm almost finished editing my list of museums/museum artefacts in 
children's books and will email it to the list as soon as it is 
finished. In the meantime I wanted to share this article from today's 
edition of one of the UK broadsheets, about the museum Orhan Pamuk 
created to go with his book (thanks to Tim Regan who originally pointed 
out this book to me)
