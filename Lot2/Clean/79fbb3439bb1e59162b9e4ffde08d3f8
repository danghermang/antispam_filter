Subject:Re: [child_lit] Looking for book suggestions
How about Sonia Manzano's recently published book, "The Revolution of
Evelyn Serrano," which is set in Washington Heights? Although the story is
set in 1969, the main characters are all Puerto Rican American and the
relationship between 15 year old Evelyn, her mother and her grandmother is
one of the main themes. Each of the women are strong in their own, very
different ways.
