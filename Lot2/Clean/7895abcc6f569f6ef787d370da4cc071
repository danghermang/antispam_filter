HS7.4/AS1.22/CL2.15:
Hydrological extremes in a changing climate: Risk, impacts, and
insurance

A warmer atmosphere can carry more water, and climate warming may 
increase the magnitude of hydrological extremes. Yet the system 
air-water-soil is a complex network with many poorly understood 
variables and processes. With our currently available tools (data, 
models, and statistical methods) we considerably lack knowledge about 
changes in risk of floods or droughts on yearly to decadal timescales.

This session explores how the climate risk insurance industry and the 
academic climate-impact model community deal with this challenge. We 
welcome contributions about advances in data, models, and methods that 
help us to make more accurate predictions of changes in hydrological risk.
