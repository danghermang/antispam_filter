Lots of good points and suggestions in these last few emails regarding
encryption.

Simply put, encryption is quite a big deal and it's not something you
should just casually and half-arsed sling together one afternoon because
it seemed like a good idea. Like any non-trivial computer operation, you
should definitely take a little time out to do your research, understand
all of the implications and make sure you have a plan B in case you want
to roll back. Here are some rules of thumb and general observations:

1: Truecrypt is an excellent option, especially for windows machines
(doesn't require the same level of complexity, hardware TPM options, etc
as Bitlocker)
2: Macs have their own built-in encryption options (including full disk
and encrypted Time Machine backups) since 10.7/10.8
3: Linux has LVM+crypto options for either home or full disk encryption
that are well documented and highly reliable
4: All major crypto options listed above have the facility to store
backups of the volume header files+keys - you *must* do this in case of
corruption/forgotten passwords/etc
5: If you have a laptop that travels much, you have no excuse not to use
full disk encryption (it's a legal requirement for many public/private
sector organisations now)
6: There is virtually no down side to using at least home folder
encryption on a static workstation - servers in secure locations are a
different matter
7: Data recovery is hard full stop - make backups, and test them (most
people never try restores until it's too late, and then they find
they've made a mistake)
8: Version control is your friend, and an excellent 'accidental' backup
strategy. Check your home, var and etc partitions into a DVCS on to an
encrypted location and you have both a versioned history AND backup.
