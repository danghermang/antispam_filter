Ray -

Fortunately the company is still in busines and going strong. My friend Bob
Schappert knows the machine well (he owns one) and can probably assist you
although he lives in Patterson, NY, but he may be able to help you locate
someone in your area who can.  Here are a few links Bob sent me a few
months ago. He is on a trip now in the Phillipines and will be back in
early November if you want to contact him. Mention I referred you.  His
email address is:

Robertlschappert@msn.com

Good luck.

The Sound Leisure " Rocket 88 " CD

The Mechanism was created by Alan Black of Sound Leisure and is the
simplest CD
Mech ever made for Jukeboxes. I was there to see the premire intro of this
mechanism at the ATEI International Music and Amusement ( commercial ) show
at Earls Court, London.
