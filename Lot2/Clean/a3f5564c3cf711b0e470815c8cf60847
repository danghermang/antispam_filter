Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Chelsea's Juan Mata 'didn't hear' Mark
	Clattenburg's	alleged comment [Sky]
It's newsworthy because, so far, Romeu is the only player to have spoken publicly about the affair. 
He doesn't add much, except saying that Mata didn't hear the remark. 
It's possible there is a translation error, but what he said is presumably on tape because it was said to a Spanish radio station. 
No reason to get exercised. 
I don't know about you, but I don't have a clue what happened on the pitch. Are the refs lying? Are the players lying? Is there a huge misunderstanding because of the various nationalities involved and a ref speaking Geordie? 
It's natural to want to rally behind "our" folk, but I don't want to see an innocent man hanged. The consequences here are potentially far more serious for Clattenburg than anyone else involved. He was a crap ref on Sunday, but I need to hear the inquiry evidence before I'm prepared to decide he's also guilty of racism.

Surely the alleged perpetrator is as guilty as if the victim had heard it themselves, as already established?  Or am i missing something?
