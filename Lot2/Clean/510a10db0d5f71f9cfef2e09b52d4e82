Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] 1/2-wave vertical - Hy-Gain 5/8 Venom

I'm guessing that those small radials work as a kind of capacitive
load.  A 5/8 wave has a relatively high base-impedance on perfect
ground, plus some reactance, so it's possible that someone has found
that they help the tuning (it could be modelled on NEC).
