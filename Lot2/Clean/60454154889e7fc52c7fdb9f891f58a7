Subject:[child_lit] Fwd:  Request for titles-loss, grieving, resilience
I had a list member contact me about books, mistakenly thinking I had sent
the original request. Below is her addition as well as the original
request. Thanks, ej

*I read your request on childlit. Many of my favorite titles have already
been mentioned, but I wanted to suggest two more.  *
*
*
*When I worked as a children's librarian years ago, among the picture books
I would recommend, particularly when parents requested books that would be
useful with a child whose grandparent had died,  was Old Pig, by Margaret
Wild, illustrated by Ron Brooks. Parents often returned or wrote notes to
thank me for this book in particular.  When I read it aloud to MLS
students, I tried to remember to bring tissues to class.  *
* *
*I also found The Dead Bird, by Margaret Wise Brown, illustrated by Remy
Charlip (a classic picture book version of Margaret Wise Brown's poem) to
be beautiful and useful.  Briefly,  four children who are playing in a
field find a bird that has just died. They take the bird into the woods at
the edge of the field and enact a funeral for the bird: burying it, placing
rocks and flowers on the grave, and singing a song that they make up.  The
children leave woods by moving through them, rather than retracing their
steps, and we see them playing again in the open. . The final text tells us
that the children go back to visit the bird "until they forgot."  *
*
*
*I wish you the best in your important work,
*
