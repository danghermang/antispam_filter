Gregg,

IF a quarter-wave (or half wave) vertical without ground plane were self 
resonant, it would not need a ground plane.

But it is NOT self-resonant if there is no ground plane.

The needed ground plane does not have to be supplied by radials, if, say, 
the ground is damp and conductive.    So, it depends on where you live how 
much difference adding radials makes.

If you want to avoid radials, you can add an matching inductor (without the 
ground plane, the reactance of an end-fed antenna is negative/capacitive).

Changing from a quarter-wave to a half-wave vertical, without ground plane, 
does bring the radiation resistance up to about 1/2 that for a half-wave 
center-fed, self resonant antenna, but the reactance is still large and 
negative.

If you do add the ground plane, the vertical should be quarter wave, not 
half wave, for the antenna to be self resonant.

Subject: [Antenna-discussion] 1/2-wave vertical really needs a ground plane?

Hello,
I had a question concerning whether a half wave vertical really
needs a ground plane or not.

I recently gave a friend of mine an old half wave vertical and
I told him it does not require the radials because its a
half wave, and they are self resonant antennas that will work
without them.

I have recently read that all unbalanced antennas
(regardless of wavelength) require some sort of return path
for the currents following through them.

This has me really confused, because I have never noticed
a problem with RFI, common mode currents usf. while using this
antenna.

What is your opinion on this?

Best Regards,
Greg Morris
