Subject:[Koha] Barcode - Gaps
Dear Colleagues,

 

I do not know if the question has been answered in the koha list. However I
want to know if there is a SQL script to find the missing barcodes or
accession numbers in the database.

 

As I have done bulk import and I would like to find accession/barcode number
gaps, so that I would fill the gaps.

 

Thanks
