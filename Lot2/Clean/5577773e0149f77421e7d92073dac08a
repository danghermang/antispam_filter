6CZ5 is the other substitute Jim. Same 1-8 jumper.
This is the valve that National rebranded as a 6973, and put a little =
pin
jumper underneath.

I have 6CZ5 in my Continental one and they are FAR  better in output and
sound depth than the EH 6973's. I've got various sets for comparison.

Incidentally, a major jukebox restorer in the UK, of very high repute no
longer uses the EH valves, as the outputs are never up to spec, and are =
too
variable.
I know there was a bad batch some years ago, but this is now.

At least they still make them. I remember in the 80s, the EL34 ? was a
common replacement, but in my opinion the output was noticeably lower in
that setup.

Nigel

Gentlemen:

Earlier on, this discussion string asked whether EL84/6BQ5 tubes could =
be
substituted in jukebox amps for the harder-to-find 6973 tube types.=A0 =
In
general, the=A0conclusions put forward by all contributors came down to:

Electro-Harmonix, the Russian tube manufacturer is currently offering a
genuine
6973 tube that are=A0of good quality. None of the other 2012 tube
manufacturers have=A06973's in their product line-up.

By making minor circuit adaptations (install jumper wire on 6973 socket =
from
pin
1 to pin 8), you can use 6973 substitute 6EM5 with slight reduction in
output power=A0(audio wattage). Old-stock, US-built 6EM5's seem to be
plentiful and are less expensive than the EH 6973's.=A0 None of the
world-market tube manufacturers are making new 6EM5's. =A0=A0=A0There =
may be a
second old tube type that could be substiuted here. I don't have that =
tube
number.=A0

Some circuit modifications were mentioned=A0that provide a safety =
element when
running 6973 tube circuits. 6973's=A0are more prone to short circuits =
than
other power-pentode tube types. Shorted tubes can burn out output
transformers,some of which can be difficult to find replacements for.

I mentioned the availability of plug-in adapter tube sockets,intended to
substitute EL84/6BQ5 tubes in place of other output tube types.=A0 These
adapters are called Yellow Jackets (web: www.yellowjacketstc.com)=A0 and =
are
intended=A0primarily for guitarists and musicians' amps.=A0=A0 Most =
Yellow Jacket
adapters are designed to substitute EL84's for higher-power octal tube
types, reducing the output wattage of higher-powered=A0amps to =
produce=A0the
slightly-overloaded Class A amp sound that some guitarists=A0seek =
without
having the killer volume levels.=A0=A0=A0 Yellow Jackets doesn't make an =
adapter
that will accomodate/convert 6973 tubes to EL84 operation.=A0=A0These =
devices
wouldn't be of help to the=A0typical jukebox amp rebuilder.=A0 Sorry for =
the
incorrect information.=20

If you need, you can have most any transformer rewound here:
