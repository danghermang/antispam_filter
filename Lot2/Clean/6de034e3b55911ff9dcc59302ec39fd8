I grew up in the 50s (yes, I=92m really very late middle-aged now!) and my
parents were almost fundamentalist (Christian Scientists actually) so they
disapproved of fantasy. I didn=92t encounter even the classic fairy tales
until I could read them myself =96 oh, and the joy of borrowing Kipling=92s
=93Just So Stories=94 from a neighbour! But it all makes me wonder if it=92s
religion more than anything else that influences the books a child meets? I
know I read "Ways with Words" when I was writing my PhD thesis, and the
difference Shirley Brice Heath found between the black and white communities
she studied seemed mainly based on the "It=92s teaching them to tell lies.
It=92s made-up" philosophy. (It=92s a long time since I read it so I hope I=
=92m
not mis-remembering.)

From my distance on the other side of the world, with almost no contact with
African Americans, this is my =91two bobs=92 worth=92 as we say.

Subject: [child_lit] An African-American friend asks who read what?

I have an African-American net-friend in New Jersey, who has been a music
teacher, a computer techie and, I gather recently, a librarian. =

He recently posted the following musings on Facebook.  He gave me permission
to repost his comments anonymously to Childlit, and asked me to let him know
what the response was.

"I  was playing "Draw Something" with a friend of mine, and unable to draw
the item, she gave me the hint of "Lion, Witch, & ___." I immediately
guessed WARDROBE, but then I got to thinking. No, not about the written
hints, but about the assumptions of what books we've either read or know
about.

  Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and the like were books I had never heard of
until I got to college, where they seemed to pop up in the conversations of
other people. In fact, I clearly remember that my first encounter with
Tolkien was through the Harvard Lampoon parody "Bored of the Rings," which I
picked up somewhere  during the summer of 76. I found it so hilarious, even
without getting most of the references, that I decided I had to read the
originals.

  Insert sound of crickets chirping here.

  I was fairly well-educated. I read voraciously. I was in the CP track of
my public high school and graduated in the top 5% of my class, but had never
heard of any of these books or authors. What was going on?

  Two possibilities strike me. The first is that while those books are
well-known, they're well-known to a certain subset of people. They're not
the books that 90% of us grew up reading or having read to us.

  The other possibility, and quite frankly, the one that came to mind first,
is that these just weren't books that the average African-American kid had
ever heard of or cared about. They weren't books that their parents had ever
heard of, and hence, weren't books that were read to them by their parents.
And for those of you who forget  (or didn't know in the first place), my
high school was 99% black.

  Or...maybe it was just me. Maybe while *I* was sitting at home, reading
everything I could get my hands on by Jean Shepherd (and therefore knew
"You'll shoot your eye out" a good 10 years before most of the rest of you),
the rest of my classmates actually *were* reading Tolkien and Lewis.

  I'm interested in this both personally and as a librarian.

  And now that I think about it, I wonder how popular the Harry Potter
series has been among black kids."

So those are his ideas. Let me know what you think.
