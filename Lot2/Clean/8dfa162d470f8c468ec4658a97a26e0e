Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Typical FA
"I don't give a choc ice" would have been OK. The other one wouldn't. It's the combination of "black" and "cunt" that makes it offensive, regardless of context. That's my interpretation. Maybe "monkey" could be stigmatised in the same way if it was combined with "retarded" or something.
