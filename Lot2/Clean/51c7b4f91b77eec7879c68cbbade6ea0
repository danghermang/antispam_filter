Chelsea ace Oscar last night explained why he feels so at home in SW6,
declaring: =93We=92re the Blue Brazil.=94

The desire and spirit of Roberto Di Matteo's men saw them steal a
Champions League victory over impressive Shaktar Donetsk through
Victor Moses' injury-time strike.

Oscar=92s fourth =ADChampions League goal in as many matches was the
highlight of the night for home fans, the 21-year-old chesting down
keeper Andriy Pyatov=92s panicky headed =ADclearance before =ADbeautifully
rifling the bouncing ball home from 40 yards.

And with Oscar=92s terrific link-up play with Juan Mata and Eden Hazard
improving all the time, the =A325million signing from Internacional
admitted at teams he feels he has never left his home in Sao Paulo.

Oscar said: =93It=92s a pleasure to play for a team which attacks like
this. I=92m Brazilian, so of course I like playing this style of
football a lot.

=93It makes me happy to be playing in a team that plays this way, and to
be at a club that wants toplay the type of football that I enjoy
playing. That=92s very important to me.

=93This is my first experience in English football so naturally there is
a process of adaptation as I get used to the different environment.

=93But I=92m pleased with =ADeverything so far. And every game I play I get
more used to it, so I know I will keep getting better.

=93I feel my relationship with Juan and Eden is growing with every game
we play together, as we get used to each other.

=93You can feel it improving with every game that passes and every time
we play together it feels like we understand each other more.
Hopefully there is more to come.=94

Chelsea will be hoping for a repeat of Oscar=92s sensational goal
against Juventus when they travel to Turin in a fortnight knowing they
must get a draw or be staring at an early exit.

And Fernando Torres, who took full toll of Pyatov=92s initial blunder to
edge Chelsea in front before the first of Shakhtar=92s Brazilian star
Willian=92s two equalisers, conceded Di Matteo=92s team must wise-up.

Torres said: =93I was happy with the result but we know we must do much
better and that we have to improve.

=93We have been creating problems for teams, pressing and creating
chances from their mistakes, but not when we have the ball like we=92re
used to.

=93When we needed to win, we did. We did it last season against
Valencia, Napoli and Barcelona =96 also the final against Bayern Munich.

=93Shakhtar was really the first big test of the season and we did it as we=
ll.

=93Maybe we were a bit lucky but Chelsea has this special thing that no
one can buy.

=93We all know this kind of situation cannot happen again because,
=ADespecially in the Champions League, at times like these you can be
out.=94
