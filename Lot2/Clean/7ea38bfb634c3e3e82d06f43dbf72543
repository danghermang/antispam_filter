Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Chelsea's Juan Mata 'didn't hear' Mark
	Clattenburg's	alleged comment [Sky]
It's relevant because now it's being reported that Mikel and Mata didn't
hear what was said, it's reported that none of the 20 Sky cameras picked
up what was said, there's no audio record, 4 officials are wired
together who will no doubt say nothing like that was said.

Against that, Luiz and Ramires, both of whom only learned to converse in
English within the last 12 months, say they heard a Geordie say these
things.

While I've no doubt they're both well-versed in the words "twat" and
"monkey", having been at CFC for a while (see Wise\Zola passim) I can't
see how anything will be provable.

From Mikel & Mata's pov, it's a case of someone else telling them what
someone else has said.

Imo, not a chance in hell of making this stand up, though fully accepted
I haven't got a clue what the various players are indicating might've
happened.

Harry
