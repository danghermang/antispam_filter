Subject:[CT Birds] Migrating in the rain
I think all of us who hawk-watch at Lighthouse Point have had hawks 
migrating in the rain a few times. I remember once when I was there with 
Bill Banks. We were driven into our cars by the rain, but looking in 
different directions we could see hawks flying. Since we were seeing 
different birds we quickly developed an impromptu set of hand signals to let 
each other know what was going by. Not surprisingly, the species seen under 
such conditions are mainly ones that don't rely heavily on soaring, such as 
falcons, harriers and ospreys.

I'm sure this only happens with a fairly specific set of circumstances, such 
as birds moving through favorable skies that encounter a localized storm and 
just keep going.
