I'm a sucker for punishment. I've been trawling to see what the blogs et al are saying. No surprise that the scum commentators are showing shots of Torres' high boot into Evans chest as a justification, fair enough probably, that he shouldn't have been on the pitch. 
No surprise then that are no shots of Evans planting his studs into Drogba's sternum in a certain cup final.
