Sure. You clearly know what you're talking about and you probably have
a lot more hands-on experience with this than I do. But I do make my
money, albeit indirectly, by people needing better protection for
their computers. And I do know what I'm talking about: I know my
Blackhole from my BEAST and my Duqu from my DNSSEC.

(But then, I don't think we disagree about most the technical details.)

I beg to differ about TLS being "hopelessly" flawed.

CRIME and BEAST aren't easy to exploit. They require a lot of effort,
effort that means it is unlikely to be worth the effort (read: time
and money) to attack anything an average Internet users does online.

The Iranian government isn't hopelessly incompetent. At least the
hackers working for them aren't. Full stop. (The people running
Diginotar were, perhaps, which is why a hacker of moderate competence
managed to generate forged certificates. That was really bad.)

Sure. They forged a hash-collision to fake a Microsoft certificate to
push a forged Windows update in Flame. They probably use similarly
advanced methods against some of their own citizens. This _is_ an
issue. Perhaps we should all go out on the streets and protest against
it. But it doesn't affect the way I use the Internet for my daily
web-browsing.

Sure, I can't 100% trust DNS. I know that. For just about anything I
do online this simply doesn't matter.

Well, I don't run any of these either.

I agree that security at many SCADA systems is pretty bad. If I would
work for one of them, it'd be a major concern. Perhaps it should be
for me as a citizen of this country, or of this world. It doesn't
affect my day-to-day computer usage though.

(Also, it's probably good to point out that, despite all this talk of
insecure SCADA systems, there is only one know piece of malware
actually being used in the wild that attacked such a system. And that
was advanced beyond imagination.)

Just to make it clear: I am *not* saying that and explicitly not
making this point. I think all Internet users should consider
themselves as a potential target and take precautionary measures. I'm
just arguing against overdoing it.

Because they'd leave traces?

I know what my machine can be used for (although I have no idea of the
going price for a compromised home user Linux box). I know my
Facebook, Paypal, email etc. can be stolen if enough of an effort is
made. But the probability is relatively small; smaller than equivalent
risks in the offline world.

(I use two-factor authentication wherever I can. I know this isn't
100% perfect -- nothing is -- but it puts the bar a little bit
higher.)

Sure. So VPN access should _always_ require a second authentication
factor. And networks of any size, but especially the larger, should be
wary of threats coming from the inside. And no, none of this prevent
attacks from happening. It just reduces the chances.

There isn't. I hope I never gave the impression that I think there is.

My point is that almost every target has a limited value. That value
may be a few pence for a home PC in China or millions of pounds for a
large corporation. As soon as you drive up the costs of an attack
beyond that value, you're protected well enough.

Of course, it isn't easy, or even possible, to determine that cost.
And of course, a small minority of attackers (hacktivists and
governments) have non-financial motives.

If a "ultra-hacker" has the option of hacking me or David Cameron,
assuming we're both equally well protected, they'll go for the latter.
At least they will in at least 99.9% of the cases. If they do somehow
decide to target me, that's a risk worth taking. Using computers comes
with risks; if you're not willing to take them, go to the library for
your information, start corresponding to friends by writing letters
and move your social life back to the pub.

I have seen no evidence of zero-days being used in automated
mass-attacks. That is, not as long as they're still zero-days.
(Zero-days in much used applications are worth in excess of $100,000
on the market for exploits. By using such an exploit in a mass-attack
you give it away and thus it loses it value. You need an awful lot of
infections with your mass-attack for it to be worth it.)

There are many examples of exploits that were once zero-days being
used for mass-targets. Sometimes very soon after their discovery: a
recent Java exploit was added to Blackhole before Oracle had patched
it. But then, that's Java. And that's Oracle.

Not if your goal is to be 100% protected, because 100% protection is impossible.

Sure, so you need to apply patches against the vulnerabilities
exploited by what once were zero days. And run security software that
recognize those exploits.

As you say: this happens 'tomorrow'. For most users, there is time
between today and tomorrow.

But that has nothing to do with forged certificates, right? That just
means that yet another company has messed up its systems.

One thing I could have added to just about anything I wrote above is
that the same holds for our "offline" security. If you try hard
enough, you can steal my bank cards, spy on me, even kidnap or kill
me. But I have a reasonable idea of how much of a target I am and thus
how much of an incentive attackers have to target me. And I know what
the risks of unrecoverable damage are in case something happens. Given
the precautionary measures are take, those risks are really small.
