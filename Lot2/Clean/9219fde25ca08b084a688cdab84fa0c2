quest to ID the bird. He is copied in the e-mail too. =

There was a healthy discussion among a few of us and many are calling it a
non-breeding Double-banded Plover. To me it does not appear right. The legs
are black, the bill is longer and more tapered. A DbP should have yellowish
legs and a far shorter bill when compared to body size. I don=92t know, to =
me,
the bird appears to be a Red-necked Stint. =




Can any of you knowledgeable birders suggest what these two small birds in
front of the godwits are? =

Thanks for your help.
