Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] Meteorite-list Digest, Vol 112, Issue 41
If someone on this thread would like to help me identify a few
specimens I found, I could use the help..I have nice pics, ready to
send...my main rock has a quartz base, but, has what looks like
crusted fusion, and, am curious if it may classify as a tektite, from
Novato yesterday...looks like a good place to hunt will be between St.
Helena and Yountville, where possible 10KG has spread, and, toward
Lake Berryessa, East, towards possible impact zone.

>
> A few quick notes about the new offerings :
>
> The North American Meteorites map is from my personal collection.  It
> is not the same as the US Meteorite Map sold previously in my store.
> This is a great map that is suitable for educational/outreach use or
> for framing/display in the home or office.  The photos I have taken
> are not very good because there is some glare off the lamination.  It
> is a superb-looking map with a lot of good data on it.  It is very
> informative with a lot of associated text, data, facts, stats, etc.  I
> only have one of these available.
>
> The black trinitite is the last piece I have.  I overlooked it when
> going through my collection a couple of weeks ago, but found it when
> packing orders a several days ago.  It is an excellent piece and I
> don't understand how I previously overlooked it.  It's one of the
> darkest black pieces I have seen and it was formed in cross-section,
> so you can see the inside which is usually hidden from view.  It
> appears to have formed this way or was broken very shorty after
> formation.  It does not appear to be broken from recent damage or
> handling.
>
> The Pat Mulvany stabilized iron meteorite is one of the rare "nickel
> patina" specimens that has a gleaming and eye-catching bare metal
> finish.  It's stunning and it takes more work and time to achieve this
> patina during stabilization.  This is one of only a small handful to
> be offered this year and all of them have sold rather quickly after
> being offered.  I don't expect this one to last long.

> Website News :

> been making cosmetic tweaks and the new logo graphic is in place.
> Although the site looks very different from before, it still works the

> Also, if you encounter any glitches or errors with the checkout or
