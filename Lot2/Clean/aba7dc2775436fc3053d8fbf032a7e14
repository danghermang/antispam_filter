To All Concerned US Tax Payers...

I have been troubled by what is a clear misappropriation of US tax payer fu=
nds by NASA/SETI. At a time of this country's financial crisis, this is no =
time to squander our tax dollars!!

We have all seen and read about 'The Blimp" that was, as stated in the arti=
cle link below, "... a NASA-hired airship." Not only are they using a priva=
tely owned "Blimp" for frivolous and far-fetched 'research', but they are a=
lso giving free joy rides to private citizens as stated from the article, "=
Glenn Rivera [a private citizen] was invited by astronomers [NASA/SETI] to =
hunt for more meteorite crash-landing sites from a NASA-hired airship."

In recent conversations, I and many of my colleagues and some NASA scientis=
ts (who wish to remain anonymous), have all concluded that finding meteorit=
es [of any size] is completely impossible and a waste of tax payer dollars!=
 How can one think you can spot a black rock the size of a dime, a golf bal=
l or even a basketball from an altitude of 1000 feet?

The only entity that benefits from these dream hunts is the private company=
 who owns "The Blimp". They get paid by NASA for use of "The Blimp" and the=
y also benefit from all of the free advertising with their logos and web ad=
dresses emblazoned on the sides of "The Blimp"!

As far as I am concerned, hunting for meteorites floating in the sky is ful=
l of hot air!

Here is the link the the article I reference:
