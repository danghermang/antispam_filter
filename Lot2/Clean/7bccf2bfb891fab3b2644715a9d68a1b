Subject:Re: [child_lit] New York TImes review of A Casual Vacancy
I did think it was interesting the way she made distinctions 
between how children read and how adults read, implying that 
children have different expectations of and experiences with 
fiction as compared to adults.  I don't have the article 
open on my browser any more, but if someone does, could you 
please paste those lines into a message that you post here?  
I think they would make good fodder for childlit discussion.
