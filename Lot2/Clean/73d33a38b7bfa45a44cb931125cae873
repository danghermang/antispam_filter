Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Birds at the eclipse
There was a total or near total eclipse in Melbourne some time in the 70s(?), in the afternoon, I think. I recall that it was like a dawn chorus when it got light again. Perhaps your observation that the birds "carried on as before" was because they were already doing their dawn chorus.
