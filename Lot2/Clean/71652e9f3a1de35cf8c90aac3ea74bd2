Possibly such experiments should be announced in advance in the future,
so that everyone can know what is going on. Ideally a pointer to a web
page with full details about the experiment, but at least just a quick
mail to the routing working group (and the IPv6 working group in
cases where appropriate) seems reasonable.

If this is something that requires a policy change I'd be happy to push
it forward.
