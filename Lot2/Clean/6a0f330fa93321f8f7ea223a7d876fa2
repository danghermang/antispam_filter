Subject:[Hsqldb-user] Shutdown Compact with low xmx
Hi All,

I have been doing some experimentation with different xmx settings and
cache sizes to try and find a good balance between memory usage and
performance.
I have it so that a reasonably large database will run with a fairly
low memory footprint, however, when I try to run a SHUTDOWN COMPACT it
will cause the memory usage to rise considerably and often exceeds xmx
resulting in out of memory exceptions.
As far as my understanding goes, a shutdown compact will result in a
smaller file on disk than the standard shutdown command which makes
offsite backups for us much easier.
Is there a way to perform a shutdown compact without the excessive memory usage?

Cheers,
Dean
