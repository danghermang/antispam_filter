Subject:[Jukebox-list] Wurlitzer 1500 and some thoughts
I wish people especially jukebox lovers wouldn't perpetuate the myth that
the loveable 1500 is a devil's device and can't be made to work.
The rumour spread when the 1500 came out that it wasn't operating properly
and would jam.
Wurlitzer had to redesign, add a cam and a couple microswitches so the mech
would reverse and lock the selected tray in position. They even had to come
out with a service manual supplement in mid year.
I have never seen a 1500 without the update.
For the next season, the 'Wurlimagic' Brain was announced to work "better
than ever" in the brochure. Their engineers must have felt morethan a
little sheepish while Seeburg was taking over the market with the their
modern and ultra reliable machines.
Take just the fact that the A and B only needed one flourescent to light
everything up....

But the 1500 series wasn't that bad.

One operator Jim Smith in San Antonio took advantage of the situation and
stocked up with unwanted Wurlitzer 1500s. He had at one time over 120 on
location. Some remained there until the late eighties, when I went around
town with him to collect the take. He groaned when someone had just kicked
in a pilaster on a 1500A in a diner (this was in 1989).
I asked about their rep for being unreliable - "not really" he said. "You
just need to know them well and check the adjustments after moving them"
"Then they will run forever." "I have ran these for soon forty years,
nothing to it".

I ended up buying 16 of them. Carried them out from a derelict warehouse on
a 100F+ day with fire ants all over the yard.
Ouch.
A jukebox afficionado will probably want to showcase the machine's unique
ability to play 45s and 78s intermixed.
An operator never did that. That means the enthusiast will need to be extra
careful with the adjustments.
One trick Jim Smith showed me was using loctite on the cam pins, to keep
everything tight for a long time.

Granted the Wurlitzers from 1250 up to 1650 weren't the best sounding
machines. Those tiny turntables weren't providing a good support for the
discs, and flutter would be noticeable esp on 45s.

I think the Rockola 1436 Fireball was the real dog. Just the idea of
putting 60 fragile shellac 78s in a ferris wheel!
At the same time it was a great innovation and one of very few to come from
Rockola
Operator Ron Rood in Orlando told me he called the factory and said "what
the h--- is this" when he received a truckload of them. After they sent him
another load he quit Rockola and went with AMI. (on 45s the ferris wheel
mech evolved into good working machines).

Design variations on the 1500 - I have seen them with the grill rods either
plated or painted red/blue.
A few rare ones had the aluminum grill itself chromed, making it a real
bling machine.
I think I've seen only three of those over the years.

A 1500 is a tinkerers delight!
What is a collector looking for if not for something rare and unique?
Wurlitzer 1500 offers both.
I always found (in spite of being Swedish) the overhyped Seeburg mech
action to be on the dull side.
Reliability isn't everything (well maybe for an operator).
Carousels, ferris wheels and the old 24 players are much more entertaining.
The Wurlitzer 1500 puts on quite a show!
