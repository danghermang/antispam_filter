Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] What bird is this #1
Actually Tony it is an immature Oriole and not a juvenile.  The pale 
eye-brow is not present in juveniles.  Many people (and field guides) 
confuse the terms 'juvenile' and 'immature'.  A juvenile bird is one that is 
still in the plumage that it had at time of fledging whereas an immature has 
moulted from its juvenile plumage, although it may retain some juvenile 
feathers.
