Subject:Re: [Koha] Improving the advanced search form
Dear All, 

I agree with the same, I always had problem in advance search especially for
the barcode based search.

Even if I select the barcode as search option and enter the specific barcode
number, Koha opac always show all the titles wherever that specific number
is entered. But other that the barcode number. 

Is there any solution for the same?

Thanks and Regards

Hi there,

I am currently working on improving accessibility of koha opac site with our
accessibility expert.
One of the things we noticed is that the advanced search option is not only
confusing for blind users but also even for normal users.

I have noticed the following issues with it:

1) By default the Fewer Options option is selected, which is not obvious to
the normal users until they click on More Options.

2) The layout could be a lot better, in particular the Fewer Options search
form is quite abstract in what it does.

For example, the default boolean operator is AND which is not obvious to
even normal user.

In my opinion, layout similar to the one http://kea.massey.ac.nz/search/X,
is better.

Looking forward to your comments/feedback.

Srikanth

I'm going to disagree and say that site is horrid :)

Maybe others will have different opinions though.

Agree advanced search could and should be improved, but don't like example
suggested.

I generallly like the "look: of the Koha advanced search page. The problem
(apart from any accessibility issues) is that some functions don't work as
one might expect - as outlined below. Also:

We would like to turn off or limit languages to onees that are actually
available in our catalog.

The Search for additional content types is really misleading as it relies on
codes from marc field 008 which may or may not have been used.
I'm sure I have other issues with this screen and I would be keen to discuss
any improvements further. We support anything that makes it more accessible
too.  Gay

Dear Dennis, 

I believe you are missing MARC tag 952 series, 952 is the local tags which
contain all the information about the holding. For example.

952$8$9$a$b$c$g$h$p$y
$8 is for collection code
$9 is for biblio number
$a is for permanent location
$b is for current location
$c is for shelf location
$g is for purchase price (you can include the vendor name, location and
invoice details also here) $h is for volume details of the resources mainly
it is used for the journal/magazine/periodicals $p is for the barcode $y is
for the item type

Once you have all the required information in 952 series you can convert the
file into marc format and upload the same to koha, as the standard process. 

Thanks and Regards

Message-ID: <96D8A573-0DC3-478B-BA5C-CBD5FD9974A5@westnet.com.au>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi,

This is going sound pathetic, and stupid, but I'm in need of some guidance.
It has been quite some time since I've tried to use koha.

I've been upgrading my koha from 3.00 towards 3.8 via the tarball method.

I was attempting to be good, and going in smallish steps so 3.00 to 3.02 to
3.04 to 3.06 and then to 3.8.

In between each upgrade I was trying a few searches to make sure that the
books end of the db was intact and then backing up the DB.

After the 3.06 step it seemed to be working.

But, after the 3.8 step suddenly most of the books seem to have vanished.

I'd put it down to noticing in the upgrade notes some extra steps that I
didn't see in the 3.6 or 3.4 notes (the ones about removing the duplicated
item details). So I dropped the DB and reloaded the backup from the 3.6 step
and tried without these steps.

I've also now tried the original backup too, without success.

I'm not sure at this point if it's the items that have vanished or the
records too. Yes, I have run rebuild_zebra -b -r as the koha user (several
times no luck).

So I suppose I'm looking for guidance on
a) working out what is going on.
b) how to get normality back again.

-ramon.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I'm trying to catch duplicate items in data before I upload it (ISBN won't
help in this case). In order to do that I've written a report to list the
books currently in Koha, and will compare them with my external files.
 However, if I can't include the subtitle (MARC 245 b) I will get too many
false positives (we have lots of things with the same title, but different
subtitles)
It would also help if I could  also have the 250 a (edition)


This is what I have:
SELECT
 
biblio.biblionumber,biblio.author,biblio.title,biblio.copyrightdate,biblioit
ems.place,biblioitems.publishercode,biblioitems.isbn
FROM items
 LEFT JOIN biblioitems on
(items.biblioitemnumber=biblioitems.biblioitemnumber)
LEFT JOIN biblio on (biblioitems.biblionumber=biblio.biblionumber)
WHERE items.itype='BK' AND items.holdingbranch='VWML'
ORDER BY biblio.author asc


This works fine, but doesn't include the 245 b or the 250 a  Can anyone
help?

I think in this case you need to make the report using the xml field in
biblio items table because the rest of sub fields you will find there

Subject: [Koha] Help needed with report - how to extract subtitle and
edition?
Date: Wed, Oct 24, 2012 11:23 pm


I'm trying to catch duplicate items in data before I upload it (ISBN won't
help in this case). In order to do that I've written a report to list the
books currently in Koha, and will compare them with my external files.
 However, if I can't include the subtitle (MARC 245 b) I will get too many
false positives (we have lots of things with the same title, but different
subtitles)
It would also help if I could  also have the 250 a (edition)


This is what I have:
SELECT
 
biblio.biblionumber,biblio.author,biblio.title,biblio.copyrightdate,biblioit
ems.place,biblioitems.publishercode,biblioitems.isbn
FROM items
 LEFT JOIN biblioitems on
(items.biblioitemnumber=biblioitems.biblioitemnumber)
LEFT JOIN biblio on (biblioitems.biblionumber=biblio.biblionumber)
WHERE items.itype='BK' AND items.holdingbranch='VWML'
ORDER BY biblio.author asc


This works fine, but doesn't include the 245 b or the 250 a  Can anyone
help?
