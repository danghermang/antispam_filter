Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Bertrand interview in the Times
Why is that weird? What is so strange with interests of a slightly intellectual character? It is probably true that you don't have to be extremely clever to become a professional footballer, but I can't see any reason at all for why proficiency in football and having some kind of academic interest should be mutually exclusive. Maybe it was not comme-il-faut to admit it in the days of GLS, but it that case, THAT is weird.
