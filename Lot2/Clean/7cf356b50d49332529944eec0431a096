Subject:[CT Birds] Bluff Point prediction, last decent push?
Atmospheric conditions and surface wind predictions look right for another
good flight at Bluff Point's hot corner tomorrow morning. It will be mostly
Yellow-rumped Warblers and White-throated Sparrows, but this is prime time
for immature Orange-crowned Warbler. There should be another good push of
Juncos, Robins, and finches tomorrow, including some more Evening Grosbeaks.
This is likely the last sizable flight of the usual migrants, as most birds
have moved at least this far southward at this point. Of course we are in
prime time for state or regional rarities as well.
