Subject:[Dixielandjazz] GARY CHURCH UPDATE 10/25/2012





Good morning!
 
Yesterday, Gary was seen by Neuro-Team of five Doctors from 
Barrows.
 
CT Scan and MRI of head was good and also vitals where good.  

 
They believe Gary has a type of headache called "TRIGERMINAL 
AUTONOMIC CEPHALGIA".
 
They are trying a medicine to prevent this from ever 
happening.  The medicine is called "INDMETHACIN".
 
Doctors may have a trial and error period if this doesn't 
work.  They have other medicines to try until it works for Gary.  Seems like 
they are on the right track!
 
Unfortunately, this medicine is bad for a heart 
patient.
 
If this does work,  Gary will come home 
today.
 
They are going to wait and see if his severe "10" pain will 
happen today.
 
Thanks from Gary and I....your nice comments help get through 
this!
 
Love & God Bless!
