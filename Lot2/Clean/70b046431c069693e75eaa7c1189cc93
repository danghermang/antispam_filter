Subject:[Flexradio] MOX button and TX audio in 2.4.4 ?
I normally use a boom mike and footswitch with my 5000A, but
occasionally like to click the MOX button for PTT on/off.

Somewhere along the way, TX audio disappeared when using the MOX button.
It keys the radio, but no output on SSB and just carrier on AM. This is 
with PSDR 2.4.4 .

Does anyone's installation work with the MOX button, or am I just 
deluded that it ever worked that way at all?

For other reasons, I've swapped out that shack PC and imported a copy of 
the database made with the "Export" function on the other machine. Right 
or wrong it still behaves the same way.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Jim N7CXI
