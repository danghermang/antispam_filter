Subject:[CT Birds] Both crossbills - Hammonasett
Hammonasett nov 11 2:45pm

Observed good sized flocks of both red and white-winged crossbills actively feeding in the pines at the West End parking lot.  Reds were in the pines just to the left of the path going out to the beach.  White-winged were all over.

Estimate about 20 Red Crossbills and 45 White-winged in several groups.
