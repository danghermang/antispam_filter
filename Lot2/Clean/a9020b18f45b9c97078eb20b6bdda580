Yes, I'd prefer he stayed behind the striker when the odds are against him getting the ball. And I'd rather he not get turned like Cahill was. 
At least in Cahill's case he was close enough to make a second attempt. Luiz's move takes him out of the play. 
I get your point that all defenders get turned sometimes, even JT, but few turn themselves like Luiz.

Instead, Van Persie turned him and raced on to fire a shot straight at Cech. No goal, but the opening was made by Luiz's totally unnecessary move. He does this so often. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. When you're a defender those odds aren't good enough.
