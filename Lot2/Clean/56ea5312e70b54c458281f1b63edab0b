Subject:[Birding-Aus] Dusky Wood Swallow domestic arrangements
Here's a question that occurred to me watching our local small group of
DWSs.

In large breeding flocks it's difficult to see, but when you have smaller
numbers DWss usually seem to be in multiples of three. Is this a male and
two females (or vice versa), or a pair and an offspring from last year
helping them with this year's breeding?
