Subject:[Flexradio] =?utf-8?q?PSDR_and_Windows_8_upgrade?=

All,

Considering the inexpensive upgrade to Windows 8, is anyone else considering the move to their Flex PC on October 26th. 

I am wondering what the advantages of the OS will be over say Win7-64. 

I wonder about compatibility with 3rd party Flex applications.

73,
Robert
