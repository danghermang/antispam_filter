I know multiple networks like that. The one that ran out of public IPv4 =
space is now doing NAT444 with 100.64.0.0/10 combined with 6rd. It's =
certainly not pretty, but it is easy to convert an existing 'ethernet =
all the way' network to this by adding a set of central NAT boxes and a =
set of 6rd border relays. The existing IPv4 infrastructure doesn't have =
to change. You do need to supply 6rd capable CPEs to customers, but =
those are available from many vendors these days.
