How biblical. Reminds me of the story when Christ got mad when they were selling goods and prostitutes outside the temple.

Larry has always recognized the need for individuals and entities to be able to sustain themselves. The practice of gifting at the events is intended to remind us of to be mindful of our transactions, to value the interpersonal nature that they can-should consist of. This builds community. You will see the BM Project affiliate itself with events or undertakings where those involved sell things, and not just ice or coffee. But it's commerce that seeks to build or sustain community not one
