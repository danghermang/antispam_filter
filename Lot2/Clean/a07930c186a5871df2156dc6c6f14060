Hernandez makes weary Blues pay for off-day

Swansea City 1 Chelsea 1

Steve Tongue

Liberty Stadium



A pale and uneventful game involving Chelsea? Surely not.

For a long time the most colourful thing about an afternoon of
alternating rain and sun in South Wales was a rainbow above the
halfway line. That would not have bothered Roberto Di Matteo at the
end of another hectic week, once Victor Moses headed the goal that was
keeping his team on top of the Premier League. Then, with two minutes
to play, Swansea=92s Spanish midfielder Pablo Hernandez drove in an
equaliser that left Manchester United, who had beaten Chelsea last
Sunday, on top of the pile.

It was deserved reward for the Welsh side=92s refusal to give up on
their neat passing game, even if they sometimes fell into the trap of
making it just too intricate. They gained greater momentum once Danny
Graham was called off the substitutes=92 bench after Moses had scored,
allowing Michu to drop a little deeper into his more natural position.
Equally deserved, it might be said, was Chelsea=92s fate, given that
they created so little, especially in the second half. Once the goal
went in, they seemed to take it for granted that victory would be
theirs.

Without Juan Mata, so often the midfield fulcrum, there had been a
lackadaisical air about much of their work. Di Matteo showed his
displeasure by removing the ineffective Oriel Romeu at half-time and
sending on Ramires, who he had hoped to hold in reserve for
Wednesday=92s Champions=92 League game at home to Shakhtar Donetsk.

The manager declined to admit that the performance was well below par,
though he did agree that fatigue may be kicking in amid the
twice-weekly schedule and international games. As to whether all the
off-field drama that seems to surround Chelsea had any effect, he
insisted: =93I wouldn=92t read anything into that.=94

There was notable and possibly pointed praise for the referee, Kevin
Friend, of whom Di Matteo said: =93He did very well and kept the players
calm and I congratulate him. It takes something out of the ordinary
for my players to react.=94

Swansea=92s Michael Laudrup, whose son Andreas recently played for
Nordsjaelland in Chelsea=92s flattering 4-0 win over them, was
delighted, all the more so since there had been rumblings about
discontent from some of his players earlier in the season. That was
before a run of games against Manchester City, Liverpool (both away)
and Chelsea that have brought a win, a draw and a defeat. =93It=92s three
very good performances from the team in a great week for the club,=94 he
said. =93We played the champions of Europe and Liverpool at Anfield and
I only counted five or six chances. Their goal today was a little
lucky and it was a deserved point for us.=94

Not only Mata was missing from the Chelsea midfield that has been so
effective for most of the season but Frank Lampard too, and John Terry
in defence. David Luiz, less critically, was injured, so Branislav
Ivanovic and Gary Cahill played in the centre of the back four with
Cesar Azpilicueta at right-back. Between them they kept the home side
at bay with reasonable comfort, although the late goal means it is six
games now without a clean sheet. Early on Hernandez sent the
adventurous and poetic Angel Rangel clear but Ivanovic intercepted his
cut-back and later Wayne Routledge set up Ki Sung-Yueng, Jon Obi Mikel
making an important block.

If Mikel did not appear in any way affected by having been the central
figure in last Sunday=92s drama at Stamford Bridge, Romeu alongside him
was poor and could not complain at being sent to the showers early.
His countryman Fernando Torres had one of his better days, holding up
the ball more reliably and winning several good headers. One of them
brought just about the only excitement of the first half, when he
headed Oscar=92s corner towards the far post, Leon Britton clearing off
the line.

Another Oscar corner led to the goal just after the hour, not without
controversy. Britton was furious to be penalised for a tackle on the
Brazilian, leading to a curling free-kick by Eden Hazard that the
goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel punched for a corner. From that, Cahill
climbed highest for a solid header that Moses managed to flick on and
in off a post for his first Chelsea goal in the League.

Laudrup brought on Graham and Nathan Dyer and the crowd awoke, too,
and if the hymns and arias took on an increasingly desperate tone,
they reached a crescendo as Ashley Cole lost possession, Swansea broke
and the other substitute, Itay Shechter, laid the ball off for
Hernandez to drive low inside a post.

=93I know what Pablo can do,=94 Laudrup said. =93Every foreigner needs time
to adapt to this League and he=92s getting better and better. You have a
big sign on your shoulder saying =91record signing=92 [at =A35.5 million]
and so you have a little more pressure.=94 Hernandez wore it well.

Observer:

Swansea City's Pablo Hern=E1ndez denies Chelsea at the last

Joe Lovejoy at the Liberty Stadium



No controversy here, but no win for Chelsea either, Swansea City
rallying with spirit and conviction to score an 88th-minute equaliser
that leaves Manchester United in pole position in the Premier League.

United took over at the top of the table earlier in the day by beating
Arsenal, and Chelsea were unable to reply in kind. They were denied
the win they needed by Pablo Hern=E1ndez, the striker Swansea signed
from Valencia last summer, who beat Petr Cech with a laser-guided
20-yarder. Remarkably, after Chelsea had been the better team for much
of the game, the Swans might have nicked it at the end, when Danny
Graham, on as substitute, was desperately close with a shot that
shivered the framework of Cech's goal.

After recent events the focus was as much on the referee as the
players. Kevin Friend, of Leicestershire, will have prayed for a
routine assignment, or at least one free of dialogue with Mikel John
Obi. To his relief, he got what he wanted. When Mikel was booked, for
fouling Jonathan De Guzman, there was no drama. To universal relief,
the football was good, constructive stuff, free of histrionics and
post-match accusations. Roberto Di Matteo made a point of praising the
referee. The Chelsea manager said: "I've got to say the officials were
very good. Kevin Friend did very well, he kept the players calm. I
congratulated him at the end."

Asked if he had told his team to behave impeccably in light of the
storm after last Sunday's defeat by Manchester United, he said: "No, I
didn't think it was necessary to do that. In general, their behaviour
is good."

Both teams were without important players. Injury has deprived Swansea
of Michel Vorm, one of the best goalkeepers in the league, and Chico
Flores at centre-half. Chelsea had John Terry completing his
suspension and another of their old guard, Frank Lampard, plus David
Luiz and their player of the season to date, Juan Mata, all
casualties.

Opportunity knocked for Garry Monk, the Welsh club's long-serving club
captain, who will have enjoyed his first appearance of the season in
the Premier League as Flores' deputy. Chelsea's most interesting
selection was Victor Moses, who caught the managerial eye in the
midweek cup victory over Manchester United, and justified his
inclusion as Mata's deputy by scoring with a header after an hour.

Chelsea had the better of the first half in terms of possession and
chances created, their best goal attempt seeing a header from Fernando
Torres cleared off the line by Leon Britton after a corner taken on
the left by the man of the match, Eden Hazard. For a long time
Swansea, as is their custom, played some lovely, cohesive football,
but without seriously inconveniencing Cech. Chelsea ought to have
scored after 50 minutes, when Torres delivered an inviting cross from
near the byline on the left, only for his work to be wasted when Moses
headed weakly over the bar from six yards. The young winger quickly
made amends.

Chelsea's chance seemed to have gone when Gerhard Tremmel flew to his
left to turn behind a curling 25-yard free-kick from Hazard, but from
the corner Gary Cahill's header reached Moses who, at the near post,
headed in at close range, via the top of the upright. Michael Laudrup
sent on Nathan Dyer and Graham and switched to 4-2-4 in search of
renewed equality, and boldness had its reward when Itay Shechter, on
as substitute, supplied Hern=E1ndez, who ran on before shooting into the
left corner of Cech's net.

Di Matteo, naturally, was disappointed to have his team knocked off
the top for the first time since the table meant anything. He said:
"After the week we've had, it would have been good to finish it off
with a 1-0 victory. We had more of the game and they didn't create
many chances but we lacked a cutting edge today. All right, we're not
top any more but it's only November and it's a long season. We're in
touch and we're going to show how strong we are in the future."

He admitted it was nice to be talking about football rather than
discipline and off the field events. "That's how it should be every
week," he said. "I wish it was."

Asked if recent controversies had adversely affected his team's form,
Di Matteo said: "I wouldn't read anything into all that. Away games in
the Premier League are always difficult."

Chelsea expect to have Mata, fit again in time for Wednesday's
Champions League tie at home to Shakhtar Donetsk. Terry will be
available but Di Matteo will assess his match fitness before deciding
if he plays.

Telegraph:


Swansea City 1 Chelsea 1

By Jonathan Liew, at Liberty Stadium


With verve and spirit, with resolve and dedication, and in weather fit
for Swans, the home side deservedly seized a point against the
champions of Europe, shifting them from the Premier League summit in
the process.

Three minutes from time, the Spanish international and club record
signing Pablo Hernandez made himself a little space on the edge of the
Chelsea penalty area, spotted a gap amidst the maze of blue socks and
coloured boots, and curled the ball right into it.

Drenched and downtrodden, Chelsea=92s players stared forlornly at each
other. This time there was no referee to blame. Champion sides are
generally the ones scoring late goals, not conceding them.

In the corresponding fixture 10 months ago, they burgled a draw
courtesy of an own goal in the third minute of injury time. This time,
the last-gasp heartbreak was theirs.

Chelsea were not poor, exactly, but rarely did they sparkle either.
Without the injured Juan Mata and David Luiz, they looked
uncharacteristically short on flair.

Their goal was a scrappy slice of luck from a second-half corner. No
alarms yet, but after one win in four games and no clean sheets in the
last six, a crack or two is beginning to appear in Roberto di Matteo=92s
formidable edifice.

=93To be honest, they didn=92t have any real clear chances, but they
scored a quality goal,=94 he said.

=93The only time we gave Hern=E1ndez a bit of space, he punished us. It is
disappointing not to have hung on to our lead. Even when you are not
brilliant, you need to get a result like that.=94

The league table remains of limited concern to him. =93It=92s a long
season,=94 he said. =93We are in touch.=94

Still, Di Matteo=92s dismay was mitigated by the fact that he was
finally able to talk about football again, after a week in which
off-field matters have again cast their acrid shadow. In contrast to
his indignation at Mark Clattenburg last weekend, he gave the referee
a glowing report.

=93The officials were very good,=94 he said. =93Kevin Friend did very well
to keep both teams calm and let the game flow. Generally our team is
very good [with officials]. There has to be something really out of
the ordinary for them to react.=94

Besides a few early boos for John Obi Mikel, the man at the centre of
the Clattenburg affair, the Swansea City fans were also quick to move
on to more pressing matters.

They were regally entertained in a taut, even first half, the two
sides=92 identical formations creating a delicate balance in midfield.

Fernando Torres had one header cleared off the line by Leon Britton,
and fired another straight at Gerhard Tremmel. The Spaniard has now
gone almost seven hours without a goal for club or country.

It was going to take either genius or good fortune to break the
deadlock, and Chelsea benefited from the latter. Oscar=92s corner was
nodded towards goal by Gary Cahill, took a deflection off the head of
Victor Moses, and clattered in off the post.

Swansea continued to press, though without much of a product. The
introduction of striker Danny Graham, though, finally gave their
attacks a focal point.

With Graham pushing Chelsea=92s centre-halves back a couple of yards,
Swansea were able to find more space on the edge of the area, in the
spaces manager Michael Laudrup calls 'the second line=92.

With time leaking away, Ramires took his eye off Hern=E1ndez for a split
second, allowing the Spaniard to make a run and latch onto Itay
Schechter=92s lay-off. His shot was low and perfectly placed.

=93A team like Chelsea have a lot of quality,=94 Laudrup said. =93When they
get in front, you know it is going to be difficult. I really thought
we had a chance until the last second. I think it was a deserved
point.=94

Swansea 1 Chelsea 1:

Pacy Swansea take their time but snatch a point

Ron Lewis



A deserved late equaliser by Pablo Hernandez gave Swansea City a
hard-fought point that put a dent in Chelsea=92s title hopes.

Swansea had caused Chelsea problems with their pace, but when Victor
Moses had headed the London side ahead just after the hour, it seemed
likely they would close out the victory. But as Chelsea tried to run
out time, Swansea showed a never-say-die spirit to become only the
third side this season to deny Chelsea all three points.

It had not been a vintage display by Chelsea, but at the end of a
difficult week, a cold afternoon in South Wales in a match played amid
heavy downpours looked like a shock to the system. Chelsea simply
could not subdue the Swansea threat and the home team could have
picked up all three points but for a late Gary Cahill block on Danny
Graham=92s shot that then struck a post.

Swansea made a quick start, Angel Rangel, Wayne Routledge and
Hernandez all stretching the Chelsea defence by attacking down the
flanks. From a corner, Fernando Torres=92s header were cleared at the
far post by Leon Britton, but, at the other end, an excellent run and
cross from Hernandez found Michu, who was unable to get an effort on
target.

Chelsea=92s chief threat was coming from Moses, running at the Swansea
defence at pace from deep. After 26 minutes, Chelsea=92s first good
chance fell to Torres.

Cahill=92s long ball was brilliantly taken down by the Spaniard, who fed
the ball to Moses on the right. When his shot across Gerhard Tremmel
was palmed away by the Swansea goalkeeper, it bounced up to Torres,
who could get no power on the header and merely directed it back into
Tremmel=92s arms.

Just before half-time, another long ball started another dangerous
break for the visiting team. Torres flicked the ball to Eden Hazard,
who returned to Torres on the left. But with Swansea chasing back to
cover, the forward could not feed the ball back across to Hazard

The half-time introduction of Ramires =96 who had presumably been left
on the bench as he faced being suspended for next week=92s match against
Liverpool if booked =96 in place of the ineffectual Oriol Romeu, showed
that Roberto Di Matteo, the Chelsea head coach, was not happy.

Within moments of the restart, Hazard had forced a save from Tremmel
and Moses had seen a header land on the roof of the net. Swansea
looked most threatening when counter-attacking and it needed Ashley
Cole to poke the ball away from Michu, as the Spanish striker looked
to shoot, while Petr Cech had to dive bravely at Michu=92s feet to deny
him.

Tremmel was once again forced into action, with a spectacular save to
push away a Hazard free kick after a soft foul on Oscar. But from the
resulting corner, taken by Oscar, Chelsea edged ahead. Gary Cahill
rose high to head the ball goalwards and Moses cleverly diverted his
header into the net.

Swansea responded with aggressive intent, replacing Leon Britton with
Danny Graham up front and introducing the fresh legs of Nathan Dyer
down the right wing. Dyer had a part in the build-up as Jonathan de
Guzman forced a save from Cech, with a curving shot from the edge of
the area. Dyer then tried an audacious chip from 25 yards, which Cech
flipped over.

Chelsea, though, seemed content with what they had and were looking to
run out time. But when Cole gave the ball away after a throw-in with
three minutes remaining, Swansea broke in numbers. Hernandez found
Itay Shechter on the edge of the area, who created space for Hernandez
to fire into the bottom corner of the net.

Swansea 1 Chelsea 1: Hernandez seals point for Swans to keep Blues off the =
top

By Nick Harris


Chelsea have spent seven days trading blows with Manchester United, on
and off the pitch, but it was Pablo Hernandez=92s equaliser for Swansea
that means they will spend at least a week off the top of the Premier
League table =97 for the first time since August.

United put Chelsea=92s place on the perch in peril seven days ago with
that acrimonious 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge, which then erupted into
the racism row involving referee Mark Clattenburg.

In midweek the two clubs met in the Capital One Cup and traded nine
goals over 120 minutes, but with further scandal fomenting in the
stands as a Chelsea fan was photographed apparently making a monkey
gesture towards United striker Danny Welbeck.

United=92s manager Sir Alex Ferguson then came out in support of
Clattenburg on Friday, and watched his team beat Arsenal to grab pole
position in the league.

And although Chelsea looked like ending a turbulent and depressing
week on a high note after Victor Moses put them ahead at the Liberty
Stadium, their thunder was stolen by the day=92s most consistently
impressive player, the 27-year-old winger Hernandez.

The home crowd departed delirious in the driving rain with a
tho-roughly deserved point to savour, albeit one gained from visitors
who for long periods lacked the flair they have displayed for much of
the season.

=91It would have been great to finish the week with a 1-0 victory but we
conceded a late equaliser,=92 said Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo.
=91They didn=92t have many chances . . . but they scored a quality goal.=92

The strike that earned Swansea a point arrived after a period of
sustained pressure and with Hernandez increasingly a threat. He ran
towards the box with the ball, laid it off to Itay Shechter and moved
to a more central position to collect the return pass before slotting
it home. =91It was a deserved point,=92 said Swansea boss Michael Laudrup.

=91In many ways it was a copy of the game we played last week against
Manchester City, when we deserved a point and didn=92t get it [losing
1-0].=92

 He added it was =91a game of few chances=92 and that a point apiece was
=91a fair result=92, not least as his team had been faithful to their
tiki-taka passing style.

=91If we can play like that against the big teams, our way, that=92s
important,=92 he said. =91With a team like Chelsea, they have a lot of
quality and when they get in front you know it=92s going to be
difficult.=92

Hernandez joined from Valencia in August for =A35.55m, making him the
most expensive purchase in Swansea=92s history, and giving him the
burden of =91a big sign on his shoulder=92, said Laudrup, who picked the
Spaniard out for special praise.

=91Nearly every foreigner coming into this league will need time to
adapt and I knew that [when I bought Hernandez],=92 he said. =91But he=92s
getting better and better, adapting to the football here. He=92s not
going to score 15 goals a season but he will score goals.=92

 For a player used to the warmth of the Spanish coast and the delights
of the Balearic Sea, a wet, miserable afternoon on the Gower Peninsula
might not be the ideal environment to shine. But Hernandez did, right
up until the final whistle blew in a stadium lashed with biting rain.

The hosts provided much of the illumination all afternoon, and had the
first chance when Michu=92s early shot was blocked by Branislav
Ivanovic.

Chelsea then wasted a free-kick when Oscar blasted it into the Swansea
wall and were then thwarted from a corner when a header from Fernando
Torres was cleared off the line by Leon Britton.

Hernandez dashed down the right and played a perfectly weighted chip
into the path of Michu, whose well-timed run took him between
Chelsea=92s central defenders. But rather than strike the ball neatly,
Michu made an awkward connection and hoofed it clear of goal.

Eden Hazard, a creative marvel since joining in the summer, was
subdued in the first half, one blazed shot over the bar from 20 yards
being his most significant contribution in that first period.

The Belgian warmed up after the break, skipping down the left in the
50th minute, passing to Moses, collecting the return, working his way
to a shooting position and then smacking goalwards a low, right-foot
shot that required a diving save from Gerhard Tremmel.

Moments later Moses headed over from Torres and then momentum swung
back to Swansea, Michu fluffing a chance when he could not keep his
footing.

Hazard had a free-kick punched clear before the opener, from a corner,
with Gary Cahill=92s downward header steered upwards and into goal off
the post by Moses=92s head. A few Chelsea fans spilled out of their
seats on to the perimeter of the pitch. That incident was quickly
handled by stewards, who led one visiting supporter away.

Swansea responded by sticking to their game plan =97 and it ended
successfully with Hernandez=92s goal.

Swansea City 1-1 Chelsea: Late Pablo Hernandez equaliser knocks the
Blues off the top of the table

by Ken Gorman



Victor Moses had given Di Matteo's men the lead on 61 minutes but the
hosts grabbed a late goal to take a share of the points

Chelsea=92s turbulent week ended in last-gasp despair as they were
knocked off the top of the Premier League.

They had proudly held that spot since the second week of the season,
fighting off the twin challenge from Manchester.

With just three minutes left at the rain-soaked Liberty, it seemed
that the Londoners had survived the storm to re-establish their lead
over Manchester United, winners earlier in the day.

But then Swansea=92s spirited late revival earned its reward when Pablo
Hernandez turned sharply on to Itay Shechter=92s pass, picking his spot
with a perfectly-struck drive to leave Petr Cech helpless.

It was a great moment for the Spaniard, Swansea=92s record signing, who
is beginning to justify the =A35.5million they spent to bring him from
Valencia.

But for trouble-torn Chelsea, it was a hammer blow. Cruel maybe =96
Roberto Di Matteo=92s team had just about edged the game. But credit
Swansea for refusing to buckle.

And at least this was an afternoon when the drama of the game was the
only issue. After the fall-out from their racist row with Mark
Clattenburg, everybody will welcome that.

None more so than Di Matteo. =93Of course we are disappointed to give
away that late goal, but it is nice to be talking about the football
and nothing else,=94 he said.

=93I felt we were generally the better team =96 I don=92t think Swansea had
a single chance until they scored.=94

Di Matteo is not too downhearted about losing top spot though. He
insisted: =93There is a long way to go and the situation will remain
tight right the way through.=94

Swansea boss Michael Laudrup made the same point.

=93Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City... they will remain the
top three teams. Who wins? Nobody can be sure right now.=94

Laudrup hailed goal hero Hernandez, declaring: =93It takes any foreign
player time to settle in the Premier League.

=93Pablo is getting better all the time, not just scoring but in his
general play. I knew the talent he has. Now he is showing it.=94

Di Matteo had insisted before the game that the off-field sagas had
not affected his team=92s focus. And Chelsea certainly started brightly.

They came close to forging ahead after 12 minutes, when Fernando
Torres met Eden Hazard=92s corner with a near post header that left
Gerhard Tremmel helpless, only for the ever-alert Leon Britton to hook
the ball off the line.

Swansea=92s fluent passing style has been a feature since they reached
the Premier League. And with this current Chelsea team loaded with
skill, nobody could dispute the quality of the game.

What was lacking though was the frenzied, helter-skelter drama that
makes the big league such a compelling spectacle.

We had barely seen a tackle in anger until referee Kevin Friend felt
it was time to get out his yellow card after 36 minutes, cautioning
Britton =96 harshly =96 for a strong challenge on Hazard.

Cesar Azpilicueta, making his first start for the Londoners, followed
him into the book three minutes later, for a mistimed tackle on Wayne
Routledge.

Maybe Friend had become a trifle bored at having such an easy game to contr=
ol.

Chelsea always carried that extra thrust and they really began to turn
the screw in the second half.

Tremmel, deputising for the injured Michel Vorm, did well to push out
a sharp shot from the industrious Hazard. And he was Swansea=92s saviour
again on the hour, leaping across his line to tip over a fierce Hazard
free-kick .

But he was powerless to stop Chelsea taking the lead from the
resultant corner. Hazard=92s cross was headed goalwards by Gary Cahill
for Victor Moses to cleverly flick it on into the net.

The game had cried out for a goal. And Laudrup reacted by increasing
his own fire power, sending on Danny Graham and Nathan Dyer.

The latter was quickly into the action, forcing Cech to push over his
first-time shot.

There was a much greater tempo and intensity about the game now, a
sudden hail storm sweeping over the Liberty adding to the spectacle.

And it was Swansea=92s fans who were able to sing in the rain as they
snatched that dramatic leveller three minutes from time.

Sun:


Swansea 1 Chelsea 1

By MARK IRWIN


PABLO HERNANDEZ struck a blow for refs everywhere as he claimed the
late equaliser to knock Chelsea off the top.

And few were probably cheering louder than Mark Clattenburg as
Swansea=92s =A36million record buy brought the European Champions back
down to earth.

Hernandez=92s 88th-minute shot from the edge of the box crept in beyond
the reach of Petr Cech with the slightest of touches off John Obi
Mikel.

Mikel, of course, is the player Clattenburg is accused of abusing with
=91inappropriate language=92 during last Sunday=92s stormy 3-2 defeat by
Manchester United.

But Chelsea could have no complaints this time as they surrendered
victory right at the death with no one to blame but themselves. The
paranoid among the travelling supporters might not have seen it that
way, though.

For them, the appointment of Kevin Friend as referee could only mean
one thing =97 the Premier League was getting its revenge for
Clattenburg.

Friend is the only current top-flight official who has taken charge of
more Chelsea defeats than victories.

He is also the man who sent off Branislav Ivanovic during their
Community Shield defeat by Manchester United AND was also in charge
when they were hammered 4-1 at Liverpool last season.

So when he inadvertently blocked Ashley Cole=92s early cross to earn the
wrath of the England left-back, it was the smoking gun to prove
Friend=92s guilt beyond all doubt for the travelling fans.

Roberto Di Matteo=92s men thought they had done enough to see off the
graceful Swans when Victor Moses headed them ahead in his first league
start for the club.

But the days of Chelsea closing a game out once they get their noses
in front are a thing of the past and once again they paid the price.

Swansea will argue Hernandez=92s late strike meant justice was done
after Chelsea had escaped with a 1-1 draw from the Liberty last season
thanks to a last-minute own goal by Neil Taylor.

And it would be hard to argue with that assessment on an afternoon
when neither team really did enough to deserve all three points.

Manchester United=92s early victory over Arsenal meant that, for the
first time all season, the Blues were off the top when they kicked
off.

And it soon became apparent this was not going to be a stroll back to
the summit for a team who have now conceded 10 goals during captain
John Terry=92s four-match suspension.

They could have fallen behind as early as the third minute when Angel
Rangel got round the back of the Chelsea defence but just failed to
pick out the lurking Michu with his low cross.

Another Swansea chance went begging when Michu stretched to reach
Hernandez=92s chip over the top but hooked his attempted volley out for
a throw-in.

And without the injured Juan Mata, there was a disturbing lack of
inspiration from a Chelsea side who had been sweeping all before them
until United ended their unbeaten run.

Not that the visitors were poor. Just pretty average.

Fernando Torres had an early header cleared off the line by Leon
Britton and Eden Hazard lashed a good chance over.

Their best first-half opportunity, though, came when keeper Gerhard
Tremmel could only push Moses=92 fierce cross-shot into the path of the
incoming Torres.

But the =A350million striker=92s tame header lacked power and was
comfortably saved by Tremmel. It was yet another of those unconvincing
afternoons for Britain=92s most expensive footballer and another chance
went begging just before the break when he was sent clear by Hazard.

With a pack of Swansea defenders in desperate pursuit, Torres had
neither the speed nor the confidence to go all the way and was
dispossessed without even getting a shot off.

But the introduction of Ramires as a half-time sub for the pedestrian
Oriol Romeu gave Chelsea more urgency and they finally made the
breakthrough in the 61st minute.

Hazard=92s dipping free-kick had already brought a flying save from
Tremmel and when Gary Cahill got his head to Oscar=92s corner, Moses was
first to react to divert the ball in off the angle of post and bar.

Yet Chelsea never looked fully in control and as they dropped deeper
to protect their lead an equaliser looked inevitable.

It arrived in the dying seconds when sub Itay Shechter turned in the
area and teed up Hernandez for a low shot from the edge of the area.

Last Sunday it was Javier, this time it was Pablo.

Good job for Chelsea there will be no Hernandez playing for Shakhtar
Donetsk in the Champions League on Wednesday.

SWANSEA 1 - CHELSEA 1: PABLO HERNANDEZ SPOILS CHELSEA DAY

By Phil Cadden


AFTER a turbulent seven days off the field at Chelsea, there was
further difficulty =96 this time on the pitch =96 as Swansea denied them
the chance to regain top spot in the Premier League.

The Blues looked set to overtake rivals Manchester United in the title
race once again, courtesy of Victor Moses=92 first league goal, a
61st-minute header, for Chelsea before Pablo Hernandez=92s curling late
strike secured a share of the points.

Sir Alex Ferguson=92s United had posed the question of Chelsea=92s title
credentials after defeating Arsenal 2-1 in the lunchtime kick-off.

Regardless of the controversy involving referee Mark Clattenburg,
Chelsea seemed to not let it affect them as Roberto Di Matteo=92s outfit
looked set for a return to the summit of the table.

But a solid defensive display for large periods =96 without regular
centre-backs John Terry and David Luiz as well as the injured Juan
Mata =96 was undone in the closing stages as Hernandez seized on Itay
Shechter=92s lay-off to slot the ball past Petr Cech.

And Chelsea could have ended up empty-handed as substitute Danny
Graham was sent clear and looked destined to score only for a
last-ditch tackle by Gary Cahill to foil him.

Di Matteo said: =93It=92s a long season and it is going to stay very tight
at the top. There are a few teams fighting for that. We are in touch
and we are going to show how strong we are in the future.=94

As the teams emerged, the home faithful taunted Chelsea=92s travelling
support with the chant, =91Where=92s your racist centre-half?=92 in
reference to the absent Terry, serving the final game of his
four-match suspension for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand.

And without Terry and Luiz at the heart of Di Matteo=92s defence, Cahill
and Branislav Ivanovic had a rare outing alongside each other.

The hosts almost capitalised on early hesitancy in the Blues backline
as Swansea club-record signing Hernandez set Angel Rangel free. But
the Spanish right-back opted to look for Michu rather than try his
luck as Ivanovic averted the danger.

Yet it didn=92t take Chelsea too long to find their feet. Fernando
Torres saw his near-post header from Eden Hazard=92s left-wing corner
cleared off the line by Leon Britton.

Within 60 seconds Swansea too carved open their first opportunity of
the match. But Michu miscued his volley after Hernandez=92s clipped pass
sliced open Chelsea=92s unusual centre-half pairing.

But as the half wore on, Chelsea began to dominate, with Hazard and
Oscar showing signs of their clever interplay from midfield.

Swansea goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel produced a double save initially to
deny Moses after Ben Davies hesitated to cut out a Chelsea attack
before Torres=92 header was claimed by the German stopper.

John Obi Mikel, at the centre of the allegations against Clattenburg
last weekend, diverted Ki Sung-Yueng=92s goal-bound shot before the
midfielder was lectured by referee Kevin Friend just after the
half-hour mark for pulling back Jonathan de Guzman.

After a comfortable opening for the Leicestershire official, Friend
was heavily involved as he dished out bookings for Britton and
Chelsea=92s rookie full-back Cesar Azpilicueta.

After another sustained spell of pressure by the visitors, Moses broke
the deadlock on the hour mark. Tremmel saved Hazard=92s 25-yard
free-kick, but from Oscar=92s resulting corner, Cahill=92s header was
flicked in via the post by the ex-Wigan winger.

Swansea manager Michael Laudrup responded by introducing Graham and
Nathan Dyer for Britton and Wayne Routledge.

Both players made an impact, Dyer forcing Cech to back-pedal rapidly
in the 74th minute before Hernandez fired home from the edge of the
box, to end a troublesome week for Chelsea on a low note.

Laudrup said: =93Every foreigner coming to this league needs some time
to adapt but I think Pablo is getting better and better,=94.

Di Matteo added: =93The only time we gave Hernandez a bit of space, he
punished us.=94

SWANSEA 1 - CHELSEA 1: HERNANDEZ FIRES BLUES PAB-BLOW

By Harry Pratt


WOW! That=92s two games in a row involving Chelsea that have passed
without any major controversy. Amazing but true.

However, unlike their thrilling 5-4 win over Manchester United in the
League Cup three days earlier, this trip to South West Wales failed to
deliver any repeat of that end-to-end goal-fest.

Not that anyone in Swansea was complaining about such matters after
Pablo Hernandez=92s late equaliser cancelled out Victor Moses=92 strike to
earn them a deserved share of the spoils against high-flying Chelsea.

For Roberto Di Matteo=92s men, though, it was very much a day of mixed
fortunes and emotions.

On the one hand they will be bitterly disappointed that this stalemate
means they are no longer in pole position in the title race =96 with
bitter rivals Manchester United a point clear following their 2-1 win
over Arsenal.

However, on the flip side, they left the Liberty Stadium having not
done any more damage or harm to their badly-battered reputations.

After all, life at the summit is tough enough as it is.

But when you are upsetting all and sundry =96 with racial allegations
against ref Mark Clattenburg =96 it clearly gets a whole harder.

Let=92s face it, rightly or wrongly, the European champions have been on
the receiving end like never before in recent days.

Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger and Neil Warnock, to name but a few,
have launched public broadsides at the club=92s handling of Clattengate.

Yet Chelsea claimed yesterday they have merely followed FA rules to the let=
ter.

Di Matteo felt his side were unfortunate not to bag all three points
but insisted surrendering top spot had nothing to do with the
turbulent events in SW6.

The Italian coach said : =93I wouldn=92t read anything into that. Away
games in this league are always very difficult.

=93Of course, it=92s disappointing not to be league leaders but it=92s a
long season and it=92s going to be very tight.

=93When your opponents score so late you have to think they=92re a bit
lucky. The only time we gave them any space, they punished us.
Hernandez took the equaliser very well but Swansea didn=92t really have
any other chances.=94

And he added: =93It=92s nice to be talking football. I wish it was like
this every week. It=92s a concern to see the players tired but with
these international breaks they barely have time to breathe.=94

Yet whether you love or loathe them =96 and the majority fall into the
latter camp just now =96 few could deny that they are damn good to watch
these days.

Even when they are not at their best, as was the case here, there is
smoothness about their style =96 inspired by Belgium ace Eden Hazard =96
which makes them irresistible.

But by the time the Blues kicked off here they had already been
replaced at the top by United.

And had Swansea hitman Michu taken one of two chances that fell his
way =96 in the 12th and 27th minutes =96 that situation would have
nosedived even further for Di Matteo=92s men.

Those scares were a warning to the Blues defence, who without
suspended John Terry had conceded nine goals in their previous three
games.

Di Matteo had resisted calls to include League Cup hero Daniel
Sturridge, preferring to stick with Fernando Torres instead =96 and
bringing in Moses for crocked Juan Mata.

And that decision nearly paid dividends when the Spanish marksman=92s
near-post header was destined for the far corner until Chelsea fan
Leon Britton cleared off the line.

Hazard=92s run and shot almost broke the deadlock in the 55th minute
before they scored five minutes later.

An inswinging corner was met by Gary Cahill=92s towering header and
there was Moses to divert in off the underside of the bar from close
range.

Swans boss Michael Laudrup shuffled his pack and sparked a change in moment=
um.

And in the 89th minute Swansea got their reward with sub Itay Shechter
setting up Hernandez, who curled a peach of a shot past Petr Cech.

Laudrup, whose side stay in 11th place, said: =93We deserved that. It
was a game of very few chances and a point for each team was a fair
result.

=93Their goal was a little bit lucky but we came back very well in the
last 20 minutes. We put them under a lot of pressure and I always
thought we could score right up until the final seconds.=94
