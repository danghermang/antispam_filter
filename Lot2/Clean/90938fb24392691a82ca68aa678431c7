Subject:Re: [bcp] Calling all Garmin 800 (or any other model) Users for Help

He's sorted though, you can turn off GPS through the menu. Although I also
thought it preferentially took speed/cadence from the sensor. I have a
Powertap and I know that it does there, so it would make sense do to the
same for the sensor.
