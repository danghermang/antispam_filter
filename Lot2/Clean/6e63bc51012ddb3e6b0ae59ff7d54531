Hi Braun As,

Does deliver early, deliver often equal deliver badly? Some Reg
readers think so.

This is what a few of you tell us about agile development:
"Often of a lower standard and the system will inevitably be less
reliable". "If you don't have good people, you're screwed". "It
leads to several wheels being reinvented in disparate ways".

Ouch.

Not everyone agrees though. Perforce doesn't and nor do its clients -=20
small names like Salesforce.com, Pixar and Nvidia. That's why we got
Perforce in the studio to discuss how to do agile properly: why it's
needed, the right way to go about it and how to avoid the mistakes
that hobble it.

He's joined by Dale Vile from Freeform Dynamics who will tell you
what you already told him when he researched it. Hey! Don't blame
Dale, he's an analyst, it's what they do. His slides are world class!

Tim Phillips will be pretending to keep control, and putting your
questions to the panel.

Join us at the link below. It interesting, free, and available to
view on-demand...
