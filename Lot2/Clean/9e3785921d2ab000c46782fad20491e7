Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Barrington Tops NSW (road status?)
I'm not 100% sure if the Gloucester NPWS office will be all that up to date about the status of the road repair. The repair job is not their direct responsibility.  My suggestion is to call the commercial caravan park which is located just before the entrance to the National Park. They are probably much more likely to have a handle on how the repairs are progressing, seeing as it directly impacts to their business.  Their number is (02) 6558 3155.

Hi Charles,

Jim is correct in that the major slip has been fixed but there appears to be a "new" issue now. I do not have first hand experience with this but here is some text from an email that Alan Stuart sent to the Hunterbirding chat group on the 23rd Oct.
The concrete pavement at one of the fords on the road in (Gloucester Tops Rd) has collapsed (this problem has been in process for some time, and there has been a warning sign up at the ford for ages). The road is closed. Access to the Tops is possible but involves taking the Flood Detour  which you get to by heading 1.9km beyond the usual turn-off.  It is a very winding road over the tree-bare hilltops, with 5 gates to negotiate (all of them are on steep hills  you need a good handbrake!).  I saw just 4 species while traversing it i.e. it is a bleak, barren area to drive through.
The sign advising about the roadworks indicated that the road would be closed from 22 October to 9 November. If anyone goes to the Tops after that date, perhaps you can advise us about the status of it?

Maybe Alan can expand, but more likely your best bet is to call the parks office in Gloucester.

Mick

Hello Charles,

The land slip that required the Gloucester Tops road to be closed has been repaired.
The road is now suitable for any vehicle all the way to Gloucester Falls and to the
start of the Carey's Peak walking track.

Cheers,

Jim Smart
