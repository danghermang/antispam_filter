Subject:[child_lit] NY/NJ Child_lit folks
As more and more photos show up of the devastation in NY and NJ, I hope 
that all of you on child_lit are doing all right, more or less. And then 
there's the blizzard in WV. I hope you all have food, water, shelter, 
and can walk the dog without too much trouble. Wish I could help from up 
here. I know some Vermonters  who suffered through Irene are on their 
way down to help. Take care and stay safe.
