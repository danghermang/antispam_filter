Subject:[CT Birds] New Vulture Roost
10/26 - New Milford - new (to me) vulture roost - 50-60 assorted - light  
was too poor to do a decent count but mostly Turkey with a lot of Blacks in  
a tall leafless tree plus a couple of tall spruces at the top of Aspetuck  
Avenue off the top of the Green.  The birds flying around were all  Black 
Vultures.  Canterbury students beware!
