Jim,
Nope--stranded wire --"Duke" is sometimes known here as "BD"=A0 ("Brother D=
uke"), who, I think signs his "posts" that way, as he can not spell "Duke"-=

Ron=A0 Rich=20

Hi All,
Had a problem with a Seeburg DS today, that I have never seen before---
Would not trip off at record end, from the old style trip switch. Would not=
 trip=20
off if contacts on the switch were shorted. Soldering, was original (50 yea=
rs=20
old !),and "looked good". Wire was not broken inside plastic sleeve, at eit=
her=20
end, ground connection was tight. So, I jumped from the "hot side" of the s=
witch=20
to the cradle, and it tripped instantly ??=20

I then took my hot iron and touched the terminal--it "blew up".=A0 Wire was=
 still=20
wrapped fairly tight, but the terminal itself looked as if no solder had EV=
ER=20
been applied to it !=A0 "Clean as a whistle", brand new--. I attempted to=
=20
re-solder it, but it was like trying to get oil and water to mix--solder ju=
st=20
rolled off.=A0 I then removed the wire, and hit the terminal with a file, w=
hich=20
made the solder stick--re-wrapped the wire and re-soldered it---
Does anyone besides me think maybe, just maybe, this is "Duke's doings" ??=
=20
