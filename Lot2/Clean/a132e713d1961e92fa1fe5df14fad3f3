Subject:[child_lit] middle grade novels
Hi Kerry,
I like Circle of Doom by Tim Kennemore. It's a magic-or-not kind of story, family oriented.
Also this one:
1.	
45 + 47 Stella Street and everything that happened
by Honey, Elizabeth.
... 45 + 47 Stella Street and everything that happened / by Henni Octon ( and Elizabeth Honey) ...
Publisher, Date: Toronto : Annick Press, c1998.

It's set in Australia, and is a good neighborhood mystery.  More than 10 years old, but fun.
