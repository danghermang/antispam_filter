Subject:Re: [child_lit] porn spam
Agreeing with others: not a problem to hit the DELETE key for awhile as you folks cope with the priority issues. Take as long as you need. So glad to know you are safe.

Perhaps this would give you a welcome laugh? I marveled at how clever the spamers were becoming (using the subject line of a post I had sent to Child-lit recently meant I would open the email - and that the subject would not trigger a spam alert). I was so impressed with the sneakiness, I read the moderately offensive Spam (which listed the young woman's voluptuous body parts) to my husband. As I looked up, he commiserated by asking if I could forward the Spam to him so he could study it in more detail! haha ....er, no, my dear :-)

Quite a bit of central New Jersey is under-water and power is out throughout a fair part of the state. I know that some of you are receiving annoying and improper emails, for which I am dreadfully sorry, but as unwelcome as this is, it does not rise to the level of magnitude that will concern University personnel right at the moment. If someone would be kind enough to forward one of the emails to me, I will see what I can do to put a stop to them.
