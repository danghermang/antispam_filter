Sort of.

The GPU/Videocore is still a black box with lots of knobs, buttons, 
switches and levers with a binary blob of code to boot into it, but what 
they've opened up is the manual for those knobs, buttons, switches and 
levers that let you access the functions inside it.

So really not much different from plugging in any dedicated hardware into 
a PC - e.g. a SCSI RAID conroller card. You get the register descirptions 
and how they work in the hardware manual for that card so you can write a 
Linux device driver to control it, but you don't get the circuit diagram 
or any internal code that may run on any microcontrollers on that card.

So if one of those buttons is "matrix multiply", or "fft", or some other 
general purpose mathamatical function then it might be usable as a mini 
"supercomputer" type of thing, however given that its name is "videocore", 
I somehow doubt it.

It should allow people to write better/faster video drivers for it though.
