That was my understanding, too.  But the fragmentation of documents
and their popular support is caused by the fragmentation of tools.
Right?  It's here in your example:

So the documents (and popular support) cannot be defragmented without
defragmenting the tools.  There are two approaches to that that differ
in the up-front principles they enshrine:

  A. Simplification and standardization (then restricted choice)

  B. Equality and freedom of choice (then ad hoc inter-communication)
     http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-October/005114.html

We propose a mechanism for B.  We rig Metagov as a plug-in framework
with a neutral tool switch.
