You ought to know that capacitors can be explained perfectly without
the use of a notional current flowing between the plates.  Capacitors
have been used to illustrate the idea of displacement currents but I
believe it has not helped anyone's understanding of displacement
currents, indeed it has caused a lot of confusion.

The concept is necessary in explaining radio waves, but not capacitors.
