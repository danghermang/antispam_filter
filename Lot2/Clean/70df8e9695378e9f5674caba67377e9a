I don't even like my next door neighbour, but my road's better than the
next road, but both are better than the next-door area, though I prefer
to live this side of town. I moved here because it's better than the
next town, but anywhere this part of the country is better than the
north. Still, rather live in England than Scotland - they're only ok as
part of the GB Olympic team. Best country in Europe, but I always
support Europe in the Ryder Cup against the Americans. Having said that
I'm keener on the Nato countries than those from the East, but when the
aliens land we'll all be standing together...

Racist? Nah...

Harry
