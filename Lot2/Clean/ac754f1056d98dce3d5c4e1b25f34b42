Subject:SAC gear hours TODAY, 4:30
Alpinists,

For some of us, the season is coming to a close, for others, it's just beginning... whichever camp you're in, we've got the gear!  Come down to Cubberley 34 to SAC up.  As always, bring a check along for deposit.

AND PLEASE BRING BACK THE GEAR YOU HAVE CHECKED OUT!  We will need all the helmets, harnesses, biners and belay devices we can for this weekend's SAC trip.

Cheers,
Zach
