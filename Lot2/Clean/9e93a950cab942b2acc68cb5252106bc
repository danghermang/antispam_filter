Subject:3.2.0-0.bpo.3-686-pae [Firmware Warn]: GHES: Failed to read error
	status block address for hardware error source:
Hi,

I just installed 3.2.0-0.bpo.3-686-pae on two machines (PRIMERGY RX300 S6) and I
am seeing a lot of this in dmesg:

[12486.191403] [Firmware Warn]: GHES: Failed to read error status block address
for hardware error source: 45056.
[12486.191411] [Firmware Warn]: GHES: Failed to read error status block address
for hardware error source: 57344.
[12486.191416] [Firmware Warn]: GHES: Failed to read error status block address
for hardware error source: 4096.
[12546.099123] [Firmware Warn]: GHES: Failed to read error status block address
for hardware error source: 45056.
[12546.099128] [Firmware Warn]: GHES: Failed to read error status block address
for hardware error source: 57344.
[12546.099132] [Firmware Warn]: GHES: Failed to read error status block address
for hardware error source: 4096.

Adding ghes.disable=1 do the kernel boot options seems to have fixed this.

FWIW, I am seeing this

[   25.784242] qla2xxx [0000:06:00.1]-8038:6: Cable is unplugged...
[   25.784246] qla2xxx [0000:06:00.1]-803b:6: Firmware ready **** FAILED ****.

wrt firmware and errors in dmesg. The card in question is a dualport QLogic
Fibre Channed HBA, QLE2462 to be precise.

It seems to be working ok, I can see all my LVM pvs, vgs and lvs. The
second port is in fact unconnected.

HTH,

	Stefan
