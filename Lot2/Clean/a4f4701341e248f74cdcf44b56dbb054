Subject:[burners] Free Computer Towers
I have access to two DELL  computer towers for free!

They are completely blank with no OS but there is a valid serial key on
each desktop so you=92d just have to get the OS CD.

They come as is and do not include the monitor, keyboard or mouse.

Please message me no later than 3pm Friday the 9th if you want them. I'm
located down town so you can either come get them from me or I can bring
them to the Meet and Greet next week.

Tawny Love
