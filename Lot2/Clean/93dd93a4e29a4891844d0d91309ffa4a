Titles that come to mind: 

From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs Basil E Frankweiler by E.L. Konigsburg -- the
runaways are in the Met and examining a Michelangelo statue of an angel (may
or may not be a Michelangelo). 

A wordless Canadian picturebook in which a child travels through the
Vancouver Art Gallery into a series of iconic Canadian landscape paintings:

Subject: [child_lit] Children's books inspired by specific artefacts on
public display in museums (any where in the world)?

Dear all,

I'm working on a list of children's books inspired by specific artefacts on
public display in museums. With the much appreciated help of many colleagues
over on list similar to this one, but in the UK, I've drawn up quite a long
list of books (some more relevant than others), but I'd love to hear if
anyone has any more books they think could be added to the list.

Books which are really about/strongly inspired by a specific museum artefact
are the closest match for what I'm after, but books featuring real
museums/art galleries / homes open to the public / archaeological sites are
also of interest.

My list is quite long, and only slightly sorted:

*Books inspired by/referencing specific artefact(s) now viewable in a
museum*
*Roald Dahl's The Mildenhall Treasure

*Rosemary Sutcliff, The Eagle of the Ninth & The Silver Branch -- inspired
by a Roman eagle (not actually a legionary standard) in Silchester / Calleva
museum. See her note to the latter book.

*Robin Jarvis's Whitby Witches has ref to Hand of Glory in Whitby Museum and
1861 lifeboat disaster display at lifeboat museum

*Rosemary Sutcliff, illustrated by Ralph Thompson -- "Chess dream in a
garden" -- inspired by a dream Thompson had which featured the Lewis
chessmen from the British Museum.

*Francesca Simon's The Sleeping Army - also inspired by the Lewis chessmen

*Michael Morpurgo's Little Manfred - inspired by an object (I believe) in
the Imperial War Museum in London

*Ottoline at the British Museum (1987) by Sally Craddock (illus. Corinne
Pearlman) is a picture book recounting the adventures of a cat in the BM,
and features many real exhibits.

*Mary Ray, The Golden Bees -- features the original of these
http://www.thecaringsociety.com/products/Minoan-Bee-Earrings.html which are
to be seen  I've been led to believe in the Herakleion museum in Crete.

*Beatrix Potter - The tailor of Gloucester. The waistcoat in the story is in
the V & A. 
http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/b/beatrix-potter-tailor-of-gloucester/

*Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising references, at one point, the Sutton Hoo
ship, while the words "Liht mec heht gewyrcan" on the first of the Signs
which Will Stanton finds is a steal from the Alfred Jewel
http://britishstudies.pbworks.com/f/Alfre_jewel.jpg in the Ashmolean
("Aelfred mec heht gewyrcan" -- Alfred had me made).

*Malone, Marianne.  The Sixty-Eight Rooms.  New York: Random House, 2010.
*Malone, Marianne.  Stealing Magic.  New York: Random House, 2012. A sequel
to the above book.
*Malone, Marianne.  The Pirate's Coin.  To be published in May, 2013.  
Third in this series.
These books are set at Chicago's Art Institute in their Thorne Rooms,
miniature rooms, and has the children discover how to shrink down and enter
the rooms and travel back in time.  For information on the Thorne Rooms,
which are a must-see if you ever visit Chicago, see this page: 
http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/thorne

*Kerley, Barbara.  The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins: An Illuminating
History of Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins, Artist and Lecturer.  Illustrated by
Brian Selznick.  New York: Scholastic, 2001.  A wonderful picture-book about
the 19th-century museum dinosaurs that Hawkins built.

*The National Museum of Australia commissions a series of books called
'Tracks' written by established Australian writers -- each based on an
artefact in the museum.

acks

*Stoneheart by Charlie Fletcher opens at the Natural History Museum in
London. The artefact is a statue of a pterodactyl on the building itself
rather than anything inside it. It's a fabulous read!


*Clara Button and the Magical Hat Day by Amy de la Haye, Emily Sutton  - a
picture book about a family visiting the Victoria and Albert Museum, which
highlights several items in the V&A's public collection

*Philip Pullman's The Subtle Knife has a key scene set in the Pitt Rivers
museum with shrunken heads.

*Lost in the Toy Museum / Christmas at the Toy Museum by David Lucas - The
Museum of Childhood, London - lots of the toys in the museum are included in
this book, though I don't know how many are on public display

*The Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E Frankweiler by E.L Kongisburg - although
the statue and the bed are not on display, other artifacts mentioned in this
novel can still be seen in New York's Metropolitan Museum of  Art (see
http://www.metmuseum.org/learn/for-kids/family-guides/the-mixed-up-files-iss
ue)

*Books set in (or at least with scenes in) non-imaginary museums* (ie
museums you can actually go and visit for real, rather than simply in your
head. These books may make reference to specific artefacts, but I haven't
been able to double check that yet)



*Penelope Lively, The house in Norham Gardens -- anything in the Pitt-Rivers
Museum.

*The Story of the Amulet by E. Nesbit draws freely on the collections of the
British Museum.

*There is a chapter in Gillian Avery's 'The Elephant War', set in the 1870s,
that takes place in the Ashmolean Museum and describes some of the
artifacts, though that is not the main plot of the book.

*Selznick, Brian.  Wonderstruck.  New York: Scholastic, 2011.  Set in part
at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

*Rohmann, Eric.  Time Flies.  New York: Crown, 1994.  Some of this picture
book is set at Chicago's Field Museum.

*Red Pyramid by Rick Riordin - scene in the British Museum

*Robert Swindell's Blitzed - Eden Camp


*Books set in/referencing non-imaginary art galleries/specific art work* (as
opposed to museums) *'Dogs' Night' by Meredith Hooper, set in London's
National Gallery

*You can't take a balloon into the Metropolitan Museum by Jacqueline Preiss
Weitzman "In this wordless story, a young girl and her grandmother view
works inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, while the balloon she has been
forced to leave outside floats around New York City causing a series of
mishaps that mirror scenes in the museum's artworks."

*James Mayhew's Katie and the Sunflowers and Katie and the Mona Lisa, and
all the other Katie books in the series.

*Blue Baillet's Chasing Vermeer

   *Laurence Anholt's "Artists Series" -- all about real children who met
real artists painting real pictures: 
http://www.anholt.co.uk/anholts-artists - and click along using the arrows
at the foot of the page.

*Jan Pienkowski: Botticelli's Bed and Breakfast (1997)

*Anthony Browne: Willy's Pictures (2008). Browne often uses visually
intertextual reference to well-known images in his work.

*Tell Me A Picture by Quentin Blake.

*Gillian Avery's 'The Italian Spring' includes a lot about visits to the
picture galleries of Venice.

*Dan's Angels by Lauren Child and Alexander Sturgis

*Books set in house open to the public to visit* *A National Trust property,
Belton House in Lincolnshire, is the setting for Helen Cresswell's
'Moondial'.

*Lucy Boston's Green Knowe books are based on the real house, and many of
the items in the books are on display in the house, which is open to the
public

*'The Children of the House' by Phillipa Pearce is about the National Trust
property Charlecote House

*Books set in/around (what are nowadays) archaeological sites* *The
Rollright Stones (Penelope Lively, Whispering Knights)

*Mycenae's Lion Gates (Mary Ray, The Standing Lions)?

*The Children of the Stones, which was a book as well as a TV series in the
1970s, is set in and around Avebury ('Milbury'), and the museum curator is a
major character. The museum in question can still be visited. [Zoe add: my
understanding is that The Children of the Stones was a film first, and then
a book was made based on the TV show]

*Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbevilles


*Queries* - these are books people suggested although they weren't sure if
the artefact/museum/gallery in the book was based on a real one or not. If
anyone has further information on these, I'd love to hear it.

*Nancy Bond's A string in the harp
*Robert Swindell's Room 13
*Cynthia Voigt's 'The Vandemark Mummy'.
*Posy Simmonds' book Lulu and the Flying Babies is based on any particular
museum/gallery *Field, Rachel.  Hitty: Her First Hundred Years.  New York:
Macmillan, 1929.
