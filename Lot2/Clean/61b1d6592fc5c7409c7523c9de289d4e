Subject:Re: [Flexradio] MOX button and TX audio in 2.4.4 ?

If using the Voice Keyer with PSDR it would be nice to be able to override
VAC using the MOX button. I mentioned this to Ray K9DUR and he said he would
take a look at it.

Thanks to those who pointed out VAC - that was it.
All my TX profiles had VAC turned on for the benefit of my SSTV and 
digital programs.

It makes sense for it to work the way it does. You don't want mic audio
in the mix when using VAC. When I want do alternate between voice and 
SSTV I can use the foot pedal for the voice transmissions. When I want 
to use the MOX button I can disable VAC for that profile easily enough.
