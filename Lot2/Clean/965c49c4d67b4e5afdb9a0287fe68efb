Subject:[Jukebox-list] Rock-ola System S5 control
Trying to locate a copy of the schematic of a Rock-ola System S5 CPU (Black 
Faced CPU). So far I have been unable to locate a schematic or manual that 
covers the Control. Guess they are pretty scarce and have checked with the 
one supplier I thought might have one but to no avail. Also have a call into 
Rock-ola but not sure if that will pan out or not.

If anyone has a manual or a schematic can you please contact me off list.

Thanks in Advance
Steve/Florida
