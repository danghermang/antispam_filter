Subject:[CT Birds] when a storm is coming.
Boy - birds sure know when a storm is coming. 
I counted 167 Junco feeding in my yard, with that, if not
more from my neighbors yard.
Also 17 White-t-Sparrow under feeder, with many
more in yard and on lawn.
Fattening up before the big one comes.

Siskin down to 30 from 60.
