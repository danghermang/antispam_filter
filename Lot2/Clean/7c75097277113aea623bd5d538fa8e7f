Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] What bird #2
Hi Jude,
		There is no doubt it is a Little Shrike-thrush. The northern Queensland form is distinctly rufous as the image clearly shows (it's former name was Rufous Shrike-thrush).  As other posts also indicate, Bower's Shrike-thrush is confined to upland rainforest in the Wet Tropics.

best wishes,



Peter Valentine
