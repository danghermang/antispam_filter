It was more like '08-09, and it's languished in a half-finished state
due to stuff that went on in my personal life (sudden death of my wife,
etc).  I think I'd gotten all the sockets mounted on the board last time
I took a crack at it.  Also have an unassembled GIDE kit.

I may decide to get everything together and sell it to someone who has
the time to finish and play with it.  (Geoff R, I did get your email).

Also looking to sell my MacIvory II board set/docs/etc, as I bought it a
year and a half ago and haven't had time to do anything with it...
