Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Bertrand interview in the Times
While the barrow-boy element is bound to still exist, the creation of
academies and the requirement to provide education as well as the usual
media training for young lads has come much more to the fore, so it's
almost bound to be more likely in recent years.

I recall Ryan going to Bournemouth on loan with Jack Cork and the
reports came back that those 16 year olds were immaculate in their
learning and behaviour and were a real credit to the club. I doubt he's
in the barrow-boy category to be fair to him. A very level-headed lad
from what I've gathered.

regards
Harry
