Or include the following line -- and only the following line -- in a

    confirm e6912069dc60a173aa2724cfb18629f91db8e5e5

right form (additional "Re:" text in the Subject: is okay).

disregard this message.  If you think you are being maliciously
subscribed to the list, or have any other questions, send them to
