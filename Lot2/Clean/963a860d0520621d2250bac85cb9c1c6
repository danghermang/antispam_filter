Subject:Re: [Hsqldb-user] Cannot execute Hibernate query
The lastest problems are related to two separate issues

1. trunc(?) is normally resolved to numeric, instead of datetime. This
will be improved in version 2.3.0. Now you can use cast(? as date)
instead.

2. The Restriction.sqlRestriction() call is generating the timestamp in
a non-sql format (it has a 'T' instead of a space) therefore it won't
work.

Try to use sqlRestriction(String, Object[], Type[]) to use parameters
and rewrite the restriction as CAST. This example is SQL, which you need
to translate the parameter names to question mark paramaters and specify
the types in the arguments of sqlRestriction:

"cast(creation_datetime as date) between cast(fromDateTime as date) and
 cast(toDateTime as date)"

Please do not use this mailing list for development questions which need
follow-ups. You can use the Help forum for this type of question.
