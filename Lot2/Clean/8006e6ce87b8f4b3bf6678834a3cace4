Subject:Re: [bcp] [scu] The Ride of "Two" Carversville
Well I couldn't join you folks today for Carversville but I did ride "TWO" hundred kilometers. It was my first brevet with the PA Randonneurs. What a wonderful day we had for cycling! I saw lots of people riding all along the route.

For those of you who wanted to join me but couldn't, please check out the PA Randonneurs web page - http://users.rcn.com/trosenbauer/ They have another one coming up in a few weeks that is a bit flatter. I met some new great new cycling friends today and we enjoyed chatting over barbecue after the ride.

Here are my stats from today's ride, they are not complete because my Garmin was misbehaving (kept stopping the timer every time I walked across the river). Official time was 8:11 and I was first finisher for the 200k event!
