I think your best bet there is to get an antique machine that sews with a
chain stitch. I actually had a toy machine at one point that was a chain
stitch, but it would lose alignment easily.

Chain stitch, or tambour embroidery was popular in the 1780s. It's thought
to have originated in India. There is a beautiful Indian robe at the
Victoria & Albert Museum, from the early 18th century.
