Subject:[Jukebox-list] Moving Jukeboxes
Howdy,
  I'm going to have to move my juke pretty soon to replace it with the "new=
" one.  It's a rock ola 484.  So long and heavy unlike a pinball machine I'=
m used to moving.  I have an escolara.  My concern is strapping it to the h=
and truck but then it will stick out A LOT and be way off balanced.  I have=
 an option to buy a fork lift attachment from my work.  I think this might =
provide some more support.
  Is there any experience in this area out there?  Once outside I can regri=
p it from the bottom flat and move it but getting through the doors and sta=
irs is my worry.
Thanks
Ed
