Subject:[Antenna-discussion] Yagi vs. Log periodic
Hi folks:

In my neck of the woods there are some attempts to work 2 m=A0 SSB. Even th=
ough the 2m radio horizon is pretty well the line of sight plus, the QTH be=
ing on the northern shore of lake Ontario, the line of sight gets nicely DX=
y.

I've got a couple of home brewed Yagis to take care of the repeaters, they =
work well indeed,

but then I came across this log periodic antenna design and what intrigued =
me was the bandwidth. The Yagi is notoriously narrow band, so I was wonderi=
ng if anybody on this distinguished forum has any ideas and/or recommendati=
ons re the log periodic antenna.

From what understand how the log periodic works, it invokes the the element=
s=A0 that are close to the frequency in use and ignores the rest of the ele=
ments.

There must be a trade off between the bandwidth and the gain.

Any comments gents?
