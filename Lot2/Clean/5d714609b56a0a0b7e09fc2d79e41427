To Paul who lent me a pair of shoes, again thanks, at least once a year I
leave for a ride and forget my shoes, last night was my turn for 2012. How
lucky was I, right size, right cleats!

 

I have your cleat covers and will give them to you next Thursday. They were
on the roof of my car. J The only place I didn't look before you drove away.

Hey fellow Conshy riders!

We had a great turn-out for last night's ride due to the mild temps,
including a several riders new to the night time experience.

Next Wednesday is Halloween.  In order to avoid all the ghosts and goblins
on the SRT and be home for our trick-or-treaters (not to mention any
heightened activity in Manayunk), we are moving the ride to Thursday night.
Also a plus is that the remnants of Sandy should be gone by then.

Hope you can make it.

Steve Muth
