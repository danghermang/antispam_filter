And here for all these many years I have been working on them, I was always=
 under the impression that the manufactures installed too many parts, and t=
hat's why they would work "perfectly" even though there were some "left ove=

There is a major difference between doing routine lubrication and tearing
down a mech and starting over if you are restoring a machine. I would do
nothing until you have the proper manual documents, study it, and then
formulate your questions based on what you want your outcome to be. Tearing
down a jukebox into its intricate parts can be very dangerous, especially
if you have parts left over when you are finished, if you get my drift...
