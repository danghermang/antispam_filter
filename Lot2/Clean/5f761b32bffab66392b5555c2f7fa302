Subject:Re: [MG] Requirements in regard to split opinion formation
Hi Michael,

There is always time, when people doing the right things together ;o)

So you wrote

To be honest you don't need to be a member of our working group - even not
of Pirate Party - when you want to cooperate with us. It's all about coming
together and working on the right things.

>But first I have some questions.  Do you have time to answer?

Sure, you are welcome.

Sorry, I can't cite your ascii ;o)

Yes, that's what our working group tries to establish.

And even more, if the user starts with T1 and then recognizes that T2 fits 
better to his needs, than he can just switch over to T2, if T2 provides a 
migration path to the Common Business Entity Model (CBEM) ;o)

Here is a first draft of our idea of a Common Business Entity Model (where 
'Business' means it's not a 'Data' Entity Relationship Model assignable to a 
database schema, it's just objects found in the real world - the database 
schema might look totally different):
http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/4/45/DSFS-BusinessEntityModel.jpg

Unfortunately it's not fully translated yet, but I hope you understand our 
intention. The blue rectangles are objects that are part of the base 
framework standard. The red ones are specific to plug-ins, using the blue 
ones to inherit from, or just defining new ones.

At the end the blue ones are those who all tools should be able to convert 
their own Model into. That's the way the different tools can interchange 
their data.

Does this make sense?

Cheers
Marc
