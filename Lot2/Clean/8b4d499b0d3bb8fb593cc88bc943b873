Subject:Re: [EVDL] Ceramic Heater elements
I pulled out enough of the ducting so I could see the elements. =A0Fortunat=
ely, it was pretty easy to get this far. =A0Getting the element all the way=
 out would be a different story... =A0Anyway, here's a picture of them: =A0=
https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rLlqbd4dnlTnlxJPAgbHk9MTjNZETYmyPJy0l=
iipFm0?feat=3Ddirectlink=A0 hopefully that links correctly.

The one on the left of the photo is the one that is in use, the one on the =
right is never switched on (just too much power draw). =A0So, to recap righ=
t now at 158ish volts I'm pulling ~17a through one element. =A0I'm about to=
 raise my voltage to 183v nominal. =A0The elements are very nicely imbedded=
 in the heater core, it's actually a very nice install. =A0I'd LOVE it if I=
 could keep the heaters in there physically as they are. =A0

right now, each element is wired (+) (-) (+) (-) (+). =A0It is my understan=
ding that if I rewire it so each element is (+) (empty) (-) (empty) (+) it =
will split the four elements into two series pairs, and run them in paralle=
l. =A0This should reduce the current, and the heat output. =A0But if I wire=
 both elements up that way and have them on together, I'm hoping the heat o=
utput should be comparable to the single core running overloaded like I had=
 before.

Am I on the right track here?

thanks,
david.=A0
