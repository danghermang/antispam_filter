Alas, nothing right now, except a couple of my husband's suits to mend (he started a day job again this week.) I'm trying to write instead of sew, but that is slow going, too.

It's that time of year: holiday parties, winter balls, theater season,
company dinners, Dickens Fair, New Years Eve, cocktail parties,12th
Night. You might even be planning a sojourn to a balmy tropical
locale.  Whatever the reason, h-costumers are probably making (or
re-making) something.  So, what's your dressmaker's dummy wearing
today?

PS. It's ok to run into the sewing room, toss something marvelous on
the dummy and *then* tell us about it. It's also ok to tell what's on
your design sketchbook, worktable, at the sewing machine or even in
the
embroidery hoop.
