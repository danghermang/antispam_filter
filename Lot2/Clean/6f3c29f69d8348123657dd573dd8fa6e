As do I with two caveats:

1. Don't describe it as "unpaid fees," describe it as an "accrued
transfer fee for registrations not held under a registration services
agreement" or something similarly neutral. Negative words like
"unpaid" imply a penalty and this isn't supposed to be a penalty for
anyone.

2. Don't refuse to interact with a registrant on matters unrelated to
the legacy registration. Tell a legacy registrant he can't have IPv6
addresses unless he first signs over his IPv4 addresses and you make
that registrant's choice an easy one: no IPv6 this year.

Regards,
Bill Herrin
