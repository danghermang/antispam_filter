Subject:[kurtlist] SOI Japan Tour information

I received some information on SOI 2013 Japan Tour by TV Tokyo event
mailing-list.

Cast: K. Browning, I. Kulik, J. Buttle, E. Gordeeva, J. Rochette,
Shizuka Arakawa, Mao Asada, Daisuke Takahashi, Takahiko Kozuka and
"more top skaters from the world."

Love the cast! I think I can safely say these guys with Shawn makes
the best JSOI cast ever. Also this must the first time in a long time
Ilia and Katia come to Japan together.

I am not sure if anyone here is interested in the prices and all
otther than the cast, but just in case:
