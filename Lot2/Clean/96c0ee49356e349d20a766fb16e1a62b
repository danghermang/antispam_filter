Subject:[EVDL] Calb battery issue


Hey folks,

Well, I've got 1800 miles on my Jeep.  Most things are working fine, except I started
getting a low voltage warning on 1 cell under moderate acceleration.  If I start
to draw about 250 battery amps, I have one cell that drops to 2.4V (other cells stay
above 2.6V).  This causes my mini bms to fire a warning.  Previously, I only got
a low voltage warning when drawing close to 400 battery amps.

I know someone who says they'll test this battery for me.  I emailed Keegan at Calb
and he redirected me to a gentleman named Ted.  I'm bummed because it's probably gonna
take me a while to resolve this.  Meantime, my Jeep is down and the weather is beautiful.
I could bypass the "bad" battery, but that would make the other cells have to work harder
and my charger is an Elcon and not easy to re-program, but I could rely on the mini-bms
to shut things off.

I really want to be a proponent of electric cars - but this is making it hard.  Having
a long turn around on repairs is a major bummer.   Maybe I should have gotten spare batteries. 

Folks are asking me about my Jeep and I'm trying to save face.  I really hate to say that
I might have a battery issue.

Once I get the battery test results back (the person is gonna test one good battery
and my "bad" battery), I'll be able to have a better recommendation for/against Calb
(both the batteries and the support).

My batteries are 130 Ah and I limited the battery current to 400 amps.  I only drive
on the highway for about 5 minutes, otherwise, I do around town driving.  Battery
current tends to stay between 100-200 amps except on the freeway.
