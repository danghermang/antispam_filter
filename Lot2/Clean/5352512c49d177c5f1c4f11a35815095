ASHLEY COLE will be off to Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season
- says his mum!

Cole has failed to agree fresh Chelsea terms after being offered only a
one-year deal and PSG are set to win the race to sign him.

Manchester United have also been interested in the England defender, who
will be available on a FREE in the summer.

But the 31-year-old's mum, Sue Cole, has told Facebook pals: "Well looks
like his going somwhere better hear than the talk of man u. Not too far
on the Euro star x"

She also posted a link to a report that PSG boss Carlo Ancelotti had
already made contact.

Cole won the Double with the Italian at Chelsea in 2010 and has a strong
relationship with his former coach, who has a huge budget at his new
club.

PSG, bankrolled by Qatari owners, are in a position to offer Cole a
lucrative deal to leave the Premier League and end his career in France.

Harry
