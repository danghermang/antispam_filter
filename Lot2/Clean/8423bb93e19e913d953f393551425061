Sorry. I think there's a single reason why this discussion is somewhat
relevant here on the backports mailing lists: Debian Wheezy
installations will have many more EXT4 filesystems, whereas Squeeze
has EXT3 as default and a very common choice. The biggest
synchronization problems seem to only appear on EXT3. If newer
versions of Iceweasel have more problems, it might be nice to inform
the user that EXT3 does not play nice with fsync, and about the
possibility to turn synchronization off. That's all, bye!
