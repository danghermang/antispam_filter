Subject:[CT Birds] Milford Pt. Nelson's
Milford Point from 7-9 this morning.

Not much on the beaches, a few Greater Yellowlegs and a lone Snowy Egret 
between the spit.  LOTS of Nelson's sparrows in the spartina all over, 
but I hunkered down and had at least a dozen within 15' of me for the 
better part of 20 minutes.  Once the sun finally broke through it 
afforded some awesome light for pictures.

Also, one lone Osprey cruising over the marsh, Ruby-crowned Kinglets, 
Pine Siskens, and lots of Goldfinches just near the marsh platform.

Back to the Nelson's....it's amazing the visual difference between some 
of the birds.  Is this just individual variation, or perhaps different 
subspecies?
