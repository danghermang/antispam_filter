Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Twitchathon 2012
We made a hundred
In the backyard at last.
We=92d twitched and we=92d listened
And really worked hard.
 From Mt Riv to Nepean
And then back again.
Then up to Blue Gum
Where a burn off was on.
We=92d looked and we=92d listened
All the way to the Wang.
Though we missed some certs
We were still in the race
When we reached Megalong
We were looking for four,
And quickly found three
In one paddock before
We arrived at the Tea Rooms
With four minutes to spare
With just one bird lacking
It had to be there
But the White-winged Chough
Was nowhere in sight.
The Hawkesbury Pips
Were waiting to greet us
But we couldn=92t be civil
Before we rushed past
To check the back yard
For that fabulous bird
And there under fruit trees
Avoiding our tick
Our hundredth species
A complete Chough clique.
Laidback Lapwings would appreciate additional monetary support for the  =

Cowra Woodlands Project. That is where the proceeds from this weekends  =

Twitchathon will go.

Hi everyone

Being a VIctorian, I tend to ignore things outside the Garden State. For

I was approached recently about the possibility of Twitchathon teams  =

please:

TEAM NAME
TEAM MEMBERS
EVENT (8 hour, 24 hour, etc)
SPECIAL CONSTRAINTS (Human powered transport,100Km radius, etc)
TEAM OBJECTIVE (e.g. 200 species; to get to work on Monday)

Please feel free to post after the event, and good luck to all teams
participating, even if you are not doing it on the PROPER weekend of
November 17-18!
