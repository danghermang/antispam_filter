Subject:Re: [EVDL] How do I drive my EV?
Last night I did my usual "long" loop with my van, keeping it in 2nd and so=
metimes 3rd when above 40 mph.=A0
I don't have an insulated battery pack, and as you know, if =A0you are on t=
he east coast, we got hit with some cold temps last night. I know that cold=
 affects the batteries, but withouth too many miles on the van, it's all ne=
w to me and hard to tell exactly how much the cold was part of the equation=
.=A0
My older batteries were really sagging by the time I was almost home, and m=
y new batteries were doing ok.=A0
I never had the motor above 4000 rpms (40mph in 2nd), but I did notice when=
 watching my voltmeters, that my saggs didn't recover like they did when I =
was going into the 5000+ rpms (keep in mind that I don't have a tach yet an=
d my RPMs are based on tire size, gear ratios and mph- in other words, I co=
uld be off on my calculations).=A0
Before, when I was staying in 1st so long, I would watch the older batterie=
s sag and then, as my rpms got really high -around 5000 I guess- the batter=
ies would stop sagging and start recovering while I still had my foot on th=
e accelerator. =A0I didn't see that happening last night. So am I looking a=
t a trade off- batteries or motor, pick one?=A0
It sure seems like the motor and batteries *liked* the high rpms.=A0
For those of you curious, here are the links I used to figure out my motor =
RPMs:
VW tranny info: =A0http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Transaxle.html
Online RPM calculator:http://www.csgnetwork.com/multirpmcalc.html=A0(I used=
 the calculator at the bottom of the page)
My tire height is 25.5 inches.
Thanks for all the input.
