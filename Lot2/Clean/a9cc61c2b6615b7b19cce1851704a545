Subject:[CT Birds] Flock of 9 Black Vultures in New Milford
This morning at around 9:15 am, I spotted a flock of 9 Black Vultures adjacent to the Starbuck's parking lot in New Milford.  After checking my field guide, I saw that these birds are not typically spotted this far north.  

Could it be a possible early reaction to the impending hurricane?
