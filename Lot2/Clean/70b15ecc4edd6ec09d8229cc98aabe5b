UPDATE:  Vern's son, Jason, just called me.  He assured me that he is
working diligently to catch up on all of the orders that he has received.
He promised to send my order out today, and he is working on catching up
on all of the other orders that have come in during the past month.  He
was very nice and thanked me for my patience.  If there are others on the
list that have pending orders, Jason is working hard to get them out.
