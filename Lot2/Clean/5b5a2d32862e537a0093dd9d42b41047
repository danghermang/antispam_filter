Subject:[h-cost] Husqvarna Software and Machines
Just to put in the .02 again! I have owned my machines SE and Designer
Diamond and now DDD the Deluxe, for 16 years, I think all total.  I work
currently with 5D but I have used 4D and 3D, I consider 5D to be a breeze
in making all sorts of designs, and I do think taking classes is always the
best route, I am lucky I have a wonderful person who is a dealer, and she
adores digitizing and so I am able to bring pieces I want to do and then we
work with them.

I make all sorts of things my Persona is 16th Century, so it has been
difficult to find Blackwork or geometric designs that mimic this period.
and I have been able to achieve them.


Bad part? People checking out my blackwork, which I created set up and then
stitched out via my Machine and having them tell me I could have done it by
hand.  So I can do an entire Shift in under an Hour, and I will not be in
splints for the next 4 weeks with pain meds...I do this by machine because
I need to, but I digress.

I have not had an issue digitizing designs I did have issues with getting
to know how to Digitize.  That is a learning curve but well worth it,
everytime I make someone's badge or I make emblems of office people are
very, very happy that I have this machine.  I am doing some grape leaves
for a project for my Barony.

Again though? I suggest you play with all machines, as I said I am in love
with my Babylock Serger, It is fast and efficient and I am to take my
second class on Friday and I can't wait!! LOL Plus there are
sewing. Digitizing and Serger Clubs, to help you get better and meet others
who share your passion.
