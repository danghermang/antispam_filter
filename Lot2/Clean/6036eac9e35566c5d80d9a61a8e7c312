Yes the radiation resistance increases by 25^2. As for the inductance, this increases by about the same amount, and I give accurate equations in my article 'The Inductance of Ferrite Rod Antennas', antennex, July 2011. 
On reflection there is clearly a close relationship between the gain of the ferrite to an EM wave and the increase in inductance, and it is on my to-do list, when I get some time.
