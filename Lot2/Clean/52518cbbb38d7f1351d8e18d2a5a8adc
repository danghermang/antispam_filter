Subject:linux-image-3.2.0-0.bpo.4-686-pae
Hello.  I just upgraded to linux-image-3.2.0-0.bpo.4-686-pae on a system
and running "uname -a" I no longer see the date of the kernel.  The only
two packages that were updated are linux-image-2.6-686 and
linux-image-686-pae.

Before the upgrade:

storesvr:~# uname -a
Linux storesvr 3.2.0-0.bpo.3-686-pae #1 SMP Thu Aug 23 08:21:41 UTC 2012
i686 GNU/Linux

After the upgrade:

storesvr:~# uname -a
Linux storesvr 3.2.0-0.bpo.4-686-pae #1 SMP Debian 3.2.32-1~bpo60+1 i686
GNU/Linux

Is this a bug, or is this the way newer kernels are going?  I have some
scripts that are failing now because they check for that date.  Thanks
for any info!

Jase
