Subject:[EVDL] Power Consumption Question
I have been driving with my LiFePo4 pack for almost 11 months now, and
there seems to me to be an apparent difference in the number of Amp hours
that the same route to and from work uses with a fully charged and less
than fully charged pack. Now I realize that I need to be able to add in
temperature compensation to really get an answer, but here is an example of
the difference at relatively close temps: Today, with fully charged pack,
it took an average of 2.23 Ah to drive from home to work and back.
Thursday, with a pack that was at 45-50% capacity it took an average of
2.65 Ah.I am using the mini-BMS with the monitoring.  I haven't been really
looking at it lately, but I noticed it today because I had taken the
readings on Thursday, and could tell as soon as I got home that the numbers
today were lower, and I had noticed that it seemed like the drain was
faster as the pack capacity diminished.
Is there a recognized principle here that anyone knows, or am I seeing
things that aren't there?
Thanks!
