Subject:[CT Birds] Griswold Point in memoriam
I just received some images of Griswold Point post Sandy. The eastern basal section is no more. In 1993 the robust barrier bar was breached by a nor'easter. That breach was so narrow and shallow it could be crossed in two comfortable strides. The breach grew with each storm and eventually, over the years,  the barrier eroded dramatically and was ever changing. With Sandy however, the erosion has equaled deletion. It will be interesting to see how the now exposed organic mat of the Great Island Marsh is effected by a greatly increased exposure to surf. Interesting but likely distressing.
