Thank you, I'd like that. :-)  I've been hopeful ever since I listened
to the transcript of the first meeting, especially where Oliver
describes the group and it's raison d'=EAtre.

I have some questions about the model.  To keep them separate from my
other questions, I opened this thread.

(a) Why is discussion itself not modeled?  It's crucial of course, but
I don't see it anywhere.

(b) Why is a vote included as an actual (real world) entity?  Myself,
I think of voting as a formality of the system, something new we
introduce.  It does have *correlates* in the real world, but people
don't actually go about casting votes in order to form their opinions,
not yet.  (In fact, most of the right side seems to be modeling a
artificial system yet to be deployed, not the real world.  I probably
mistook your meaning for "business entity".)

Looking at the left side, I see a few possible errors:

(c) An opinion is not really (in itself) a document.  A document can
be involved in the formalization and expression of an opinion, but the
opinion is not bound to that form.

(d) Likewise, a point of view is not an opinion (at least not in
English).  It is one's outlook from a personal situation.  It may
influence opinion in peculiar ways, but is not an opinion in itself.

(e) Group membership is not a closed composite relation, but rather an
open aggregate.  One can be a member of many groups.

Although I don't have a full understanding yet, I suspect it will be
difficult to find the right model to code by.  It may take a while.
Later (in the other thread), I'll try to suggest a way of buying time
and (possibly) evolving some of the models by discovery.
