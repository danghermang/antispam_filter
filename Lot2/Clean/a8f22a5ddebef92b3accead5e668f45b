Subject:[LUG] mint update problems
My laptop is mint based and is complaining it cant update.
If I go into preferences in the update utility no matter what 
suppository I point to I get 403 denied. If I let it it chooses froonix 
in germany and then goes access denied.
Any clues as to what's going on?
