I will freely confess to having called Malouda a useless French C*nt many times

In much the same way I used to call SWP a useless midget c*nt

So you've never used a geographical descriptor in berating someone either..."Welsh twat", "Irish whatever"?

Racism is not the sole preserve of skin pigmentation.

I made it to the end and I'd like to disagree with one statement: "in times of stress and tension it will come out of even the best of us, however well intentioned we may be when calm and rational".

I can honestly, hand on heart, say that I have *never* called anyone a black anything and I would never dream of doing so.

The fact that JT used that phrase towards AF doesn't necessarily make him a racist.

It does, however, definitely make him an idiot.

Personally I'd rather not have someone who naturally uses that kind of language as the captain of my club, no matter how good a player he is.

If you think that makes me a prude, I don't care.   I just think a
captain
should be setting a much better example.

Finally, if Clattenburg really did use any kind of racist language on Sunday then he's an equally big idiot.
