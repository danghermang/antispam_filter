Subject:Re: [Chelsea] If Chelsea have slandered Mark Clattenburg as a
	racist, the club should be relegated immediately [Telegraph Blog]
No idea who Dan Hodges is, but he is here a prime example of those who appeal to ignorance and prejudice.  
He angrily stampedes to his conclusion that Chelsea be punished without once addressing what is so clearly a basic question -- what should the club have done once a player claims racial abuse?
So this blog post goes in the garbage, as do those on the other end of the spectrum that state the fix is in to clear Clattenburg without the slightest evidence.
