Subject:Re: [arin-ppml] REVISED: Draft Policy ARIN-2012-8: Aligning 8.2 and
	8.3 Transfer Policy
My point in proposing this is not to exclude resuming operations (which I would consider within the spirit of the language I proposed), but to exclude acquiring assets that used to use resources as an adjunct to acquiring the resources with no intent of continuing said operations using the resources.

IOW, I want to avoid extending the more lenient 8.2 provisions to a sale where someone buys $100,000 worth of IP addresses and $20,000 worth of hardware and then sells the hardware to $SCRAP_DEALER just to keep the addresses.

Those kinds of purchases belong under the scrutiny of 8.3.
