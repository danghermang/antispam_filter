Subject:Re: [Flexradio] 5000A for sale
I thought I would mention as many of us have Flex 5000's for sale.

There is nothing wrong with them, we just want to move some cash around so
we can buy the latest and greatest.

I had several email me about mine asking that question.

p.s.  Mine is still for sale as well :)
