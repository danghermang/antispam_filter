Subject: [meteorite-list] Fwd: First Alabama stone found!


Hi List,

   ( Marc Fries was kind enough to host/post this to the list for me  
since I can't send photos thru the List) Please see the exciting news  
below, as well as a couple of photos of the stone.

   *************************************************************

   I am happy to have the pleasure of being able to announce that the  
first stone from the new Alabama fall last Tuesday, Oct 30th has been  
found!

   A big CONGRATS to the team members Stephen Beck, Tommy Brown and  
Jerry Hinkle on their beautiful find late yesterday evening (11-3-12),  
almost exactly 4 days to the hour from the time of the fall. Great  
job, guys!

   No exact weight available yet, but best guess is near 60grams.  
Appears to be an OC, possibly brecciated. This particular specimen has  
a prominent metal vein on one corner.

   Also a big THANK YOU to Marc Fries, Jeff Fries, Rob Matson, and  
Jake Schaefer for their fantastic work with the radar! Most List  
members probably know that Jerry and I have been meteorite-hunting  
partners for over 20 years now. We had just subscribed to Galactic  
Analytics on Friday, 11-2. I had to work this weekend and couldn't  
join him (my wife said I should have asked someone to work for me- she  
was right... again ;-) on this hunt, but Jerry headed to Alabama Sat.  
morning with the maps, and by the end of the day, a meteorite was in  
hand! Now if that isn't a great testimony to the value of the GA radar  
map service, I don't know what would be. Great job by you guys, too!

   Now for a little back ground on the other members of the team and  
the story of how these guys got together to find a "find-of-a-lifetime".

   Stephen Beck is a good friend of mine who has several very  
interesting hobbies and a very successful practice, but meteorite  
hunting is something he had never actually got to do. Ironically, I  
had told him less than two weeks ago that the next time I went on a  
hunt I would definitely invite him. How were we to know that it would  
only be a few days before HE would be contacting me about his local  
news station there in AL describing a tremendous fireball that  
evening, complete with sonic booms. Not 5 minutes later, another  
friend sent me an email saying that Mike (Farmer) had just called him  
from Germany saying he had just learned of the fall and that there  
were almost certainly stones on the ground there. I told Jerry about  
it and since he's living the good life now and had plenty of time to  
go, he started making plans to go Sat morning. We arranged for him to  
meet up with Stephen and his
friend, Tommy Brown, who knew the area well. When they found the  
stone, they sent me a photo and I forwarded it to Mike. No doubt about  
it!

(see the photos of the stone that Marc is hosting for us)


   Best wishes,
   Robert Woolard

Howdy, all - Marc Fries writing now...

I have started up a gallery of meteorite photos on the Galactic  
Analytics web page!  I want to fill this gallery with pictures of  
meteorites that we help you recover. I need to figure out how to add  
labels with the meteorites' names and the names of the finder/owner,  
but here it is in a simple state for now.  This page will remain open  
to the public and will not need a subscription to view.

Pictures are available here:

Congratulations to Stephen Beck, Tommy Brown, Jerry Hinkle, and Robert  
Woolard for making the FIRST find of this fall!  We are calling this  
meteorite Add001 for now, but we may change the name (but not the  
number!) if the name submitted to the Nomenclature Committee is  
different from "Addison".

Congratulations again!
Marc Fries, Rob Matson, Jake Schaefer and Jeff Fries
