Ricky Sbragia congratulates Islam Feruz on his hat-trick against Switzerland

ISLAM Feruz should be well used to being referred to as the next big
thing. The Somalian-born naturalised Scot has been singled out as a
star in the making since his days coming through the Celtic youth
ranks. Now at Chelsea, he is thriving amongst the multi-million-pound
talent and Ricky Sbragia, the stand-in Scotland under-21 coach,
believes the player has everything needed to succeed at the top of the
game.

But dealing with such expectations is not always easy. Like many in
his age group there have been fears that Feruz wasn=92t mentally strong
enough or mature enough to keep himself grounded. Aged 16, he became
the youngest ever player to be capped for Scotland under-21s but just
weeks later he tweeted about his desire to play in the African Nations
Cup and his eligibility to do so with two countries. That was deemed a
slap in the face to the Scottish set-up which has nurtured him and had
pursued a FIFA rule change to allow youngsters with five years of
education in a country to represent that nation.

But Feruz is already travelling the road to redemption. Last month he
netted a hat-trick as Scotland under-19s defeated Switzerland to win
their European Championship qualifying group. It led SFA performance
director Mark Wotte to hail him as the =93next Scotland goalscorer=94 and
this week he has again been elevated to the under-21 squad for
Wednesday=92s away friendly against Portugal.

Wotte had qualified his praise of the lad who travelled to Scotland in
2001 with his family seeking asylum. He said that much would depend on
the right mindset and guidance. Sbragia, who earned a reputation for
spotting and nurturing quality youngsters during his time as
Manchester United=92s reserve team coach, believes Feruz has both
sorted.

Admitting he hadn=92t even heard of Feruz until he joined the SFA
coaching set-up, he said the signs were positive. Having overcome the
social media mishaps after his club, Chelsea, applied pressure on
Feruz to close his Twitter account, Sbragia has also been impressed.

=93I think he has grown up. We have had a lot of communications with him
and, obviously, with [academy coaches] Neil Bath and Jim Fraser at
Chelsea. They have been really pleased with him. He is a young player
in a big city and these things happen but I think he has knuckled down
and he looked a lot fitter on Sunday [playing for Chelsea youths] when
I saw him and he scored with his first chance. His work ethic was good
and everything about him was good. He looked very relaxed and maybe he
is on the pitch =96 he=92s far more comfortable and relaxed. He is very
private and he has stopped tweeting but that=92s not down to me!=94

With the need for a conveyor belt of talent through the Scotland
ranks, Feruz would seem to be the target man many are pinning their
hopes on and Sbragia believes it is with just cause.

=93But time will tell,=94 he says. =93He is with a fantastic club and the
people who oversee him, they are good people and they play the game
right. I have seen them and they are exceptional at Chelsea,
absolutely exceptional.=94

Sbragia concedes that he did not utilise the teenager effectively when
he had him at under-17 level but moving on to the under-19s, he says
that situation has been resolved and Feruz has rewarded them with some
massive performances since.

=93We were asking him to come a little bit shorter so we could play off
him but for him it=92s down the sides or over the top. He has
exceptional pace and great intelligence on positional sense so I got
that completely wrong. That was my first year at 17s and I didn=92t use
him at his best and we suffered because of that but he has got an eye
for scoring goals and you can=92t take that away from him and his work
rate was phenomenal when I saw him for Chelsea last Sunday.=94
