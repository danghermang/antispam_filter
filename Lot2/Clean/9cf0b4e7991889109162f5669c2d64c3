Alan,

"There is an obvious answer, which is that a loop antenna for a crystal
set needs to be so large that the ferrite requirement is far too
heavy."

I don't buy this.

The ferrite increase the inductance of the loop -- which is its desired 
property.

Since the inductance of a loop without ferrite is already just fine for the 
crystal set, you could get the same inductance with a smaller loop + 
ferrite.    The ferrite then would be rather light weight.

Indeed, some contemporary crystal radios use ferrites:

--------------------------------------
This brings up a related question.

Since in crystal radios the occasional use of ferrites is to shrink the size 
of the antenna, why wasn't this trick played with transistor radios (where 
compactness was a goal)?

There is an obvious answer, which is that a loop antenna for a crystal
set needs to be so large that the ferrite requirement is far too
heavy.

I know you are averse to details, but a tuned 1-metre square loop at 1
MHz can be shown to give an rf output power of -56 dBm, in other words
2.5 microwatts, at the edge of coverage of a typical AM station, which
is probably all right to operate headphones.  It didn't take long to
do the calculation - about 10 minutes.

You can expect a normal ferrite rod antenna to give 30-40 dB less, and
a ferrite rod antenna with the ferrite removed, leaving just the coil,
to give a further 20 dB less.  It's quite simple physics, but perhaps
not the sort done by modern physicists any more :).
