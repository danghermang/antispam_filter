Subject:Re: [LUG] Linux - and security
Some excellent advice and tips there.

Enhanced security always comes at the expense of convenience. It would 
be more convenient not to bother locking your front door when you leave 
in the hope that only you want to get in, because you can walk in 
without getting your key out, but so can everyone else.  So too for 
firewalls, intrusion detection, AV, etc.  Multi-level security is better 
(gateway and each workstation) but less convenient again and arguably 
not necessary in a home environment.  But some might argue window locks 
and a burglar alarm aren't necessary on a house.  It comes down to 
personal preference and how secure you want to feel vs how complex you 
make it to get in yourself.
