Dale,
Usually, unless someone has "messed" with it, adjustment will not fix this =
problem, as it is caused by "dirt", (or "rust"). In cases where the latch b=
ar fails to hold, I remove the keyboard from the phono, remove the solenoid=
, and wash the whole thing in hot soapy (ammonia) water. Rinse it, in hot w=
ater, dry it, and oil all moving parts with 20 wt. ND oil (except for the s=
olenoid itself--which should be left dry). A very LIGHT coat of "graphite g=
rease" might be needed on the latch bars them selves---then check operation=
, and make any needed adjustments.=A0=20

I have managed to rob and alter another hammer coil to get that problem res=
olved , now I'm having one more issue on this Rockola 408, it is locking th=
e number buttons but won't lock down the letter buttons. The lockbar soleno=
id is energizing but it won't lock the letters. If I push the numbers first=
 then hold the letter button down for a few seconds , it will make the sele=
ction but that is the only way. I can't see much of a adjustment on the loc=
king bar but I'm sure that must be the answer , unless something is just to=
o worn.=A0 Thanks all Dale
