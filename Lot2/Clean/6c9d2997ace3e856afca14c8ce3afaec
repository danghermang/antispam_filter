Subject:[Flexradio] BandTextEditor v1.0.0 Released
A new utility, BandTextEditor.exe, has been released & is available for
download from my website.

This utility will allow you to safely edit the PowerSDR BandText table.  The
BandText table contains all of the labels that are displayed below the VFO
frequency in PowerSDR.  By editing the BandText table you can add new labels
or change existing labels for any frequency or range of frequencies.

The BandText Editor only works with versions of PowerSDR which use a .xml
file for the database (v1.18.1 or later).  It will NOT work with the earlier
versions that used a Microsoft Access database file.

As with any utility that can modify the database, it is STRONGLY recommended
that you make a back-up copy of your database BEFORE using the program.
