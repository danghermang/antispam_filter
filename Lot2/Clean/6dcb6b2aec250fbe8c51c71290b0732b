Subject:Re: [burners] Question about mechanics
I <3 Metric Systems in Cambridge. Not the cheapest, but always honest. They
acquired the mechanics and customers of my previous mechanic when they
closed 10 years ago, and I'm happy with them.
I don't currently have a car, since mine was stolen about a year ago, but
when I get one again Metric Systems will check it out.
