Subject:[child_lit] OT,
	but you're the smartest group I know. Possibly meaning of Waterloo
So, just putting a postcard from Waterloo, Belgium on my daughter's desk and I know the Flemish pronounce it Water-low.  It just hit me, that being pronounced that way makes it the Flemish word for water (um, water) and the French word for water (l'eau).  

I do not know exactly what was being spoken in that part of Belgium in 1815 (was it even Belgium?  I should know this) and I'm wondering if that's where the name came from.  

O' wise and wonderful (and really international) list, any ideas?

Okay, back to getting my house ready for Thanksgiving (it's WAY too early, which is why I'm missing NCTE this year) and I'll stop being distracted by shiny squirrels.

ttfn,

Sharon
