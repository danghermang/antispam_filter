I normally run an AV as I get a lot of mail and so get a lot of win 
viruses that are passing around. At least I know not to forward those 
ones on and make things worse for the lcc (lower computer classes). On 
the odd occasion I take a look in the quarantine and check out a virus 
or too.
All I can say is there is some advantage to not teaching computing as 
thoroughly as they could.
