I just found this through Google, from
http://unixronin.dreamwidth.org/tag/psa :

"If you run a Mailman-based mailing list, and don't want Answerpot 
leeching
your list, here's how you slam the door on their sockpuppets:  Simply 
go to
each affected list's management page, go to the Privacy screen, and 
enter ^@
zeusmail.org into the banned-addresses list.  This is a wildcard 
regular
