That saying: "Kirchhoff's circuit laws apply only to static circuits"
can be extended to antennas with the proviso that the law must be
applied within a region in which electrostatics applies, that is,
provided the wire junction and the region in which the currents are
measured are small compared to the wavelength.

Therefore we can say Kirchhoff's law applies at junction of wires of
lambda/100 in diameter, but not necessarily when the wires are
lambda/10 in diameter.

So at 14 MHz for example Kirchhoff's laws will be all right for wires
of one inch diameter or less, and maybe more.  The assumption is that
the current behaves as though it flows in a filament along the axis of
the wire, which it might not when the wire is thick and there is
possibility of currents flowing laterally.

I never found that imagining displacement currents flowing through the
air to 'complete the circuit' was any use in antenna analysis, though
I first saw the argument 30-40 years ago :).  How come it's useful? I
think we need to be aware all the time that electric current and
displacement current are physically not the same thing at all and any
attempt to conflate them is liable only to confuse (Kirchhoff of
course says nothing about displacement currents).
