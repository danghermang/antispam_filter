Subject:Re: [EVDL] public charging station incentives?
Hi Mark, 

this is not the first time you inquired about charging in Davenport:
http://electric-vehicle-discussion-list.413529.n4.nabble.com/public-charging-stations-tp4212688p4212886.html

I am glad your host is more warm to the idea of using the EVSE
incentives.
While you are interested in Davenport, I however am all to aware of the
huge gap in public EVSE along Hwy 1 between Santa Cruz and Daly City. 

I would like to see public EVSE installed in Half Moon Bay: I found a
quieter portion of a major shopping center parking lot near both Hwy 1
and Hwy 92

But that is San Mateo county, and Davenport is in Santa Cruz county
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davenport,_California

Getting back to your post's inquiry of what are the public EVSE
incentives, I can give two two things: 
I suggest you determine how much EVSE to install (meaning, how much the
host is willing to spend both for the initial install and for the
monthly EVSE networking fees), and I can give some contacts to begin
with. 

Of all the incentives I have read about, after the incentives were paid
out, the host still had some up front costs, and the host had to pay the
monthly EVSE networking fees. So, there is no free-lunch here.

If the Davenport EVSE was only used by you, and set to charge a
$0.20pkWhr fee, no matter if you charged at level-1 or level2 it would
cover their electricity cost, plus a little extra for the host. But if
the EVSE is not used much it might be a losing deal because of the
monthly EVSE networking costs (the EVSE company charges a fee for
allowing monitoring of the EVSE, and any use transaction fees, via their
wireless network.).

If the host decided to install a non-networked EVSE (i.e. ClipperCreek),
the only costs would be the initial install (no networking fees
thereafter). ClipperCreek does have an add on logging and networking
package, but most of the retrofit installs (old Avcon EVSE yanked and
replaced with their j1772) were simple and easy to use non-networked
j1772 EVSE. For those that do not know, the ClipperCreek case is almost
the same as the old evii Avcon enclosure, it is really, really strong,
weather-proof (even in salt spray areas), and pretty-much vandal-proof
(the cable and coupler are not)
http://www.clippercreek.com/products.html

Note: if after you make contact with the source I'll mention next, your
host decides it wants to bypass a j1772 and go even cheaper, a much
lower cost EVSE solution is to install a 6-20 outlet in a weather tight
enclosure out in the parking lot located where ice do not like to park:

http://brucedp11.150m.com/evse11/ev-charging-level1-outdoor-ca-pa-creekside-inn-20110422-004-m.jpg
The first link is for a 6-20 straight blade duplex receptacle (each
outlet would be connected to its own 20A 240VAC breaker). I do not
recommend an outside 5-20 outlet as so many of these are used by RV
squatters/urchins.


If your host is interested in knowing the ins and outs of a j1772
installation, then I suggest you make contact with Will Beckett of 
http://eaacc.org/ (use the webmaster link at the bottom) and ask him for
the direct contact for who you should work with for Santa Cruz county.
He will likely be able to hook you up with the http://www.ambag.org/
person Will sees at AMBAG meetings.
That person would know the Santa County contact for just such a public
EVSE install.
