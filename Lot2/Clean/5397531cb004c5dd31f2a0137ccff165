Subject:Re: [EVDL] EVLN: Don't 'Jaws of Life' the orange cables
Sure, but the standard is a bit bogus.  Those orange cables have barely a
mm of insulation.  Crumpling metal edges will easily penetrate it.  So who
cares whether it is orange or blue? It is a failure waiting to happen.  Put
in underground conduit (you know the stuff I am talking about right?), and
it is impervious to pretty much anything.  Color the conduit if you want,
but there is no comparison between "bare" cable and conduit.
