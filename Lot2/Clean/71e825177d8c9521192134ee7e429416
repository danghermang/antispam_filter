Subject:Re: [Flexradio] BandTextEditor v1.0.0 Released
Ray,

Very nicely done! When executing BandTextEditor version 1.01 for the 
first time it prompted me to update to Microsoft NET Framework 4.0.3 
(that was long overdue on my WinXP station computer) and once that was 
done it has run flawlessly. The interface allowed me to customize every 
band for my operating uses in less than 10 minutes! Great job!

73,

Rob W1AEX
