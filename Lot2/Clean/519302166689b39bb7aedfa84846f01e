W3C Workshop: Web Performance

   28 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9578

   W3C announced today a Workshop on Web Performance, 8 November,
   hosted by Google at their Mountain View, California campus. As
   the Open Web Platform expands, the need for high performance
   implementation has grown, particularly on mobile devices.
   Participants will examine a broad range of performance issues
   and how they might be addressed. There is no fee to participate
   in this Workshop and W3C Membership is not required. All
   participants are required to submit a statement of interest by
   29 October. Learn more about W3C's Web Performance Working
   Group, which also invites people to share performance issues
   via their survey on Open Web Platform Performance Priorities.

Media Fragments URI 1.0 (basic) is a W3C Recommendation

   27 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9577

   The Media Fragments Working Group has published a W3C
   Recommendation of "Media Fragments URI 1.0 (basic)." This
   document describes the Media Fragments 1.0 (basic)
   specification. It specifies the syntax for constructing media
   fragment URIs and explains how to handle them when used over
   the HTTP protocol. The syntax is based on the specification of
   particular name-value pairs that can be used in URI fragment
   and URI query requests to restrict a media resource to a
   certain fragment. Learn more about the Video in the Web
   Activity.

RDB to RDF Mapping Language (R2RML) and A Direct Mapping of
Relational Data to RDF are W3C Recommendations

   27 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9576

   The RDB2RDF Working Group has published two W3C Recommendations
   today:

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/rdb2rdf/
     * R2RML: RDB to RDF Mapping Language. This document describes
       R2RML, a language for expressing customized mappings from
       relational databases to RDF datasets. Such mappings provide
       the ability to view existing relational data in the RDF
       data model, expressed in a structure and target vocabulary
       of the mapping author's choice. R2RML mappings are
       themselves RDF graphs and written down in Turtle syntax.
       R2RML enables different types of mapping implementations.
       Processors could, for example, offer a virtual SPARQL
       endpoint over the mapped relational data, or generate RDF
       dumps, or offer a Linked Data interface.
     * A Direct Mapping of Relational Data to RDF. This document
       defines a direct mapping from relational data to RDF.

Call for Review: Packaged Web Apps (Widgets) - Packaging and XML
Configuration (Second Edition) Proposed Edited Recommendation
Published

   27 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9575

   The Web Applications Working Group has published a Proposed
   Edited Recommendation of "Packaged Web Apps (Widgets) -
   Packaging and XML Configuration (Second Edition)." This
   specification updates the Widget Packaging and XML
   Configuration, and addresses some errata found in the original
   recommendation. It also updates the name of the specification,
   to be more in vogue with industry trends towards the naming of
   this class of application. This specification standardizes a
   packaging format and metadata for a class of software known
   commonly as packaged apps or widgets. Unlike traditional user
   interface widgets (e.g., buttons, input boxes, toolbars, etc.),
   widgets as specified in this document are full-fledged
   client-side applications that are authored using technologies
   such as HTML and then packaged for distribution. Comments are
   welcome through 25 October. Learn more about the Rich Web
   Client Activity.

CSS Intrinsic & Extrinsic Sizing Module Level 3 Draft Published

   27 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9574

   The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group has published
   the First Public Working Draft of "CSS Intrinsic & Extrinsic
   Sizing Module Level 3." This module extends the CSS sizing
   properties with keywords that represent content-based
   "intrinsic" sizes and context-based "extrinsic" sizes, allowing
   CSS to more easily describe boxes that fit their content or fit
   into a particular layout context. CSS is a language for
   describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML
   and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. Learn more about
   the Style Activity.

W3C Renews Audio Working Group

   26 September 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9573

   W3C announced today the renewal of the Audio Working Group,
   whose mission is to add advanced sound and music capabilities
   to the Open Web Platform. The new charter adds a new
   deliverable, the Web MIDI API, which will provide a bridge
   between the browser and MIDI capable devices, such as musical
   instruments and controllers, and has great interest from the
   MIDI Manufacturers Association. The charter also clarifies the
   Web Audio API deliverable and timeline. See the Audio Working
   Group Charter for more information, and read more about the
   Interaction Domain.

       W3C Workshop on Web Performance
       http://www.w3.org/2012/11/performance-workshop/
       Mountain View, California
       Google
       There is a an industry-wide momentum towards adopting HTML5
       and its series of companion specifications to deploy
       applications based on the Open Web Platform. Some of those
       applications are facing however challenges with regards to
       their performances. While Web browsers are improving their
       implementations on an ongoing basis, not all of those
       performance issues are due to the speed of the
       implementations. Participants will look at a broad range of
       performance issues and how to address them.

       Shift into High Gear on the Web: W3C Workshop on Web and
       Automotive
       http://www.w3.org/2012/08/web-and-automotive/
       Rome, Italy
       Hosted by Intel and Sponsored by Webinos
       W3C’s Open Web Platform (OWP) is driving this and other
       industry transformations. The promise of the early
       information superhighway is being fulfilled. Whether
       tethering a driver’s smartphone or tablet to work with a
       car--or embedding technology into the car itself--there’s
       no need to reinvent the wheel. The Web can take you there.
       Participants in this workshop will have the opportunity to
       share their own perspectives, requirements, and ideas to
       ensure that emerging global technology standards meet the
       needs of the Web and Automotive industries.

       http://www.w3.org/2012/dnt-ws/
       Berkeley, California
       Hosted by UC Berkeley and TRUST Science and Technology
       Center
       This workshop serves as a forum for the W3C membership and
       the public to discuss the Consortium's next steps in the
       area of tracking protection and Web privacy. What have we
       learned from Do Not Track standardization and real-world
       implementations? Furthermore, undoubtedly support for
       privacy on the Web platform cannot end with Do Not Track:
       what should we look at next and beyond DNT?
