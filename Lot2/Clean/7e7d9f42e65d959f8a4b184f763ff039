Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Another Crystal Radio Question
My original question was meant to include radios at all and any
distance from one another and from the transmitting antenna.-- It
assumes them all to be crystal sets, so there are no issues of
amplification or AGC.  I find it hard to imagine that a million
crystal sets listening to a one watt transmitter (by sky wave, ground
wave ionospheric propagation or whatever means) would not produce a
sum total of more than one watt audio output to the million
headphones, yet conservation of energy says that this isn't possible.
Perhaps the answer is that I find it hard to imagine, but that's my
problem and that's the truth!

If all but one of the million crystal set listeners disconnected their
antennas from their crystal sets at the same time, would the one
remaining listener hear a sudden increase of signal?
