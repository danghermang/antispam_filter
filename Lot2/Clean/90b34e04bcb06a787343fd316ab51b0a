Subject:Re: [arin-ppml] Updates to 2012-6
While I support this policy as written.  I think it is important for the 
community to at least consider alternative approaches to this issue.

ICANN's New gTLD Program represents a significant departure from the 
original scope of gTLDs contemplated when the current critical 
infrastructure policy was originally considered and the ARIN community 
decided to include all TLDs (both gTLDs and ccTLDs) as critical 
infrastructure based solely on their location in the DNS hierarchy.

One such alternate approach could be to redefine critical infrastructure 
such that it is base on a objective standard of dependency by other 
systems and processes and not simply based on the fact that some word or 
string has been designated a TLD.  In other-words a TLD should only be 
considered critical infrastructure if it meets some threshold of 
dependency by other systems and processes, and not merely based on its 
location in the DNS hierarchy.

If a properly objective measure of dependency by other systems and 
processes could be found, it may also be reasonable to allow other parts 
of the DNS hierarchy, meeting this objective measure, to qualify as 
critical infrastructure as well.  Today, there are many large scale 
domain providers or even sufficiently critical individual domain names 
that are arguably as critical, or more, to the global Internet as many 
of the more obscure ccTLDs.  However, with the current definition being 
based solely on location in the DNS hierarchy, these other parts of the 
DNS hierarchy do not qualify as critical infrastructure in ARIN policy.

I have no doubt that some of the new gTLDs may eventually rise to an 
objective level of criticality that truly justifies the term critical 
infrastructure.  However, it seems fairly obvious that the vast majority 
of the several thousand gTLDs being considered will never meet such a 
standard and should not be considered any more critical than most other 
parts of the DNS hierarchy.

If the community supports this approach, I would suggest;

1. We ask the Board to suspend gTLDs as a justification for critical 
infrastructure, both for IPv4 and IPv6, until the ARIN policy community 
has time to reconsider the definition of critical infrastructure and 
recommend new policy.

1.A. Or, alternatively suspend everything other than Exchange Points as 
critical infrastructure for both both for IPv4 and IPv6.

2. Then focus our policy efforts on finding an "objective measure of 
dependency by other systems and processes" that all TLDs, and possibly 
other parts of the DNS hierarchy need to meet in order to justify being 
considered critical infrastructure and receiving preferential access to 
Internet Number Resources.

Is this a preferable approach to the proposed policy below?  Also, I'd 
be interested in other alternate approaches members of community would 
like to suggest.

However, without some kind of suspension of the current policy, I 
support the policy as written below to go to Last Call and be 
implemented ASAP.  The policy below is preferable to having the proposed 
new gTLDs potentially consume large amounts of IPv4 address space, 
exhausting the reservation and essentially preventing LXPs and other 
current critical infrastructure from have access to IPv4 resources as 
intended by the reservation created in ARIN-2011-4.

Thanks.
