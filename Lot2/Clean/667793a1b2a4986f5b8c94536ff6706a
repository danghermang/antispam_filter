Subject:[Hsqldb-user] FYI: Query timeout "limited" to 9.1 hours ( 32767
 seconds )

Hi,

I work in a large multinational software development company where we
develop enterprise level J2EE applications and though I'd share this
"gotcha".

Typically we use Oracle & DB2 and process huge volumes of data.
But for test purposes I tried running our product against HSQLDB and a
minimal set of data.

We have our transaction timeouts set in our Spring definition files for
36000 seconds, ie. 10 hours.

But I immediately got HSQLDB JDBC failures with Error -423, SQL State S1000,
invalid jdbc parameter anytime I tried writing anything to the database. 
Reading was okay.

Eventually I looked into the HSQLDB code and found that it the HSQLDB Query
timeouts were limited to less than Short.MAX_VALUE, which is 32767.
That translates to around 9.1 hours.

For me, the problem was obscured by JBoss, Spring, EhCache and HSQLDB.
And I made the change in a Spring bean definition, changing 36000 to 32766.

<bean id="transactionRequireNewProxyTemplate" abstract="true"
       
class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean">

    <property name="transactionManager">
    	<ref bean="transactionManager"/>
    </property>
    
    <property name="transactionAttributes">    	
      <props>
        <prop
key="*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW,-MyCompanyNameBaseException,timeout_36000</prop>
      </props>
    </property>
  </bean> 

I'm not sure why there's really such a short query timeout on HSQLDB.
But for us, when we swapped to HSQLDB it hit us.

Ps. it's a powerful little database and I love the Oracle compatibility
mode... keep up the great work!

regards,
Owen
