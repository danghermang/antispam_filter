I should let it go, I know, but can you seriously give credence to these re=
ports/ journo's agendas, when you've got gems like:

* Oliver (sure its not Vernon?) Kay...with the "sickening setback" of Chels=
ea's 3rd equalizer!

* 'Fergie's fledglings'...would that be the TWO young centre-backs or the l=
ikes of: Giggs, Fletcher, Nani, Anderson or Hernandez?

* 'ex-Barcelona star' Oriel Romeu - what the 1(1) appearance academy prospe=
ct?

* or even, the 'few inches' over the line Cahill header...I really feel edu=
cated that "few" extended to over a yard!!

They are pap, crass, biased, seem to know less than the average spectator a=
nd are almost universally more partisan than the average fan!

Some you wouldn't even honour with wiping your 'Sh**e" on!!

No, I am not.  When he plays next to JT, he seems to be kept under control =
a bit better but when left to his own devices his decision making can be su=
spect.
It's as if he has a 'mad moment'.

It gives me no pleasure and is definitely unscientific, however some journo=
 quotes from the papers:

*It was a silly mistake by Luiz who brought the ball out of defence and was=
 **easily caught out by Rafael's challenge*. - Independent

*...the Chelsea defender then reminded us of his own capacity for inviting =
trouble, running over the halfway line with the ball and being caught in
possession.*
*The Lu=EDz slalom undoubtedly looks good when it comes off, but it also ha=
s a **habit of endangering his team when he loses possession.*  -  Guardian

*Chelsea fans were then treated to the bad side of Luiz, the careless side.
He lost the ball in midfield, allowing Anderson to release Javier Hern=E1nd=
ez, who placed his shot unerringly past Cech. Roman Abramovich and his frie=
nd Andrei **Shevchenko looked at each other in frustration*.  -  Telegraph

*Unfortunately for Chelsea, there is far too much nonsense with David Luiz.
Carrying the ball across the halfway line does not constitute* *nonsense - =
even if plenty of coaches in England might disagree - but **doing so with r=
eckless abandon does*.  -  Times

*The Brazil defender played more of a role in United's second goal, taking =
the ball up field before watching it cannon back into Chelsea's* *half. Wit=
h the centre half stranded, Hernandez exploited the huge
gap....* -  Mail

*Unfortunately for Chelsea, that goal seemed to convince Luiz that he was a=
 striker rather than a centre-half and charging recklessly* *forward, he lo=
st possession to Rafael and left a gaping hole behind him for Anderson to t=
hread a pass through to Javier Hernandez.

Roman Abramovich, sitting next to Andrey Shevchenko in his executive box, s=
lumped deep into his seat as his team suffered yet another* *self-inflicted=
 wound from the =A322million Brazilian.*  -  Sun

Don't get me wrong, Luiz entertains me and can produce some magical moments=
, but I am not so blinded by this that I cannot accept his weaknesses.
I think if I were looking for an ideal description for him it would be that=
 he can be a 'loose cannon'
