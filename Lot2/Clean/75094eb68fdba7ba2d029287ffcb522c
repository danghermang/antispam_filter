Wow.

Didn't realise that Open source software and questions about it were that o=
ffensive.

As a predominantly Linux user, I figured my colleagues in the open source c=
ommunity might like to contribute to the shared knowledge for the benefit o=
f the next generation of computer users.

I'm now told they'll be running the 3.3 from the official Python repo, does=
 that make it less offensive?

Thanks at least to the previous poster (Robin) for confirming what my paran=
oia was leading me to.

And we wonder why cultural imperialism prevents the mass uptake of open sou=
rce software...

I'll take my questions elsewhere, I think.

Off-topic. Not even running on Cygwin. Take it to a Python list, Adam.
