Subject:Re: [child_lit] Philip Pullman and Neil Gaiman on the BBC Talking
 Grimm Fairy Tales
Jane is absolutely right, and of course we both made large and general
statements. That's rather the nature of a five-minute interview. What we
would no doubt have done in our longer conversation on stage that evening
would be context-ise, and subtle-ise, and nuance-ise those points, but much
to my great disappointment I was taken ill that day and couldn't make it. I
hope that one day Neil and I will actually meet and talk all these issues
through at proper length.
