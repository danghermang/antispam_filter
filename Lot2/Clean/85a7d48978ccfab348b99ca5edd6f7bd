Subject:Re: [EVDL] Ceramic Heater Installation
I'm telling you, I used the same schematic, and mine's worked fine for year=
s...
Might give Wistar at KTA a call, and he should be able to tell you which si=
de is anode and which side is cathode...?

Thinking about converting a gen. 5 ('92-95) Honda Civic?  See http://home.b=
udget.net/~bbath/CivicWithACord.html for DVD and tons more info!
