Subject:[Birding-Aus] large-tailed nightjar at Boonooroo
 

Good views of a pair of Large-tailed Nightjars and good numbers of migratory
waders were seen during a visit to Boonooroo, in south-east Queensland on
the Great Sandy Strait. The Boonooroo area is at the southern end of the
distributional range of the Large-tailed Nightjar.
