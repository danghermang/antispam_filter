Subject:Re: [child_lit] Children's books inspired by specific artefacts on
 public display in museums (any where in the world)?
What a fun book list!

The Blue Cat of Castletown, by Catherine Cate Coblentz,  is the story of a
folk art rug in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Warped, by Maurissa Guibord, is inspired by the Bayeaux tapestries

And this might be too non-fictiony for you, but perhaps not--How the Sphinx
Got to the Museum, by Jessie Hartland

Do you want books with paintings as well as artifacts?
