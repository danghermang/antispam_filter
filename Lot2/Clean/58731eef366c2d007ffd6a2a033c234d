Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Peterson field guide app for iPhone/iPad/iPod
	Touch free for short time
I have just tried to download the Peterson Guide using the link Steve provided, but was knocked back by a dialogue box saying that it is not available via the Australian App Store.

Tried again using the app store app that came with my iPad and it appears to be downloading OK.

So, if you get a knock-back via the link, try via the App Store.

Cheers,

Carl Clifford
