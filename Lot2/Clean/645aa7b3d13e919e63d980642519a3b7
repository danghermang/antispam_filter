Subject:[OzFurry] Big News about A Very Furry Halloween!
With Melbourne's A Very Furry Halloween weekend only 2 days away, we have
some pretty major news-

First the bad news (WHAT!?!?!)

If you haven't heard, today it was revealed by a prominent news source
that Sofia's Camberwell has been fined for poor food hygiene.

As such, in the interests of our attendees safety and wellbeing, The team
behind VFH have decided NOT to attend Sofia's this Friday night!

BUT THAT'S COOL ANYWAY, BECAUSE NOW WE GOT SOMETHING BETTER!

By a brilliant stroke of luck and some quick thinking, we have been able
to transfer our booking to La Porchetta's in South Yarra (It's right near
South Yarra Station!) Not only do we get a new booking in a gorgeous
restaraunt at such short notice (it's closer too)- they're throwing in
*drumroll* UNLIMITED FREE SOFTDRINKS!

WAHHHH YEAH! FREE STUFF!?!?!?! ALRIGHT!!

New Venue Details:
La Porchetta's South Yarra
93 Toorak Road
(Right near South Yarra Station)

To make up for the changeover, registration for Dinner on Friday night
will be open until 9pm on Thursday 25/10/12, so you *still* have a chance
to get in early! (limited spaces may be available on the night, but
pre-book to make sure you don't miss out)

Entry for Dinner is still $20, with free softdrinks! It'll be a night of
joy, laughter, good company and GREAT food!

It's not too late to sign up for the Very Furry Halloween dance party either!

 Come dressed for the spooky festivities on Saturday Night (or don't dress
up, we won't force you!). Entry is $20 and the bar will be open for most
of the night! Snack table for those essential refills and of course- A
TEAM OF DJs TO ROCK THE NIGHT AWAY!

There's also going to be a coffee crawl and Art Meet throughout the
weekend (See website for details)

Check out http://www.furryhalloween.com/ to book! All bookings for Sofia's
will automatically be transferred to La Porchetta's!

SEE YOU THERE GUYS!!!

BOOOOoooOOOOOOooooOOO!
