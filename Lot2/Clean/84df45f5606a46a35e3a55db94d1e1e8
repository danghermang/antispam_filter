Along the same lines (forgive me if I've posted this before, but it bears repeating): The Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators offers grants to areas hit by natural disasters to provide relief to libraries, schools, etc. SCBWI is an international organization; the first relief grant was awarded in Japan after the earthquake and tsunami.

To request a grant, write to your area's Regional Advisor (find her/him at http://www.scbwi.org/Pages.aspx/Regional-Chapters). You do not have to be an SCBWI member.

Hello everyone,

Greenwich Country Day School sponsors a book drive each year to benefit
local organizations that are interested in getting books into the hands of
children.

We get hundreds of terrific middle grade and YA books in very good
condition, (pre-screened by professional librarians) and were wondering if
there are organizations with an even greater need this year due to Sandy's
damage.

We can provide transportation, and storage until the institution is ready
to receive the books.

If you know of an organization that could benefit, please call or reply.

Thanks,

Sarah Abercrombie
