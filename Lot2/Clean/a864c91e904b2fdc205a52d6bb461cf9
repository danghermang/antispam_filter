Subject:Re: [Hsqldb-user] Enhancements in New Snapshot Jar
You are right. ADD_MONTHS has not been implemented. Should be working in
the next snapshot.

It generally works like A_DATE + N MONTH but if A_DATE is the last day
of a short month, it returns the last day of the target month. ( date
'2013-02-28' + 1 month compared to add_months(date '2013-02-28', 1) will
show different results)

There are some other new Oracle style functions such as TO_DSINTERVAL,
TO_YMINTERVAL, SYS_EXTRACT_UTC, SESSIONTIMEZONE, NUMTODSINTERVAL,
NUMTOYMINTERVAL, NEW_TIME, DBTIMEZONE etc. that are working. Most of
these functions simply fill the gaps left by the lack of proper SQL
Standard INTERVAL support in Oracle syntax. I will update the Guide by
the next snapshot to cover the recent improvements.
