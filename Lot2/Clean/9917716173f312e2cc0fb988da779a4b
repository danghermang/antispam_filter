Not exactly, the "Mean Time Between Fails," is a (Sort of) average
compilation over many units, not a particular units guaranteed failure
time. With most electronics the first hour of operation will be death for
80% of items destined to fail the first year, and the first ten hours will
bring the death of another 80% of those who didn't fail the first hour but
will the first year, that leaves about 96% to continue to work, and those
parts which don't fail in the first year are likely to continue to work for
ten more years, if you don't drop a screwdriver or wrench into the circuit
with power applied and "Murder" a component.
