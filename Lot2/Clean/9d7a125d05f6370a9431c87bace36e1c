Subject:[Chelsea] MIKEL MAKES AFRICAN SHORTLIST [TOCFCWS]
[HS: First senior nomination, unlikely to win it though. Nor be at the
ceremony as it's 3 days after the World Club Cup and the day after the
Leeds COCup game. He'll be knackered]

Posted on: Mon 05 Nov 2012

John Mikel Obi has been nominated for the 2012 African Footballer of the
Year award.

At the end an historic year for the midfielder in which he played a big
part in Chelsea becoming European champions and last month, helped
Nigeria qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations, he is in a list of 10
players in contention for the honour.

Our former striker Didier Drogba is also nominated; he is a previous
winner on two occasions.

Mikel was the Young African Player of the Year and named in the African
Team of the Year in 2005 when he was with his previous club Lyn Oslo.

The winner will be announced at a ceremony on 20 December in Accra,
Ghana.

The full list of nominees, which includes last season's winner Yaya
Toure is:

Alexander Song (Barcelona and Cameroon)
Andre Ayew (Marseille and Ghana)
Christopher Katongo (Henan Construction and Zambia)
Demba Ba (Newcastle United and Senegal)
Didier Drogba (Shanghai Shenhua and Ivory Coast)
Gervinho (Arsenal and Ivory Coast)
John Mikel Obi (Chelsea and Nigeria)
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Saint Etienne and Gabon)
Yaya Toure (Manchester City and Ivory Coast)
Younes Belhanda (Montpellier and Morocco)
