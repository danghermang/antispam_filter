Subject:Re: [EVDL] Best EV Tires
"As for the coast vs regen debate, it completely depends whether you are a
NY taxi driver (regen good) or live in rural Kansas (coasting good).  Steep
hills are better with regen, but flat or mellow hills is better with
coasting."

It depends more on how regen is implemented on the vehicle.  If it is on the
accelerator pedal and your throttle control (Hall or pot) is set for close
to its max voltage range, then you can easily continuously vary from motor
to generator, and hold it at any position along the curve, including zero
current, or coasting.  Then it does not matter what terrain you are driving,
having regen will be more efficient than not, and you will be able to coast
when you want.  Of course, if most driving is miles of open roads with few
stops or hills, you won't get much energy back from regen.  It will be more
efficient than coasting, but not a lot.

If regen is set up so you don't have much control, it is strongly on, or
completely off, then you won't be able to use it as above.  In this case you
can only apply it when you want to stop fairly quickly, as when you are very
close to a red light.  If it is applied sooner, it will slow the vehicle too
much so that you have to then accelerate to boost speed back up a bit.  If
you go through several cycles like this, the efficiency will be less than
just coasting since you use more energy during the acceleration phase than
during the regen phase.

It is all in how it is implemented, how much control of it you have.  Not
topography.
