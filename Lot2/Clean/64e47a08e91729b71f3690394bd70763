Newtjr,

When a selector pin is raised, this closes one of the 4 override switches in the selector unit. This then passes through the transfer switch to energize RY5 in the amp unit.

Ensure that the loading switch is on as well as the service switch on the junction box.

When RY5 is energized, 24v is supplied to one end of the changer motor through the service switch while the neutral to the other end passes through RY5(2-1), the transfer switch, RY6(normally close contact) and the loading switch. This will start the scan.

The above can be traced in the schematics.
