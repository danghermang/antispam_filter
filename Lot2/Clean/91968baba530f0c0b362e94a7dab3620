Subject:[Chelsea] FERNANDO TORRES FOR RADAMEL FALCAO AS CHELSEA CONSIDER
	ATLETICO MADRID SWAP [Star]
[HS: Please, God]

By Paul Hetherington

CHELSEA will have to offer Fernando Torres back to Atletico Madrid to
clinch the signing of Radamel Falcao.

The Champions League winners are tracking =A345million-rated Falcao.

But the Daily Star Sunday has been told that the Spanish club would
prefer a deal which would see them re-sign Torres as a ready-made
replacement.

Torres, 28, made his name at Atletico before moving to Liverpool, from
where he made a sensational =A350m switch to Chelsea.

Atletico have also been eyeing Manchester United=92s Javier Hernandez as a
potential replacement for Colombian hit-man Falcao.

But they are now talking about a reunion with Torres, who scored 75
goals in 174 league appearances for the club.

Falcao=92s scoring exploits for the Spanish side have made him one of the
most-wanted players in the world.

And Chelsea know they face fierce competition to land him from
big-spending Paris St-Germain =96 managed by former Stamford Bridge boss
Carlo Ancelotti =96 and Manchester City.

But they would move into pole position if they were prepared to include
Torres in the deal.

And the Spain striker, of course, would also have to agree to a return
to Madrid, where he was known as El Nino =96 which means The Kid.

Torres left his boyhood club for Anfield in a =A320m switch in the summer
of 2007 and was an instant hit with the Reds, netting 24 league goals in
his first season.

He joined Chelsea in January 2011 but has failed to recapture his early
form with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge.
