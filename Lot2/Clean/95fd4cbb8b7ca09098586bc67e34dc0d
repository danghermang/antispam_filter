Subject:[Jukebox-list] 1939 Penny Phono
Came across this unusual gem on Ebay and would like to know more about it.=
=A0 Looks like the machine has a program menu, was capable of making more t=
han one selection, but appears to have only one record.=A0 Maybe the record=
 had multiple tracks?=A0 Doubtful being that it's probably a 78.=A0 Seller =
says the record in it is warped and can't be played.=A0 Does anyone have in=
formation on this machine?
