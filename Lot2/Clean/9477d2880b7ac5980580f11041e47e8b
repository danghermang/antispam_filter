Ah but Alan Morley if he was still on here would have an opinion on how only needing a draw between two sides for both to go through in a competition most often does result in a drawn game. So we have to draw or win in Juventus to make the last games relevant at all. If we lose then we will see a draw in Donesk.

I'd consider playing Luiz in Turin alongside JT. He has not shown quite the same falibility when playing with JT, probably because JT marshalls the defense so well and does shout at Luiz to bring him in to the centre instead of loitering around the wing once he's been drawn out there.
