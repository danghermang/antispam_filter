Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Pluvialis ID Required in PNG
Hi John,
I was under the understanding that the diagnostic referred to primaries extending beyond the tertials too. (Not tail tip)
Also feet project past the tail in flight with PGP but not with AGP from what i remember too. Happy to be corrected by those more experienced though.

There are some photos in the link below from the 2009 Boat Harbour AGP
