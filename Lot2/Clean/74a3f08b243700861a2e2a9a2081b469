Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Whatever happened to.....
Really? Reports I read are that Boro fans think he's their best player
every week. I also read he went off on 70mins with a knock. Playing away
at Brighton is a comparatively tough game in the Championship.

Marin is now fit as far as I know - he has played a few minutes and
looked lively. I don't know if he'll be with the 1st team in Donetsk,
but I'm heading over to Telford for the U21 game at Wolves so I'll keep
a look out in case he gets another game there. However, the reason we
got him comparatively cheap is his recent injury record.

regards
Harry
