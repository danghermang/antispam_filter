ARIN has never structured its fees as a form of "sin tax" such that
people who do bad things (like not deploying IPv6) pay more. i'm not
saying we can't, i'm saying we havn't. if this consultation ends with a
clear consensus that we ought to do that, then we probably would. but i
would be surprised to see that result.

the fee waiver made sense to me in the years that we did it, because
ipv6 was in doubt. no longer.
