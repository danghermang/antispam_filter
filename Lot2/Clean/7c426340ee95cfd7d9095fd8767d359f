Ed, I only have diagrams for MM-2 but as for voltages -all Rowe machines of=
 that era used 30vac for the latch solenoid which was controlled by a 30vdc=
 relay.

The solenoid should be easy since it was common to so many models, the link=

=A0 I have a Rowe Ami MM3 button assembly, not the entire jukebox.=A0=A0=A0=
What is the voltage of the latch solenoid?
=A0 Does anyone have a diagram or schematic that describes the circuit for =

 I wish to use the original latch and hold circuit or something close to it=
.

=A0 I have asked a lot of questions but not specific enough and have gotten=
