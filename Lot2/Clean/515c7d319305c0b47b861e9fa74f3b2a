Subject:[child_lit] Younger reader/MC girl books
Hi,

For literary quality, I'd suggest Kevin Henkes' books. Three come to mind although the first two are over ten years old.

Protecting Marie reminded me of our daughter when she was the age of the main character. I recommended that she read it as an adult, and she loved it. I'm hopeful that my granddaughter, now seven, will read it in a few years and find herself in the character. She'll also find her name, Saffron, mentioned as a color twice in this book, which probably makes it unique for that alone.

Olive's Ocean was named a Newbery Honor Book and is about as good as books get, in my opinion. 

Junonia, published in 2011, is small in physical size and fits the uncluttered story of an only child who is celebrating her tenth birthday on a tiny island with her parents and old friends. Henkes is a genius at creating kids who are trying to fathom the adult world yet keep one foot in childhood.
