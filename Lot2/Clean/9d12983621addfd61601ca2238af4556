Let me cite ourself from the contribution website:
 To guarantee an upgrade path from stable+backports to the next stable, the
 package should be in testing.. Of course there are some exceptions: Security
 updates. If your package had a security update you can upload a new backport
 even if its not yet in testing. There are also some other exception for
 packages like the kernel, xorg or oo.org.
