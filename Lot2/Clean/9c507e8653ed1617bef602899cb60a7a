HF radars can detect slow-moving objects all right because they have a
frequency-resolution capability that can be designed to be as low as
needed.  The main problem is clutter.  For surface-wave systems in
particular, a problem lies in the Bragg-lines that are returned in the
spectrum of a developed wave structure on the surface of the sea.

Radar cross-section (rcs) is a huge subject with plenty
electromagnetic modelling being used that is way ahead of what we use
for ham antennas.  About 20 years ago I had a 27,000-segment NEC model
of a Boeing-707 used for modelling on the VHF comms band, but the size
of structures that are modelled (in wavelengths) is a significant
factor greater since then.
