Subject:[EVDL] Reply Subject:  Battery Terminal Torque
I worked on several HiPower packs at EMC
couple problems we had
2 of 10 the large nuts on the  battery post were loose, out of the box
biggest problem, the same nut on the posts is not threaded all the way down. 
Post is lower than nut, on 60% of them
so your terminal is tightening on the nut not the terminal
loosing a lot of contact and raise restiance.
you can see visually.
i inspected all then filed the tops flat
checking with a strait edge as i filed them
that was in 09 maybe they have fixed that, i don't know
