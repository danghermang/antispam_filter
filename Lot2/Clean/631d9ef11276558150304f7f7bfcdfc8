Hi Doruk,

welcome to the community :)

I am forwarding your mail to the translation mailing list. =


I checked Pootle and Turkish is already there (http://translate.koha-commun=
ity.org/tr/). So I think your problem with uploading the files might be rel=
ated to permissions. Uploading and merging doesn't work too well in my expe=
rience. So maybe if it's ok for the other translators you could upload your=
 complete files there. But as there is other translation activity for this =
language, you should try and check with the other translators first.

The po files can be updated to newer versions, this has been done on Pootle=
. Of course there is always some work to do, like translating the strings f=
or new features and checking old strings where the templates got changed. B=
ut it should not be necessary to completely retranslate.

Hope that helps,

Katrin

Thank you.

As a seperate but somehow related issue, we had had tried to be active
before actually but lacked communication skills I believe :).

We had had packaged Koha last year for a Turkish distribution called
Pardus (which resulted in us actually packaging a lot of Perl packages
and other stuff) for its LTS release. The distribution is
government-funded but unfortunately currently in disarray (due to
political power shifts).

We also had done a near complete Turkish translation of Koha 3.4 (the
latest release at that time) via PO files (Kbabel, etc). Then we
uploaded it to Pootle but it didn't get approved and merged (don't know
why). So we published it as a patch via a web page.

We're still using Koha 3.4 in our installations because of that and it's
going to be a real drag to merge strings or translate from scratch.

What is the correct way to make the translations? Pootle isn't really
practical for everyone, especially when translating offline, that's
why we had preferred PO file translation method. However we don't want
to risk making another version specific translation.
