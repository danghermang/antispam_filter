>>> BY STEPHEN CLARK
>>> SPACEFLIGHT NOW
>>> October 26, 2012
>>>
>>> The European Space Agency's Herschel space telescope, due to end its
>>> mission observing the infrared universe in March, may be sent on a
>>> crashing course toward the moon next summer to search for water embedded
>>> beneath the lunar surface, according to scientists.
>>>
>>> Suggested by an international team of more than 30 planetary scientists,
>>> the scenario is still working its way through ESA's advisory machinery
>>> before a final decision is taken by the end of the year by the agency's
>>> director of science.
>>>
>>> Herschel's $1.4 billion astronomy mission will end some time in March,
>>> when the observatory's cryogenic superfluid helium runs out. Herschel's
>>> three "world-class" imaging and spectroscopy instruments will almost
>>> instantly become useless as the last of the telescope's coolant drains
>>> out of an insulated dewar, according to G?ran Pilbratt, Herschel's
>>> project scientist at ESA.
>>>
>>> Fitted with an 11.5-foot-diameter primary mirror, Herschel is the
>>> largest telescope ever flown in space. It measures nearly 25 feet long
>>> and 13 feet wide.
>>>
>>> Designed to peer inside star-forming regions, discover distant galaxies,
>>> study interstellar dust, and observe objects within the solar system,
>>> Herschel's detectors are cooled as low as 0.3 Kelvin, or minus 459
>>> degrees Fahrenheit.
>>>
>>> When the telescope's helium supply is gone, Herschel's detectors will
>>> warm up and no longer be sensitized for collecting infrared light.
>>> Herschel launched in May 2009 with 2,300 liters, or more than 600
>>> gallons, of liquid helium, but the fluid gradually boils off in space.
>>>
>>> "When the coolant is gone, then Herschel is useless as an astronomical
>>> facility," Pilbratt said.
>>>
>>> After a brief period of engineering tests, controllers will move
>>> Herschel away from its station at the L2 libration point, a location one
>>> million miles from Earth where the gravitational effects of the sun and
>>> Earth balance.
>>>
>>> Because Herschel's orbit at the L2 point is unstable, ESA wants to guide
>>> the craft on a known trajectory.
>>>
>>> "The spacecraft needs to be put somewhere for posterity," Pilbratt said.
>>> "You don't want it to come hitting our heads."
>>>
>>> Two options are under serious consideration by ESA managers:
>>>
>>>     * Place Herschel into a solar orbit where it could not encounter
>>>       Earth again for at least hundreds of years.
>>>
>>>     * Guide Herschel on a course toward the moon for a destructive
>>>       high-speed collision to search for water. It would take about 100
>>>       days for Herschel to reach the moon, depending on which pole is
>>>       targeted.
>>>
>>> If approved, Herschel's moon mission would be a more explosive, and
>>> smartly targeted, encore to NASA's LCROSS lunar impactor, which struck a
>>> crater at the moon's south pole in 2009 and found water, according to
>>> Neil Bowles, a planetary scientist at Oxford University in the United
>>> Kingdom, who coordinates the research team proposing the use of Herschel
>>> for the water hunt.
>>>
>>> LCROSS launched in June 2009 with NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on
>>> a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket. The experiment consisted of a
>>> shepherding spacecraft and used the Atlas launcher's inert Centaur upper
>>> stage to smash into the moon at 6,000 mph, carving ice and rock from the
>>> floor of a permanently-shadowed crater.
>>>
>>> Sensors on the shepherding spacecraft detected water vapor in the debris
>>> cloud generated by the Centaur rocket's impact, proving the long-held
>>> hypothesis of ice cold-trapped inside polar craters which never see
>>> sunlight.
>>>
>>> In three years since the LCROSS mission, scientists have discovered
>>> signs of more widespread ice using temperature maps produced by the
>>> Diviner instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.
>>>
>>> Instead of only lying at the bottoms of dark craters near the moon's
>>> poles, where temperatures fall to minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit, ice
>>> could reside just below the surface in regions which periodically see
>>> sunlight.
>>>
>>> "The sun shines only very occasionally during the lunar year in some
>>> areas around the pole, so there maybe regions of permafrost just below
>>> the surface in these places," Bowles said.
>>>
>>> Herschel could provide a ground truth confirming the model predictions
>>> and Diviner's observations from orbit, said Bowles, who also serves on
>>> the Diviner science team.
>>>
>>> If locations with occasional sunlight harbor ice and other volatile
>>> compounds, such as sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde,
>>> ammonia, and methanol, the materials could be more accessible to future
>>> explorers.
>>>
>>> Astronauts living on the moon could harvest ice for drinking water,
>>> breathing air and rocket fuel.
>>>
>>> "There is the possibility that there is stable ice buried a few
>>> centimeters to a few meters below the surface, and that's accessible
>>> from an impact of a spacecraft with the mass and orbital dynamics of
>>> something like Herschel," Bowles said in a phone interview. "You should
>>> expect to see some of that material ejected, and if you can get the
>>> right instrumentation on the ground or from orbit, you can actually
>>> detect it."
>>>
>>> While LCROSS benefited from an up-close perspective with a shepherding
>>> spacecraft, a Herschel impact would be tailored for observations from
>>> Earth or space assets such as the Hubble Space Telescope and LRO.
>>>
>>> Spectrometers would try to measure the chemical constituents in the
>>> ejecta kicked up by Herschel and look for the signature of water.
>>>
>>> With its fuel tanks emptied, Herschel will have a mass of 2.8 metric
>>> tons, or about 6,172 pounds, slightly more than the Centaur stage used
>>> by LCROSS. Scientists expect the spacecraft would strike the moon at
>>> about 6,000 mph.
>>>
>>> "It's actually quite a different impactor [than LCROSS], but we would
>>> expect to excavate a similar-sized crater and have similar-sized
>>> ejecta," Bowles said.
>>>
>>> NASA projected the Centaur impact in 2009 would create a crater 92 feet
>>> wide and 16 feet deep.
>>>
>>> Bowles said he expects to hold a targeting workshop with the lunar
>>> science community in November to begin the process of selecting an aim
>>> point for a potential Herschel impact.
>>>
>>> "We have to keep moving forward hoping that it's going to happen until
>>> ESA tells us no or yes," Bowles said. "If it does happen, it's going to
>>> happen very quickly next year, so we have to get all of our observers in
>>> position."
>>>
>>> The earliest Herschel could be at the moon is about June or July of
>>> 2013.
>>>
>>> Officials say the cost to ESA of the lunar impact could be minimized by
>>> performing the spacecraft's closeout operations in parallel with the
>>> maneuvers toward the moon.
>>>
>>> "It is certainly lower than the cost of a purpose built mission with
>>> similar science goals," Bowles said.
>>>
>>> Some ESA officials are against the idea.
>>>
>>> "A lot of people find it interesting, but it's also true that some
>>> people really don't like the idea," Pilbratt said.
>>>
>>> "I think the people I know who have told me that they don't like the
>>> idea say it's more on emotional grounds," Pilbratt said. "They say
>>> that's not the way to finish off the spacecraft, or we shouldn't litter
>>> on the moon, things like that."
>>>
>>> It would not be the first time scientists have sacrificed a
>>> decommissioned space probe in their quest for lunar ice.
>>>
>>> At the end of its mission, NASA's Lunar Prospector orbiter was

>>> observers detected no evidence of water.
>>>
>>> Europe's SMART 1 lunar orbiter, China's Chang'e 1 spacecraft, and
>>> Japan's Kaguya probe made controlled impacts on the moon, but none were
>>> aimed at the lunar poles.
>>>
>>> "The lunar end seems somewhat traumatic, to say the least," said Paul
>>> Goldsmith, Herschel project scientist at NASA, a partner in the mission.
