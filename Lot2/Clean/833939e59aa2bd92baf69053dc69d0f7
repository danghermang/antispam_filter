Subject:Re: [CT Birds] Migrating in the rain

On Tuesday, October 9th, I was at the Hawk watch site at Lighthouse Point when, at 8:18 AM... bird time, it began to rain. At the same time Steve Mayo arrived. We both sat in our cars with bthe windows just cracked to talk. He noticed Kestrels to my left, and I noticed Kestrels to his right, in the rain. We went to the Pavilion, which was somewhat protected from the rain, where we then had 27 American Kestrels, 9 Sharp-shinned Hawks and 2 Northern Harriers fly through the park, all in the rain. The next hour, the rains had quit ane we had an additional 132 hawks for the hour. Yes, they fly in the rain.

I think all of us who hawk-watch at Lighthouse Point have had hawks 
migrating in the rain a few times. I remember once when I was there with 
Bill Banks. We were driven into our cars by the rain, but looking in 
different directions we could see hawks flying. Since we were seeing 
different birds we quickly developed an impromptu set of hand signals to let 
each other know what was going by. Not surprisingly, the species seen under 
such conditions are mainly ones that don't rely heavily on soaring, such as 
falcons, harriers and ospreys.

I'm sure this only happens with a fairly specific set of circumstances, such 
as birds moving through favorable skies that encounter a localized storm and 
just keep going.
