Yes, good point, Peter! The freebies and opportunity to purchase goods in
Second Life are great time savers and certainly enhance the experience.  I
recall exploring a shop that sold a range of healthcare items e.g. beds,
various machines etc...  Some were scripted too. So it gives the educator
some choice with regard to money and time spent in design.

Regards,
Anne

The other major advantage of SL is the availability of developers and
content, in the latter case both free and paid-for. Daden, for example, used
to have some basic freebies available from their paramedic simulations.
There are also many examples of the kind of thing you want to do and they
tend to be easier to find and access in SL. If you can partner with another,
more experienced institution, so much the better. The downside is the cost
and the fact you can't always take content with you if you change your mind
subsequently and want to migrate to OpenSim.

If you just want to practice moving some prims around, try OpenSim
sim-on-a-stick and you get a region (or mega-region) that will run from a
USB stick (probably best on a PC though I believe people have got it working
on Macs now). If you want multi-avatar access then Kitely, for example, will
give you a free region and two hours personal free use per month. You can
move regions from sim-on-a-stick to Kitely but the upload has a small cost
(I don't know the precise conversion but probably of the order of L$100).

Best wishes

Peter

Hi Sara,

It depends whether you are happy to have a sim on the mainland in Second
Life or want a private sim which gives the appearance of an island in the
middle of the ocean.

This link identifies costs for undeveloped land:
http://secondlife.com/land/privatepricing.php?lang=en-US . This is assuming
you are looking at Second Life.  However there are other sims in OpenSim you
may wish to explore e.g. JokaydiaGRID charges $25 per month per island sim.
The Kitely grid is another grid worth exploring. But you really need to
weigh up the pros and cons of the grids.  Second Life is certainly the most
stable grid I have come across and your students can visit other sims too,
perhaps saving you some work.  Then you can focus on developing your unique
designs.

Hope this helps.

Kind Regards,
Anne

How much does owning land that could be used for nursing simulation cost? I
want to try to pursue this idea.

Thanks!
