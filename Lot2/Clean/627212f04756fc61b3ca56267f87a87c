Subject:[bcp] Rider leaders and riders: info on cancelled rides
I would like to take a minute and discuss ride cancellations, regarding rid=
e leaders and riders. But first, I hope that everyone gets through the stor=
m with no or minimal damage, and secondly that we'll have serviceable roads=
 soon enough after the storms.=A0 =



Ride leaders: If you are cancelling a ride, please be sure to cancel it via=
 the BCP website. To do this, log in to the website, go to the specific rid=
e that you are looking to cancel, click on "edit/cancel this ride," and the=
n click on "cancel" near the top of the next screen. This simultaneously ac=
complishes two things: 1) it will send out an email to the ListServe that t=
he ride has been cancelled, and 2) it will populate the ride description to=
 add "cancelled" to the description (not everyone subscribes to the ListSer=
ve, so its important that the description is also updated). =



Riders: Check your emails, the website, or call/email the ride leader to fi=
nd out if the ride is cancelled. =



Thanks. Be safe.
