Hi Rob,

Thanks for the reply. That is something so out of the box I had never
considered. However, I am pretty certain that the issue does not occur =
when
a B side (no toggle required) is selected, which kind of points to your
theory.

I will try that. I have a spare one if it is the problem.=20

Much appreciated Rob. It is going to be one of those weird type of =
issues,
as I have exhausted all other avenues and I know usually this fix has =
easy
answers.

Regards

Nigel

Nigel, try removing -both- leads from the toggle shifter solenoid.

back in the mid-eighties there was an MM2 in an op's shop that plagued =
them
with this action for over a week. I looked at it and noticed that this
happened when the toggle shift occurred.=20

The coil had an intermittent bobbin-core short. I guessed that it pulled =
the
voltage down just enough for the mech relay to fall out and hop the =
basket.

May not be the issue here, but it'll only take a few seconds to try.

BTW: Those mechs are fairly forgiving and reliable, so any decent
microswitch will work.=A0 If you test them try to use an analog meter or =
small
low voltage bulb and battery.
