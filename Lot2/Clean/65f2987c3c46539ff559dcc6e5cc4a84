Hi Allan,
The Wood Sandpiper in Jamestown, RI (7th record for lower 48 states) has been 
seen daily, including 10/18,  since its discovery on 10/13 by Carlos Pedro. 
 Here is the most recent email update by Rachel Farrell <pollypie@att.net>

The Wood Sandpiper was in the NW corner of Marsh Meadows in Jamestown through at 
least 3:45 PM.  Please call me (cell: 401-439-6124) or email if the bird is seen 
on Friday.  Great interest in this bird continues, as there are at least 2 
organized groups as well as many individual birders planning to try for it on 
Saturday.
 
 
 From George Welly, 10/18:
Eighteen birders assembled off the path behind the Jamestown water treatment 
plant, just past the white pipe; about one hundred minutes after the tide turned 
(receded), the subject became very active feeding and eventually wandered within 
35 feet of the scopes and cameras. With the light behind us, some incredible 
photos should show up.

Does anyone have an update on whether or not the Jamestown, RI Wood Sandpiper is 
still being seen?  RI Audubon hotline (401-949-3870 has not been updated since 
Oct. 14.  Any websites, phone numbers or contacts where an update can be found 
is appreciated.

Thanks,
