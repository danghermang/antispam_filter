May well be true. Then again, if people are out looking for them at night in
all kinds of conditions, people are going to detect more of them on clear,
full moon nights. Indeed counting birds eclipsing the full moon as they fly
past at night, is one survey method.

Birds Fly In Clouds - And at Night.


I heard an interesting story from some experienced birders in Japan that
birds tend to migrate with the full moon, and therefore the days following a
full moon are the best time to look for them at migration hotspots such as
headlands and offshore islands. I suppose this correlates with the theory
that birds prefer a bright night if they are flying through the darkness. Of
course, in adverse weather conditions they will remain at a location and
rest and feed while waiting for favourable conditions. And around a new moon
perhaps they fly through the day rather than night.....
