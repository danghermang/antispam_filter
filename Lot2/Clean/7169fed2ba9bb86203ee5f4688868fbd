Subject:Re: [EVDL] Calb battery issue
This is the same solution to this problem we do with lead acid batteries.
If you operate in cold weather I suggest anyone do the same.

And from a post further up, I've been buying batteries for over 20 years
now,  good luck trying to get ANY manufacturer to honor a warranty if its
not a visual defect upon delivery.  The proof they want is impossible to
provide without a cost in monitoring that is more than the pack you bought.
 There are manufacturer parameters in starting batteries that are rarely
exceeded throughout the life of a car.  In an EV or any deep cycle
application, everyone always exceeds the manufacturers recommendations at
some point.  If they didn't they would be able to prove it.  And if you can
prove it a Battery manufacturer would honor their warranty.  It may have
happened that someone could "prove it", only once that I know of, and it
wasn't in an EV application.
