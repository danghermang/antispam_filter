Did you install with packages or a tarball?

If packages, you should use:
$ koha-rebuild_zebra -v -f {instance name}               (where you replace 
{instance name} with what you called your instance)

If tarball, you should run:
$ sudo -i
# su - {user that does the indexing}          (the tarball instructions 
usually suggestion koha as the user, so it is likely koha, but I make no 
promises)
$ /usr/share/koha/bin/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -b -a -r
(I do the sudo -i and su -, because you more likely know your password than 
you remember the user's that does the indexing)

If you didn't do this, then you may have permissions issues and may need to 
chown -R the appropriate directories.

The errors you gave are not related to to your indexing problem.

-- This is another reason the packages are very, very nice. If you use the 
commands provided by the packages, you will never end up with permission 
errors. :)


If there are still genuine indexing problems afterwards, I would use the 
script on http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=6566

Place the script in 
/usr/share/koha/bin/migration_tools/checkNonIndexedBiblios.pl and assuming 
the
user you (or the packages) created for indexing is called library-koha 
(change it to the user you use for indexing if you use tarball):

$ sudo -i
# su - library-koha
$ echo $KOHA_CONF
[this should be set to the proper value]
$ echo $PERL5LIB
[this should be set to the proper value]
$ /usr/share/koha/bin/migration_tools/checkNonIndexedBiblios.pl -c -z

In our migration from tarball to packages, we had indexing problems. A full
reindex said there was a malformed tag, but I couldn't find it.
I started this at night and went to bed:
$ while true; do 
/usr/share/koha/bin/migration_tools/checkNonIndexedBiblios.pl -c -z; sleep 
360; done
In the morning everything was properly indexed (0 records added), so I just
had to kill the process with a CTRL-C.

It works knowing that the zebra indexing is triggered automatically every 5
minutes in packages. So, by sleeping 6 minutes, that let's at least some
indexing happen before retrying. This, of course, will bloat the zebra queue
table, but the packages have a script to automatically clean that up already
installed. I tried the sliced reindexing and it just messed up our indexes
again. So, this is the method I'm sticking with. Your mileage may vary.

GPML,
