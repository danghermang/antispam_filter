Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] Meteorite-list Digest, Vol 112, Issue 35
Now HERE'S a question I bet has never arisen on here...I have a new
THR(total Hip Replacement--nice chunk of metal into my leg and
metal/plastic cup in ball joint)...while doing very well in recovery
at day 86 post surgery, I saw the mention of the Meteorite stick, with
the XXL magnet..Methinks if this got too close to my new hardware, I'd
be in BIG trouble!
Comments welcomed!
I don't want to have to call 911 and make the evening news...
Just D..... glad to be off a walker, and walking with just a cane now.

> Opportunity is continuing a local area survey around the location called
> "Matijevic Hill" (named in honor of Jake Matijevic) at the inboard edge
> of Cape York on the rim of Endeavour Crater.
>
> The rover performed three survey drives on Sols 3105, 3107 and 3110
> (Oct. 18, 20, and 23, 2012), driving first west, then southwest, and
> then southeast, totaling 226 feet (69 meters). Each drive was preceded
> by the collection of targeted imagery and then followed by taking a
> 360-degree Navigation camera (Navcam) panorama. On Sol 3109 (Oct. 22,
> 2012), an atmospheric argon measurement was collected by the Alpha
> Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS). The plan ahead is to conduct more
> survey drives around this location.
>
> As of Sol 3110 (Oct. 23, 2012), the solar array energy production was
> 575 watt-hours with an atmospheric opacity (Tau) of 0.654 and a solar
> array dust factor of 0.619.

> Total odometry is 21.87 miles (35,189.68 meters).
