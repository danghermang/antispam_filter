Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Update on Franklin Gull Please
Hi all A further update from today. Gull was seen in several locations around Payneville despite the terrible weather. I made the decision yesterday to duck down to Payneville and despite leaving later than I wanted I arrived around 10:00 am. Unfortunately on the way I obliterated a suicidal kangaroo at 100 km/h on the freeway near Longwarry... I must have driven this road several hundred times in the past 20 years and have never even seen one there.  The gull was the first gull I saw in the previously mentioned location opposite the hardware store seen from the road as I drove in... far too easy. As I arrived the cold front hit with full force with crazy wind and rain. The gull was with a group of cormorants and pelicans as also previosuly mentioned. After observing for a couple of minutes from the shelter of the car it flew off east. I followed along and relocated it with another group of cormorants and pelicans at the far side of the Bight Slip Marina where I again observe
 d for around 10 minutes taking a couple of proof of life pics - the weather precluding any better attempts. It then flew back to the original location where it stayed briefly before flying over to the opposite bank on Raymond Island where it would have been easily observable through a scope. Having now seen the bird from all angles I headed off in search of food and better weather. Being in the area, I dropped in at Mitchell River National Park on the way home picking up some nice Victorian birds like Leaden Flycatcher, Black-faced Monarch, Brown Gerygone etc. Unfortunately Park Road and Mitchell Road are currently closed which are some of the best birding locations in the park. thanks to all who have reported information on the gull and good luck to those heading down on the weekend. CheersTim

> Hi All,
>  
> Thank you for the info. I did see the bird & got a couple of dodgy photos!
> I arrived at 7.30am after a 5 hour drive. Initially I was in the wrong spot, there is a hardware opp. the ferry, south of the canal, which is south of the large gravel area where the bird had been seen.
> I spent the first few hours searching along the shoreline in both areas, i.e. north & south of the small canal, in amongst all the yacht moorings & scanning anything that flew by that looked like a gull or a tern.
> After that I decided to jump on the ferry & go across the canal & check around the shore of Raymond Island, still no luck.
> Around 12.30 I came back to the original area outside the Hardware, on the gravel carpark. While standing next to my car (on the phone to work!!) I had to hang up cause I saw a bird coming towards me from the north, it looked gull-like but flight more tern-like very slightly. I grabbed binos just as it passed but I got a glimpse of black on head. I also noticed on the back its colour was slightly browner-silver than the silver of a silver gull, & the wings seemed to be edged white on top. It was heading south so I jumped in the car & raced around to the south of town, but could not see it from the car park to the left of the playground. About 250 m to the south I saw a group of gulls around a car that looked like they were being fed, so I raced over there. As I got near I noticed a single gull hanging back from the others & it had a black head!! I pulled over near by, grabbed my camera & as I took my first photo it took off. I managed 3-4 quick snaps
>  as it flew past, I grabbed binos & saw it from behind again as it flew back towards the north. I spent 20 more minutes trying to locate it again but with no luck. The group of gulls that were being fed were on a grassy area in front of a craft centre, southwest of the main shopping area of town.
> All up, I got about 15 secs view of the bird but it made the drive home very sweet.
> Thanks again to all who answered my request, particularly Tim, whose good oil was very useful.
> Good luck to all who chase the little beauty
