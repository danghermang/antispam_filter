Subject:Re: [burners] [Autosub] Large format scanning
Hi all,

FedEx Office has many locations in the Boston metro area and has DIY large 
format scanners/printers.  I use them all the time for my architectural 
drawings, easily up to 36x42 and larger.  Staples has the same service but 
not DIY and therefore Staples cost is just a bit higher...but you do get the 
service.  FedEx Office prices are a few dollars per large size B&W paper 
print and a couple of bucks per B&W scan and you just take them with you on 
your thumbdrive.  The B&W quality is excellent..what you put in comes back 
out...maybe 300dpi?

I am not sure of the availability of double-sided large format B&W printing 
as I have not had a need for that, but if it can be scanned, I would think 
it could be double-sided printed.

There are plenty of blueprinters around Boston who do this large format 
scanning/printing as a service to design offices but the FedEx DIY or 
Staples route may be cheaper and can be done on your own time (weekends, 
evenings, etc.). The commercial printers will send you the images via email 
or burn a disk and may put them on a thumbdrive, but I am not sure.

Bill
