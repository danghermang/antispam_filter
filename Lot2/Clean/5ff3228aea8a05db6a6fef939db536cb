The French version must be resynched from the data in the translation
tool. It is full of very horrible typos and grammatical errors (plus
completely wrong reinterpretations of the English source).

Who entered this ? I corrected a lot (the version used last year,
certainly did not have all those errors, so someone destroyed the work
done correctly last year by typing everything he wanted), and reviewed
it completely, in almost all items.
