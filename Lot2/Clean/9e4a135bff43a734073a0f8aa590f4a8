Subject:Re: [EVDL] Cross Country EV?
Eric,

I am going to define your words:
driving cross country long distance
as meaning driving across the U.S. from coast to coast.

No matter what EV you drive across country, a production or conversion
EV, you will have to first establish a route to use all 6kW charging
EVSE available, and be sure to have secondary alternatives for each
stopping point. Also include your physical needs, i.e. a motel, as even
driving a fuel vehicle, you will need to rest your body.

Visually overlaying a Google map of the U.S. with what charge points are
shown on recargo.com and or carstations.com shows you will have the best
charging point hit ratio along a route similar to highway 40.

There are EVs you could use to drive Electric across the U.S.

If you have a fat bank/expense account, then nab yourself a Tesla S EV.
Not only has it the range to bridge any charging gap you find, but Tesla
is installing a huge cross country quick charging (Tesla Superchargers)
infrastructure (I will have another newswire piece on that later). I
would also carry an assortment of adapter cables to allow for
compatibility with all 6kW power sources: J1772, Tesla, 14-50, etc. and
of course also include your trusty level-1 adapter for emergency slow
charging.

A less expensive EV would be either a Leaf EV or a Focus Electric
depending on what charging is available along the route you choose. 

The advantage with a Leaf EV is you could charge at Level-3 CHAdeMO, but
you would have a disadvantage at level-2 as Nissan and Mitsubishi went
cheap and only installed a half-powered 3kW on-board charger. So,
recharging even at a level-2 EVSE capable of 6kW, you only can pump 3kW
into your pack at a time ( :bummer: ) . The Leaf is more established
across the country so, if break-down repairs were a priority concern,
Nissan had more dealerships prepared for Leaf repairs.

If your route has little to no level-3 CHAdeMO charging, and plenty of
level-2 6kW charging, then the Focus Electric with its full powered
on-board 6kW charger would be a better choice. Since it is a
compliance-car (an ice retro fitted by the factory to Electric) and not
a purpose built EV (like the Leaf), it has less range because of
inefficiencies. But with a lighter touch of the foot on the accelerator
and the faster on-board charging, that overcomes the less pack range
(its about 15% less).

Lastly, as was mentioned, you could have a 100+mi conversion truck. The
best you could do is have level-2 6kW charging. But the cost of the
project would be at best, the cost of the Focus Electric and you would
have to build it (some people prefer building rather than buying -
whatever floats your boat).

I speak from medium-distance EV driving experience from way-back when
there was no public EVSE like today. Back then it was Avcons, 14-50s, or
whatever we could beg, borrow or steal. I had six on-board chargers so
that I could mix and match what outlets I found to get as much power as
possible. There was no way I would attempt a cross country trip though,
the charging infrastructure was just not there like it is today. I did
achieve a 320 mile round trip from Silicon Valley to Sacramento and back
on six different occasions. It was fun when I did it, but now that I
have, I would not go through that again because we have today's better
technology and infrastructure.


So Eric, why do you want such an EV? 
Are you planning a trip? 
Did you know that it has already been done several, several, several
times already, and no one (except the driver) really cared?

A 100 mile EV is about all one should really be planning for. If you
drive more than that, then just drive a high mpge fuel vehicle.

We all need to look at what our daily driving needs are, and
purchase/build an EV that fits those needs. While a cross country EV can
be purchased or built, you will need to tell us why you would need an EV
with those capabilities (what are you trying to prove?). 

I like to leave the public who state all vehicles will be Electric in
the future with, well, not all all. There are some who drive really long
distances daily and or have jobs that are reactionary that need to here
there everywhere on a moments notice. For them an EV would not be the
best choice. After all, one does not try to make an Electric Space
Shuttle (its the wrong application for an EV).
