Subject:Re: [child_lit] An African-American friend asks who read what?
I watched a British documentary about American TV comedy the other day -
something I have only a very partial view of, being in the UK. One of the
most surprising things to me was that viewers were (and had been from about
the 1990s) seen by programme makers as dividing on racial lines, to the
extent that they even made "black" and "white" versions of the same show,
or at least shows using the same format. Hence, *Friends* didn't get a huge
black viewership, but there was an African American version with the same
premise (six single twenty-somethings in NYC); and the same with *Sex and
the City*. I'm afraid I don't remember the name of either show, but perhaps
someone here can supply it.

Now, I don't know how reliable this documentary was, but I found it
intriguing that the audience split so dramatically on racial lines that it
warranted the commissioning of a whole new show. (Then I remembered hearing
that in the US version of *Blind Date* they didn't use interracial couples
either - as they did in the UK, for instance.) Now, the way in which books
are produced is quite different from TV shows, but perhaps the way they are
marketed and perceived isn't *so *different? Is there, in fact, a black
American canon that tends not to get acknowledged in the white-dominated
media - or indeed on discussion lists? Has any book been promoted as "the
African American Harry Potter"? Are there books with white protagonists
based on books written by people of colour, books perhaps less known to
white readers than their Caucasian knock-offs? Will there be a revival of *=
The
Wiz* any time soon?
