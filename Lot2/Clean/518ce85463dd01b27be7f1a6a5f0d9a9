Subject:Re: [bcp] Calling all Garmin 800 (or any other model) Users for Help
Interesting info about the solar activity. Although I wish I could blame more things on sunspots I don't think I would look there first in this case. Here are a few things that I've discovered that might be helpful:

1. If you kick the cadence sensor, the magnet moves on the spoke, or if the distance is marginal you will get erratic readings.

2. There are software defects that can cause problems. I found one that is completely reproducible on the Edge 800 concerning pause and restart last week.

3. If you use the GPS reception alone to determine your speed the readings are much more erratic than using the wheel sensor. This is especially true when you are in a heavily wooded area or reception is otherwise impaired.

Hope this helps

While the GPS satellites should be hardened against their effects, it's possible that the civilian side of the satellites are less robust than the USAF side.  (Remember, GPS is built for and paid for by the US Air Force  [actually, by you and me through that part of our taxes that go to the USAF].  Civilians use a degraded, that is less accurate, signal than the military.)
