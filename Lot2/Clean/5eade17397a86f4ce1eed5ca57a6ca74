Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Need Help Reducing Splatter

Jim,You need to balance all the components in your audio chain, so that one is not u nderpowered and another is making up for it by being over-powered.  You're describing a classic audio overdrive problem in PSDR that is easily fixable with this software. In essence, you start with a mic gain at about 35 and everything else in the audio chain off.  Then speaking in a normally strong voice, you set each level (EQ, Leveler, DX, etc etc) so that the ALC level never exceeds -1dB.   Takes about 5 minutes per TX profile.

> Setup:
> Flex-3000
> Heil GM-5 dual element, or Heil HM-Pro
> selectively/as-needed feeding Ameritron ALS-500M to LDG AT-1000 to either G5RV or TA-36
> all gear home-run bonded to common hard ground (not looped through other gear)
> (the TA-36 is fed with 1/2" hardline, decoupling coil at the boom, tower and feedlines are grounded at the entrance before 20 foot run into the rigs)

> Watching the panadapter display on transmit I've got good tight signal within the TX filter settings, and if I don't talk too loud it stays that way, but I get requests to speak up... when I do there is a lot of energy to the sides, energy 80-90 db down at the filter edge sloping 100-110db down out to 4-5 KHz either side.

> When this occurs there is a small amount of garbled energy getting into in-shack audio system, and thanks to how wonky USB gear is, causes devices on one cheap hub to disconnect (guess that hub goes in the trash.) Otherwise - no other 'TVI' locally or complaints from the neighbors.
