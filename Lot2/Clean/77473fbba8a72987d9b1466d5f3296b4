	thru2300-2400 manuals.
I signed up a while ago for access to the manuals and find it a very good 
source to get info from. While the collection is not complete and does cost 
money like you say James, it is worth it for research on a number of 
different boxes. Some of the pdf's are no better then Vern's but then again 
people have to remember that someone probably took the time to scan a manual 
or schematic and send it to them.

I considered storing manuals on my web site but then saw no reason to 
because they are already there.

Shankar:

After seeing your email, I visited www.arcadeboneyard.com which takes you to
their home page.   If you click on the category "PDF manual library" you 
will be
asked your password (you have to be a paid subscriber @ $26/yr.)  Entering 
that
file gives you access to big library of jukebox,pinball and video game
manufacturer's manuals. The home page says it was last updated 10/24/12 
(today)
at a given time.     The juke library isn't 100% complete but there are many
entries there.  They all appear to be high quality scans of entire paper
manuals, including schematics.    Subscribing to this service is worthwhile 
if
you need access to a lot of service manuals in these technical 
disciplines,or
if you do quite a bit of jukebox repair work.  You will be required to
"hopscotch" around these file pages to gain access to everything.  I'm 
assuming
the author does this in order to manage the huge amount of bandwidth a site 
like
this requires.

  In some cases, the schematics posted for no charge at Vern Tisdale's 
website
(www.verntisdale.com) are sufficient, but these are pretty much limited to 
juke
amplifier/sound system schematics.  Tisdale's library of amplifier 
schematics is
pretty complete for older machines.

Hope this helps you,

Jim Alexander

I just went to the http://www.arcadeboneyard.com/ link and it looks to be
completely blank.  I tried it in both Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer.

the 2304 models were covered in a separate manual. Just for grins, I opened 
the
W1700 manual. There is much more ink/space devoted to describing the "new"
104-select record changer in greater detail here.   The same changer 
description
is shown in the W1800 manual. (both are AMR reprint editions)  For someone
needing an in-depth description of this carousel mech, this tells and shows 
you
a lot more.  There is a 10-step (RockOla style) package of electrical 
sequence
schematics, with the "current-flow" circuits highlighted beginning on Pg 71 
of
the manual, ending on Pg 91.  The mechanical description of the record chgr
operation begins on Pg 35 ending on Pg 60 for mech operations that apply 
mech
motor and main cam operations. I'm willing to scan and post a few pages of 
these
instructions with photos if someone needs them,however I'm not willing to 
take
the time to post lots & lots of pages. Any scans will have to be routed 
directly
to the recipients'
email address.  They can't be posted to the juke-list due to bandwidth
restrictions.  If you have a need for lots of different jukebox manuals, I
suggest you visit the www.arcadeboneyard.com website. He has high quality 
scans
there of many complete older juke manuals, but there will be a yearly
subscription fee payment ($26, I believe) required for admission. Jim

What
is the procedure for dismantling of the jukebox to get to the mechanisms for
cleaning and lubrication? I am sure there is a proper procedure that will
minimize chance of harming the other componets. I also am still trying to 
find a
listing of the sequence of operations of the 2410. I understand this should 
have
been in my manual but it is not there.
Hopefully one of you could make a copy and and send it to me. Thanks, Pat
