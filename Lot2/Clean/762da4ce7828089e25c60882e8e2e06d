Subject:Re: [Coral-List] DR. Starck conflict of interest?
Thank you Ian for stressing this important node.
The point, however, remains that we know what's going on. But people 
like Dr. Starck get to the news. We don't...

Maybe besides finding effective ways to communicate about climate change 
(and many other topics) we should also help people understand what is 
like being a researcher... I mean, the good that kids dream of, but also 
the bad that we deal with on a daily basis - including but not limited 
to struggling with spending reviews, unstable careers and harsh private 
choices. Never asked yourself  "what for? And sitll running...

Another point that may be good to clarify with the public is that 
scientists judge and validate science (although I agree that the 
peer-reviewed process is not flawless). That's a great example of people 
working for free for a common cause that is the advancement of our 
understanding of the world, for the common good.

Are there interests at stake in this? For sure yes, nothing human is 
perfect. Yet, I like to believe that most of the system is real...

> I'd just like to add an interesting point to the topic - Dr. Starck heavily criticizes ecologists for what has been dubbed "getting rich" off their work.  Dr. Starck states that lack of disclosure of conflicts of interests in funding that overshadows outcomes of studies: I would assume implying that one hand washes the other and resulting in some large scale conspiracy that governments and researchers and managers all lie in the same bed to vindictively control access to resources?

> Has anyone questioned the conflict of interest from Dr. Starck's persepective?  Among other great works and groups Dr. Starck has been a member of (he has spent a substantial effort extorting his life's works - which DO include a number interesting and novel works), he is a member of the Scientific Adivsory Panel of the Australian Climate Science Coalition, "a climate change skeptics website created by the the Australian Environment Foundation (AEF), a spin-off group created by the the corporate funded think tank, the Institute of Public Affairs."

Among these businesses are ExxonMobil,[4] Telstra, WMC Resources, BHP Billiton, Phillip Morris,[5] Murray Irrigation Limited,[6] and Visy Industries..  IPA donors have also included Clough Engineering, Caltex, Shell and Esso..[7] Other donors were electricity and mining companies, as well as British American Tobacco (BAT).[7]"  The IPA also has ties to American think-tanks such as the Heartland Institute.

> Sorry,but my impression on the argument by Dr Stark is that its rather confusing and not well presented.Climate change is no longer an issue for discussion but a reality and engaging in an argument stating otherwise indicates a person who wants to draw attention to himself or someone who has strong vested interest that need protected by denying the reality.
