Anders in computer games online, people who don't know much are called
"noobs". I am one of those when it comes to football, although as you may
have noticed I am fond of expressing my ill conceived opinions.

Now this position is new to me. "Middle-wide longitudinal defensive lines".
Is Luiz even capable of understanding that, because I'm not, and how the
hell do you teach a man to play that in coherence with the rest of the team
when probably none of them know wtf that is. You can't adopt that system
for one game, especially a crucial one. And as far as I'm concerned you
can't trust a clown in central defence or one position removed. The closest
you let him get is wingback or def mid.
