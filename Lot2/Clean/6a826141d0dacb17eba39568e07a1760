	Talking	Grimm Fairy Tales
Interesting about the girls next door to the Grimms. Feminists often make
the point that the stories were told by woman - often uneducated - and they
left out lots because they were speaking to educated males and felt shy
mentioning things like menstruation and other bodily functions. I've always
been interested in this aspect, so I'd also really like to hear if anyone
else knows anything about the mysterious girls next door! =

Grimm Fairy Tales

Two lectures I'd love to hear!

I lived briefly just down the road from Hanau, the hometown of the Grimms,
and I loved hunting up different German versions of the tales. It's been a
long time but I do remember, as Philip mentioned in the all too brief
interview, some really good stories that I'd never seen in English. I also
remember some tales that seemed blatantly political. I'd love to learn more
about the politics of the day when the Grimms were writing. Their main
occupation was compiling a German dictionary and grammar, which is in some
respects a political act. The tales were just a sideline that eventually got
more attention than their other linguistic endeavors. =


I also heard from neighbors and librarians in my town that it wasn't the
Grimms at all who collected the fairy tales but the girls who lived next
door who went out and interviewed grandmother-storytellers. But I've never
heard that information in anything I've read about the Grimms since. I'd
love to learn more about that as well. =


It's been great fun to have the Grimm TV show filming here in Portland
although I've sometimes had to reroute my daily hike because they were
filming yet another gruesome murder on my favorite walk.
