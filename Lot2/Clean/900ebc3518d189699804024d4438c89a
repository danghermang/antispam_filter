Subject:[burners] [OT] Discover Roxbury pop-up shop: Holiday Art and
 post-holiday fashion show
If you believe commerce is commodification, please stop reading now and go
on to the next message.

Discover Roxbury is happy to announce that it will be using a vacant
storefront in Dudley Square, Boston and transforming it into a holiday
pop-up shop for artists and craftspeople from November 30-December 24.
Participation is open to artists and craftspeople from New England, with
vendors chosen by a juried process.

I am a proud board member of Discover Roxbury and would love to see burners
represented in this pop-up shop.  There may also be opportunities for DJs
or performances to liven things up, so let me know if you're interested.

Also, there are plans to use the space in January for a unique fashion-show
experience, so if you're a seamstress/seamster we've got something just for
you!

The space itself is directly accessible from the Silver Line from downtown
and both the 1 and 66 Buses running from Cambridge.
