Hi Steve,

Can you see the one from me that says 'Judith Hoyle has shared an album with you'.  That should take you to the pictures that I uploaded onto Picasa this morning.  Let me know if it doesn't and I will work on it.

Regards

Judith

Hi Judith,You can't send attachments such as photos thru to birding-aus, any attachments sent are automatically removed/dropped.To share photos on birding-aus, you need to upload them to a sharing website such as flickr, dropbox, facebook or many others, and then you can email to birding-aus and provide a web-link to you photos.
Cheers, Steve McBride

Hi All,

Have never shared photos on BirdingAus before so hence 'odd' post!

Regards

Judith
