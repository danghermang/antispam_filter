Vinge's 'Deepness in the Sky' isn't computer-centric, but computers
are such a part _of_ any space-faring culture they're as necessary to
survival as water and air.

Maybe more so - you can always extract water and air from rock but if
you crater all of your automation to fragments you're _really_
screwed.

More to the point 'computers' are everywhere in the text, if not
always called out explicitly.  The main culture even reckons time
using unix epoch.
