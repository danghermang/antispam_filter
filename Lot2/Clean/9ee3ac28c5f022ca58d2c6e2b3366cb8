20m Dipole in Free Space                     11/8/2012 11:32:20 PM

          --------------- SOURCE DATA ---------------

Frequency = 14.16 MHz

Source 1      Voltage = 72.83 V at 0.0 deg.
               Current = 1 A at 0.0 deg.
               Impedance = 72.83 - J 0.0000813 ohms
               Power = 72.83 watts
               SWR (50 ohm system) =  1.457  (74.76 ohm system) = 1.026


Wire OD = 2mm
Total overall length of dipole is 10.2699m
