I like the auction style format where the buyer determines the market price=
 is the only reason I have stuck to eBay thus far.=A0 It used to be a self-=
supporting hobby that has turned into an expensive one, at least for me.

All of these new eBay customer service rules have tied me down making trave=
l nearly impossible.=A0 I wish it was like it was five years ago when you c=
ould sell something on eBay for a fair price, make a reasonable profit and =
travel at the same time.

I cannot stand regulations and eBay has too many new rules that only serve =
to make a seller work twice as hard.

Take Care,

Adam

Adam, I don't know why you have been having problems for last four years (t=
hey have been my best money making years). Perhaps eBay is your problem. I =
have abandoned eBay for the most part, because of rising costs and declinin=
g service and lack of protection for sellers. Sales on eBay collapsed three=
 years ago and I stopped wasting my time there. Once Meg Whitman took over =
and decided that screwing the people who make you money (sellers) as hard a=
s they could was a the good business decision, I told them very impolitely =
exactly what they could go do with themselves every time they called me beg=
ging me to come back and start listing again,=A0 You have to adapt to the n=
ew economy or it will crush you. Perhaps flying more than hundred thousand =
miles a year on meteorite hunts worldwide helps, if I relied on American fa=
lls and finds, I would be bankrupt by now, and if I hunted like NASA and SE=
TI, I would have bankrupted a small state as well.
