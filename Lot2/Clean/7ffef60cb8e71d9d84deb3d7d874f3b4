Subject:[Koha] Changing default focus from keyword to ISBN on staff search
	page
Hi all,

I had a question from my cataloger, whether it was possible to change the f=
ocus of at least one of the buttons on the advanced search page (staff side=
) to=A0 ISBN or barcode.=A0 =


The idea is that one of the buttons will show ISBN when opening the page so=
 it saves her from scrolling down all the time.

I think it is possible, just not sure where to do this, so any help would b=
e appreciated!

Thanks,

Marty
