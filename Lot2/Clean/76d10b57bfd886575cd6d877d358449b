Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Hercules knobs
I was poking around trying to find some more of these for a VE3HG a 1500
users.

For the Canadians who use a Flex unit, you can still find them new at
Canada Computers for $89.
http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=35_660_770&item_id=041144.
 They are in limited supply though.

This makes it cheaper than the Knob with a few more options.
