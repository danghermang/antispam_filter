I apologize for the weird formatting in the previous post.

> FROM THE GOOD MOUNTAIN, HOW GUTENBERG CHANGED THE WORLD, a picture book biography for all
> ages written and illustrated by James Rumford.  

> What could any one person do that could truly change the world? 
> Books!  Gutenberg developed the printing press and in doing so made books,
> reading, and education accessible to many rather than the elite few.  

> In this picture book, written as a series of riddles, questions are asked then
> answered in the classic "call and response" format. 
> Illustrations are done in the style of medieval manuscripts with layers of
> hidden information to discover.  This is a biography to read and re-read
> with pleasure and surprise.
 
>  Book and author will be featured at READERKIDZ NOV 2012   

> James Rumford also has just published a 150-page book to go with his Gutenberg biography about how to make paper.
