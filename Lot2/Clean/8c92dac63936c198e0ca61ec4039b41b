Subject:Re: [Chelsea] CL Group E table
Juve will have to go for the win against us as they'll have no certainty of even a point at Shaktar. That'll leave them more open than they would like and plan to our moderate advantage.

I wouldn't be surprised if they beat both Nordsjaelland away and Juve at home. On the other hand, if they do, we only need one point against Juve, and can afford to lose against Nordsjaelland, in order to finish second in the group. Alternatively, we can lose at Juve and then beat the Danes at home, as long as Shakhtar do their job.
