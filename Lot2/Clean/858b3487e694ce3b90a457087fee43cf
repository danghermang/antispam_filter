Do you have a routine for using all three machines, for different 
functions or?  Since I'm currently wondering how to make two workhorse 
sewing machines with little embroidery capability useful (at times other 
than the hopefully rare periods when one is being serviced), I'd rather 
have a dedicated embroidery machine.

I have no problem with plunging into software. I've done a lot of that 
in writing computer manuals, although a good manual for the embroidery 
software would certainly save me time.  I'd find that far more 
convenient and adaptable to my needs than live classes.

It's quite nasty of people to try to tell you that you should be doing 
all your embroidery by hand, and to force you to give medical excuses.  
Having said that, how well *does* a good embroidery machine imitate 
blackwork?  Are the results fairly plausible as long as it is not under 
the eye of a stitch counter?
