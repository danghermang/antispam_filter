Subject:[EVDL] Anyone near West Palm Beach FL?
Hi gang,

I found a surplus deal on some transformers I'd like to use for battery 
chargers. The company is in West Palm Beach, FL. Unfortunately, the 
company does not like to ship, and wants an outrageous price to ship 
them to Minnesota.

I want to buy 100 transformers for battery chargers. They weigh 2.5 lbs 
each, and are already packed in cardboard boxes. 10 of them fit in a 
USPS Priority Mail large flat rate box. The boxes are free at the post 
office, ten fit neatly per box, and each mails for $15.45. Thus $154.50 
to ship. But they want $262 to ship them!

Is there anyone close that would be willing to pick them up and ship 
them to me? Include something for what your time is worth, and email me 
off-list. Thanks!
