Yes, both kubuntu and Mint KDE are possibles, having used both in the past.

That sounds good. I suppose it is a matter of luck really whether you
get a drive that just works or one that has problems. Hence the variety
of review results.

Thanks for the info. I now remember what a SSD is about. It seems to me
that that would be more useful for someone who wanted to use it all the
time. I am mainly looking for somewhere to store my current /home
folders and files. Then, once I have installed the new distro I will be
able to copy whatever I want from the external drive to the new /home
partition.

Then the external HD would be used occasionally for backup. I have my
own web site so at the moment really critical files are stored there as
backup, but that is only a few files. An external HD could store many
more files more easily and quickly.

Yes, I do have some old internal hard disks around somewhere. I must see
if I can find them! We are talking desktop here so 3.5 inch is the way
to go. These hard disks are quite old mind, so I suspect they will be
IDE. If so I may decide not to bother with this old technology.

Neil
