Subject:[CT Birds] Late Ovenbird, Norwalk yard

I was away for the weekend and surprised upon returning home today to find a new bird for the yard- an Ovenbird.  Unfortunately, it was not alive- appears to have been a window-strike.  I note it here because it would seem to be a late date for the species- given its condition, "late" has a double-meaning.
