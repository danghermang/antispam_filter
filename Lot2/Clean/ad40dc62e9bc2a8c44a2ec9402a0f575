Subject:Re: [burners] Creatures of The Night this Friday!
What is the general consensus regarding promoting classes, events, etc on
this list?

Is it on topic?  Not?

I personally don't have any issues with it, but I've been chastised in the
past about it, and I know other groups with good intentions are terrified
to promote on this list.
