Subject:[arin-announce] ARIN PDP Consultation Now Closed
On 30 November 2012, ARIN concluded its consultation with the community
with regards to the Revised Policy Development Process (PDP) for policy
development in the ARIN region.

https://www.arin.net/participate/acsp/community_consult/10-29-2012_revised_pdp.html

The ARIN Board of Trustees will review the feedback received at their
upcoming meeting in December, after which
we will report back to the community on the next steps in the PDP
revision process.

ARIN thanks everyone who contributed to this consultation, as it relies
heavily on clear direction received through community input.

Regards,

Communications and Member Services
American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN)
