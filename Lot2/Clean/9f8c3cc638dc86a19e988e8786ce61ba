Subject:[Dixielandjazz] Simple vs difficult tunes
Listening to music is mostly for enjoyment.  I try not to analyse what I'm
hearing in order to fully allow for the enjoyment.  Any discerning listener
will, however, even if after the listening event do some analysis,
especially
when something about it remained in memory.

Not having any credentials other than many hours of listening to many
different forms and styles of music, I have concluded that whether old
or modern jazz forms, or bluegrass, or whatever-----one thing that is
common to the "really good"  musical groups is the ability to make a
very simple melody and chord structure into a work of art.  Of course,
that really good group also does the same with a "difficult" tune.

Top tier musicians can make any tune sound good!

                        a tune sound "good'
