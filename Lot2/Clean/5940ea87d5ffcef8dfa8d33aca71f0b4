Agreed.

To be clear, the proposed fee schedule has legacy address holders (who 
have opted to enter an LRSA with ARIN) paying the same fees as end-users.  
Some earlier versions of the LRSA cap any increase in fees to $25/year, 
and for those cases the fees billed will increase by $25 each year until 
fee billed matches an end-user with the same quantity of number resources.

ARIN has consistently provided basic registry services for all resource 
holders in the region, including legacy address block holders without 
charge, and the proposed revision to the fee schedule would not not alter
this practice.
