Hm. I don't particularly agree with their pitch... For example, over 20 
years ago I was working with a company building what we now know as 
clusters.. It's not a new concept. Biggest one I helped build at the time: 
http://unicorn.drogon.net/cs2.gif That had 256 compute boards each with a 
dual processor sparc and 128MB of RAM...

https://projects.drogon.net/a-box-of-200-raspberry-pis/

10 years ago I worked with a company who developed a general purpose 
plug-in pci/pcie card - 96 cores on it - under 10 watts a chip (they put 2 
on a single plug-in card) see http://www.clearspeed.com/

So the concept isn't new. Making it affordable and "open" is...

The problem then and now still is: How do you program the things? The 
question we were always asked went along the lines of: I have this 30 year 
old FORTRAN program - make it go faster with more data ...

Want to play with multi-cores on a chip today? Buy one of these:
