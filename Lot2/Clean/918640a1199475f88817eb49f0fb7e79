Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] A Murmuration of Starlings
Hi Jim & others,
In Nov 2008, at Chilli Beach, (Iron Range) Qld, we sat on the beach and
watched wheeling flocks of Metallic Starlings coming in to roost for the
night on a small island just offshore. Not in the millions, but still
spectacular to see. I have no idea if it's seasonal, or if they still come
to the same location.
I've just uploaded a video to YouTube, link below. Taken with an old compact
digital still camera, in fading evening light, so original quality was poor,
& there seems to further loss of quality when uploading.

Subject: [Birding-Aus] A Murmuration of Starlings

Hello Birding-Aus people,

One of the most wondrous sights in nature is watching a very large flock (a
murmuration) of starlings wheeling around in continuously variable pattern
at dusk in late autumn.

Some photos of this can be seen in today's Guardian:

Video of the phenomenon obtained by entering "Starling Murmuration" into
Google. The largest murmuration claimed is for a flock of 2 million birds in
Denmark.

I have seen this wonderful sight in England and France. I have a
recollection of seeing in the distance somewhere near Mudgee NSW a wheeling
flock of starlings. That was about half a century ago when I was a uni
student.

Can anybody on Birding-Aus tell me if there are places in Australia where
one can still see a murmuration of Starlings?

Cheers,
