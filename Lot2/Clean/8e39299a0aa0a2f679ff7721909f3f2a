Subject: [CT Birds] Question

This morning at the West Haven boat launch I observed an immature Herring Gull with both a regular band and a green band with a white code on it. I know where to report tagged gulls, but does anyone know where to report banded gulls? Any info would be much appreciated. Thank you.
