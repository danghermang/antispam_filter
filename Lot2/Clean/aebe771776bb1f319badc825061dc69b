Mmmmm Voodoo Donughts (anywhere that has a doughnut called the "old dirty bastard" HAS to be a win!) and the food carts are EPIC!!! If you need somewhere to stay for a night or have people visiting, the ACE hotel is great. 

I only spent a little time there running a program at PSU but it's a WICKED town and I can't wait to go back!

Oh, also I had a VERY good meal at the Urban Farmer, not cheap, but SERIOUSLY yummy! 

Enjoy!
