Subject:[Flexradio] Changing TX frequency while transmitting on FLEX-1500
While testing my FLEX-1500 driving a DEMI L432-28HP transverter on CW, I noticed the transmit frequency did not change while transmitting, even though VFO A was being changed through CAT commands. PowerSDR v2.4.4 was being controlled by SatPC32 via CAT and the frequency was changing due to changing Doppler shift of a amateur satellite. The FLEX-1500 was driving a 432 MHz transverter using the XVTR table in PowerSDR.

As long as the key was down, the frequency transmitted did not change even though VFO A changed. If the transmitter was un-keyed momentarily, the transmitted frequency changed to the new VFO A frequency, but held steady as long as the key was held down even though VFO A continued to change.

Am I missing something that is keeping the frequency from changing?
