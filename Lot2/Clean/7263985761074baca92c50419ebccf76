Subject:[burners]  Montreal Decompression is 11/3!
http://taburnak.org/Welcome.html

taBURNak IV is drawing nigh! On November 3, the playa come to Montreal for
a night of art, music, celebration, life, and love.I know it's over a 5
hour drive from Boston to Montreal. Consider this, though: It's over a 6
hour drive from Toronto, and a large swath of the Toronto community makes
it to taBURNak. It's well, well worth the commute.

This'll be my 3rd year going and I'd love to see the Boston crew
represented. Our communities can only benefit from cross-pollination.

It's less than 2 weeks away, so if there's art you want to bring or duties
you want to volunteer for, go to the site and make your voice heard!

Toodle pip,
