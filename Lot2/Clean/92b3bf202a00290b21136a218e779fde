Dear  friends,

For this once, I'd like to momentarily suspend the child_lit  canon of
adhering to children's literature in our discussions to send  felicitations to
child_lit mainstay and author of "Richie's Picks," Richie  Partington, on his
recent nuptials. Warm regards, Richie, and best of luck to  you!


Best,
Michael
