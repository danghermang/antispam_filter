Subject:[burners] Big fire festivals


The Home Page for AOL email has a Huffington Post story about the world's top ten fire festivals.


Most are outside the US, but there's an enormous one in Florida that attracts 500 people.  
Five hundred!  That's HUGE!  Probably dangerous and borderline illegal ...
They probably have Cheetos and Goldfish, like Colorado.


I found it here:
