Thanks, Clements. 

Your link motivated me to search again for the document. Turns out it wasn't HP at all but Agilent, and I found a surviving copy at

https://hiseasnet.ucsd.edu/wiki/download/attachments/458795/agl_spec_analyzer_basics.pdf

I still say it's great writing. Page 2 includes the following note: "Agilent Technologies Signal Analysis Division would like to acknowledge the author, Blake Peterson, for more than 40 years of outstanding service in engineering applications and technical education for Agilent and our customers."
