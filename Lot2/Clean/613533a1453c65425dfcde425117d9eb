Subject:[burners] Looking to borrow/buy speakers for Ecstatic Dance
	Providence
Hey Burner Community ~

A few of you fine folks know me although I'm not too vocal on this list. I am currently producing a once a month Ecstatic Dance event down in PVD that is slowly gathering momentum (it's sure not the Bay Area here!). I have collected most of the materials and equipment to make it happen and even started dj'ing it myself aside from hiring dj's from both Boston and NYC from time to time... but I have yet to invest in a good pair of speakers due to the high cost. I usually borrow from a good (and very generous) friend. Of course this next dance on Nov. 9th he is unable to provide so I am asking if anyone out there has a pair of decent speakers and stands I could borrow OR if anyone has a pair to sell for a decent price. I do all of this mostly by myself as helpers tend to come and go like leaves on the wind so please know this is an urgent cry for help. Thanks in advance for ANY leads toward my goal!
