Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Metropolitan Police drop Mark Clattenburg probe
	due	to lack of evidence [Sky]
The Prosecutor for London said:  "The decision to charge Mr Terry was taken after police received a complaint from a member of the public."

I don't think she'd describe Ferdinand as a member of the public.

Does it matter whether the nark saw it live on TV or on YouTube?

On TV? Or after viewing a youtube video entitled "Terry call Anton Ferdinand a FBC" hours after the event? He didn't make the video AFAIAA. Or did he?
