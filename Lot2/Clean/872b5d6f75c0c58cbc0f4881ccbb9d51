Subject:[Chelsea] R Ferdinand and hypocrisy
Is this ever going to get commented on?  Or are the Ferdinand brothers now entrenched as eternal victims, despite their individual questionable histories?  And is anyone ever going to notice or mention the incongruence of R Ferdinand's belief that A Cole should have either tailored his evidence on the basis of skin colour, and in so doing perjured himself, or not spoken what he believed as true at all?  Is that not racist?

And tell me why J Terry is eternally cast as the philanderer when an apology was issued to V Peroncel after her denial of any liaison with said Terry?  And why the admitted serial philandering of Messers Ferdinand and Giggs, with his sister-in-law of all people, is quietly brushed under the carpet?
I can understand rival supporters taking prejudiced views based on team allegiances. But you are journalists plying a trade that should be aligned to the notion of investigation of facts.  And collectively, you and your peers are getting ever lazier.

For some objective journalism, I know that will be an odd concept given the prejudice surrounding J Terry, have a read of this http://huff.to/RrSOXL.

Kind regards, and good luck with the bile.
