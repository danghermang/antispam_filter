Subject:[MG] International E-Democracy Talk
Then let's move on to the more fun aspect of this administrivia (and back to marc's original question)... what should the next topic be. Or more broadly, what should the theme of these meetings be?

Suggestions? If we have numerous suggestions, then we can formalize the selection process, but for the moment, please speak up if you have an idea for anything that would be of interest to the community of people working on our various democracy projects. Guest lecturers; topic debates, addressing cross-project problems, collaborating on outreach, organizing a cross-project funding mechanism... what do you think?


P.S. If it hasn't been evident, my participation has been rather low as there have been several heavy demands on my time. I will do what I can to facilitate these meetings, but would certainly appreciate any help anyone would like to volunteer.
