Subject:Re: [child_lit] middle school novels about hunger and emotional
	hunger
I am shy to suggest my own recent late-middle-grade book, which came out last month. But while it does not treat hunger as a main subject, children's physical and emotional hunger play a large role; and the villain also has distorted ideas about eating and hunger. The book is called SUMMER AND BIRD, and you can see more about (with links to its Kirkus, Booklist, and other reviews) here:
