I agree with Jason, it doesn't look quite right.

It's always hard to tell from photos, but if it looked this way in person, =
I would not have guessed Holbook.=A0 If someone cleans/shines them up, it c=
an really change the look of them.

I've found a lot Holbrook and seen a lot taken in the field, and I thought =
I knew them well.=A0 But I was surprised a few years ago at the difference,=
 when I saw one cleaned with chapstick just hours after being found in fron=
t of many witnesses.=A0 I had to adjust my thinking (I've always left mine =
as found, dirt and all, and I'm glad I have).

But even so, that doesn't really change the thickness of the crust.=A0 It j=
ust looks strange - it could be a Holbrook that's been handled a lot, like =
being carried in a pocket (???).

Unless you really trust this person, I'd stay away, but that's just me (the=
 seller could be on the up and up).

Mark

P.S nice finds Jim!

Hello Jim,
I see finely textured crust with surface rust.=A0 Looks like a Holbrook.
I think the lighting of the photo on facebook is throwing you off.
It's quite different.

Jason
