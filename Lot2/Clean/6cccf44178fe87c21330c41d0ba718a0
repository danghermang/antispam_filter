Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Heads up on Astron Power supplies
Speaking of Astron power supplies, I've noticed on several of my RS- and
VS- 35A and 50A supplies that they occasionally emit a low frequency
vibration that can easily progagate through wooden shelves and tabletops.
Their rubberized feet seem to do little to stop it. It came to light when
operating AM with a desk microphone and contacts noticed a slight rumble
on the audio. A rubberized mouse pad from the previous century now sits
under the mike stand whenever I use a desk mike.
