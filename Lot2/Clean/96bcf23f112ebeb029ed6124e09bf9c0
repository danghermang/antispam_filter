I did some occam work on their PC simulator. Once I walked down a 
corridor and found, next to four lifts and no humans, a large black 
filing cabinet thingy with 1024 transputers in it - a computing surface 
I think they called it. Probably one the first ever built.
Just sitting there with no-one around.
When I read how Zaphod felt about just having to steal the heart of gold 
a few years later I knew exactly how he felt but without the built in 
getaway vehicle. I think I spent a good 10 minutes going through the 
possibilities before carrying on as normal.
