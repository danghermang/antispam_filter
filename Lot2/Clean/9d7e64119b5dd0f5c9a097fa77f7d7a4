Subject:Re: [EVDL] Elcon PFC 1500 Died
You missed the point, the larger chargers allow you to charge at a Level 2 or
Level 1 charger. It would be rude for a EV to take up a long time at a
public charger using 110vac and maybe 6amp. I can tell you don't use the
public chargers, cause this is a real problem and it still boils down to
money. Look at the production cars and try to follow their example. If not,
the resale value of your EV will be in the toilet. Look at the garbage on
ebay and you can see what I am talking about. This brings up another point,
at the recent Plug-in-America event in Cupertino I was appalled at the cars
that were there being driven by all those on the forums claiming knowledge
of conversions. Charging cords of 12ga dragging on the ground, etc. I have
never seen such sloppy work, yet those same people are all over the forums
miss leading those that really need help and don't know what they are doing.
I wont mention names as they know who I am talking about. This in not only
my opinion, but is shared by most all the students I have had for over 5
years.
