Subject:[Birding-Aus] November images
Hi all,

Just uploaded a few more images from the last couple of weeks. I was lucky
to get a couple of frames of Scarlet Honeyeater at the You Yangs last week =
=AD
this species has definitely expanded its range over recent years. It was a
rare bird near Melbourne only fairly recently.

www.gregoakleywildpix.com =AD then go to Recent, and November,

Cheers,
Greg
