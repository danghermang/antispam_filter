Tim,

I agree wholeheartedly.  Unfortunately he selected "Reply to All" instead of
"Reply" when he sent me the message.

As per Reflector subscriber's requests, please send bug reports for
third-party applications directly to the author of the application and not
to the FlexRadio Reflector.  Thank you.
