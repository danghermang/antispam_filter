Subject:Re: [CT Birds] Acorns
I'd say we have a "middling" amount of acorns in Chester. More than before last winter (when we got very little snow), but definitely not as many as we got previous to the "snowpocalypse" winter. It still seems to be a bit under average, though. Thankfully, our dogwoods and other fruit-bearing bushes are pushing out a lot of berries, which they didn't do at all last fall.
I find it interesting that the trees seem to have turned and dropped their leaves sooner than normal. Perhaps "remembering" the storm at the end of last October...?

Our property is surrounded by oaks and we've had hardly any acorns for thepast two years. The squirrels are already desperate for food - at my homeand many of my customers' homes. It will be a rough winter for animals.Margaret Robbins-- Wild Birds Unlimited317 Federal Rd.
