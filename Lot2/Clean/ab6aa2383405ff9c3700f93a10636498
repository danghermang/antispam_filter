Quoting from John Kraus' ANTENNAS..., 3rd Edition, page 182 with respect to 
his calculation of 73 +j 42.5 ohms shown there for the (free space) terminal 
impedance of a thin, linear, center-fed, 1/2WL dipole, he goes on to state:

"To make the reactance zero, that is, to make the antenna resonant, requires 
that the antenna be shortened a few percent less than 1/2WL.  This 
shortening also results in a reduction in the value of radiation resistance 
to about 65 ohms."
