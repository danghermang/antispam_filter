the marsh, take the public access path on the left, or south, of the=A0
chain-link fence at the plant. After a short walk and after a white pipe,=

take the much narrower path to the marsh on your left. Once at the marsh,=

walk right along the marsh edge for about 50 yards. The bird is in and=A0
around the pools of water in the corner.

To reach the NE corner of Marsh Meadows, park at the water treatment plant.=
=A0
Walk across North Road and face east. You'll see a path along the edge of=
=A0
the marsh (It's the north edge of the marsh). Travel that path east for=A0
about 5-10 minutes..You'll see low pools of water. Start checking there. Th=
