Subject:Re: [child_lit] Libraries damaged by Sandy?
So great of you to do this, Sarah.

I will contact my publisher and see if they can send some MG and YA books
your way. I know they publish a fair amount of them, including mine. They
sent books to help support a flooded library a while back.

I hope all of our authors here can do the same.
