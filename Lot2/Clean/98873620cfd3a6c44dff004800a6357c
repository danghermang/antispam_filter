Subject:Re: [Dixielandjazz] G`day !!!!
Lots of music and lots of Sport  here in The States going on as we
wrap up the season (just as you are starting yours!)  I had 2 gigs, a
100 year plus traditional college football match and an important
baseball playoff game going on within 24 hours or so... not much time
to spend on the computer.
