Subject:(on-u) The Reverend T.A.C.K.
In all these years of loving that song, how come I've never ever heard 
anything of this full-length Reverend business?  Where has it been buried?  
Or is it newly recorded vocals from Sharehead times?  (Not easy to tell 
from the preview quality of the MP3 and my crappy little speakers here!).
