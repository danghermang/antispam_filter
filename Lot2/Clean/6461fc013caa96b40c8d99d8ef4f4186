We're still working on it, though progress has been slow due to lack of 
income. As you can see from the website <www.sunrise-ev.com>, I'm trying 
to offer small things for sale to get some cash flow.

On the body: The last big hurdle is to figure out what we're going to do 
with the headlights. Then we're ready to make a mold from the prototype 
body, so we can make production bodies to sell. For now, we simply 
filled in the headlight "buckets" to make the body easier to mold. The 
headlight openings will then need to be cut out, a clear lexan cover 
fitted to the opening, and a separate fiberglass "bucket" made to go 
inside the fender to support whatever headlight assembly is chosen.
