Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] OT- Hurricane Sandy
Thank you Mike and Darryl !

I got a private email with a link to the radar maps around NY (or 
elsewhere):
www.wunderground.com/wundermap/

Radar maps are the best (I feel) to follow rain/storm/hurricane paths.
This is the link I used last year for Irene and it did really help to see 
the real path
almost live...

Thank you Mike for your emergency and safety "tool kit" !

It seems that hurricanes have a tendency, lately, to hit NY state, Vermont 
and up North !
Something which didn't happen for many years.
I have the increasing feeling that a real real big one might hurt that 
region...

Thank you everyone
Stay safe and sound

Michael B.
