Subject:Re: [EVDL] Ceramic Heater elements




A few years ago, I ran across an Emerson ceramic heater that had two 750 watt elements instead of the typical single 1500 watt element. 

Perfect for my intended use. 

My 1966 Corvair has 3000 watts (2 typical units) of elements for cabin heat and that works nicely even in the coldest temps that a Minnesota winter can dish out. 
But, sometimes I just wanted to have a robust defroster without cranking out a lot of heat. (Like when my Chocolate Lab is on "squirrel patrol" and has his nose plastered to the inside of the windshield)

These little units fit the bill. They measure 1 3/4 inches wide by 4 3/8 inches long. (Including connector tabs) 

The old Corvair has a steel dashboard, so fabricating  a couple of boxes to hold the elements and fans under the existing louvers was pretty easy. 

The defrost works well, but the dog slobber on the windshield is a different story. 

Anyway . . . these heaters came in a "two pack", so I have a couple of extra 750 watt elements. I'd be willing to sell them to you for my cost.

Contact me off list at medeck1@msn.com if you're interested.
