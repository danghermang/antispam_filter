Hi All,
Just got off the phone with Vern Tisdale. He's been in the hospital/recover=
y home, for the last 4 weeks.=A0 He is much better now--but still has a "la=
rge hole" in his foot. This was caused by (an unlicensed ? woman) shopping =
cart driver, who plowed into his foot at the grocery store.=20
He asked me to thank all that have given him "moral support"--and to tell y=
ou that he is not able to receive any of the voice mail left on his phone.=
=A0 I also spoke to his son Jayson, and he assures me that he is attempting=
 to catch up on all of the past orders sent via email, or snail mail--but o=
nce again--the phone will not co-operate with any voice mails---so please, =
if you ordered via the phone, try again, and do not leave a message as he c=
an not hear it--
Ron Rich=20
