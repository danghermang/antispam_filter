Subject:[Birding-Aus] Expedition to Werribee WTP
G'day Birding Aus,

Due to some confusion on my behalf, I'm going to be in Melbourne this
Saturday (10th of Nov) with the whole day free.  I was wondering if anybody
with a pass would be interested and able to take me on a birding trip to
the Werribee WTP?  I'm staying in Brunswick but happy to catch public
transport to anywhere that would be convenient.

Regards,

Jeremy O'Wheel
