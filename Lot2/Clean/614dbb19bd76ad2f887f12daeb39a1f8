Subject:[EVDL] New battery fuse
Hi all,

While ordering from one of my favorite suppliers (www.waytekwire.com), I 
noticed that they had a new type of battery fuse listed -- the Bussman 
MRBF series.

http://www.lico.hu/bussmann/Marine_Batteriesicherungen.pdf

They come in 90a to 200a sizes, and are rated for up to 58vdc, with a 
10,000 amp interrupting capacity. Marine rated; waterproof and 
acidproof, to mount right on top of a battery. Cost is about $5.

The package is interesting. It is a rectangular block with a hole in the 
middle, like a thick washer. If your battery has a stud, you place the 
fuse on the stud, place your ring terminal on top of the fuse, and put 
the nut on top. The nut needs to be insulated from the stud, so current 
passes from the battery terminal, through the fuse, and out the ring 
terminal (and not directly through the stud). They have insulated nuts 
and/or washers to allow this.

Has anyone seen or used these fuses yet?
