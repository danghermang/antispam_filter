Please explain. In what way do RIR policies not support openness or =

This has nothing to do with openness or RIR policies. I think you're =
mistaken too.

First off, it's IP addresses, not "IPs". Second, current policy says =
LIRs are supposed to return unused resources to their RIR when they no =
longer need/use them. Can you provide an example  where an RIR has =
reclaimed unused addresses from an LIR? [Some address space has of =
course been recovered by the RIRs and IANA. However to the best of my =
knowledge that's pretty much been unused legacy space that had been =
given to organisations that no longer exist.] An RIR has no way of =
knowing definitively if an LIR is using its address space or not unless =
the LIR confirms that. Finally, whatever action an RIR takes over an =
LIR's unused address space is decided by RIR policy, not whether those =
addresses "have value". For some definition of "have value". AFAICT =
nobody's suggesting a policy change so RIRs can reclaim addresses (and =
re-sell them?) now that a market in v4 space is emerging.

Now whether an LIR will hand back its unused space or not is an entirely =
different matter from RIR policy or its openness. Perhaps those LIRs =
will want to trade their unused space. Perhaps not. That's largely a =
matter for them and their consciences.
