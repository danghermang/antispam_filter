Subject:Re: [ARIN-consult] [arin-announce] Fee Schedule Change Consultation
I think you may have misread my response to brian as being from brian.


Our tax system actually works the opposite way as I pointed out in a
previous email. The top 5% pay more than half the total income taxes
collected in the US. But I'm not sure how relevant that is here as we're
discussing fees rather than taxes. Fees I think should be more directly
related to resources consumed.

Brian, it is disproportionate.

My bill is doubling.   I've sent several emails to Arin and have yet to
receive a response other than, "is your org id this?".

The lack of response is a bit disconcerting to say the least.

Sounds a lot like the way our tax system works there Brian!

I cannot say I am pleased with the proposed fee schedule.  If not for the
comic books and special election logos, conference and other elaborate and
excessive and wasteful spending I'd say I would normally not disagree with
logic.   Do I really need 3 snail mail letters to remind me to vote?

However, I keep a copy of that comic on my desk to remind myself why
there's a fee increase.

I apologize for the cynicism and mean no disrespect.  But I think Brian
makes a valid point here that his being overlooked.

I've read through the PDF that describes the revenue in over the years,
but have yet to see anything that shows the revenue out.  I realize we're
all thinking about the future down the road as it concerns the fee
schedule and realize that at some point the revenue stream will level off.
As it stands now, its still growing.  I'd be more concerned with cutting
waste as a form of generating more revenue than boosting the fee schedule
on one particular group.

As I understand it there are less than 500 or so of us that are seeing the
increase. I just wonder how many others are middle of the road/border line
like us?  We're just over the threshold and will have a doubling of our
fees as a result.  I suppose if I did not have to make an annual payment
it might be easier to mitigate the expense out of cash flow.  The lump sum
and a doubling in these tough economic times is not going to be easy.
