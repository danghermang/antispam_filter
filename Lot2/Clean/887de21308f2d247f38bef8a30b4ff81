For what it's worth, I agree fully, and I've already prepared a proposal
that does exactly this. It's awaiting review by the WG chairs before
being formally submitted. If you or anyone else would like to (p)review
it to see if it is in a shape you could support, or even help co-author
it, that would be much appreciated.

Partially to this end, my proposal also takes the opportunity to clean
up the last /8 policy - making it "the everything policy" - by merging
it into or replacing the main policy sections.

(It does not seek to actually change the mechanics of the last /8 policy
though, only to do some cosmetic reconstructive surgery. This means the
two "last /16" reservations for IXPs and unforeseen circumstances remain.)
