Subject:[LUG] Qubes
Security seems to be a big topic.

Noted this month that Qubes is on a couple of magazines covers.

It look interesting, anyone had a play?

The idea seems simple enough, but I guess the question is how well it is
executed.

Only PC I have meeting minimum spec is busy being my work desktop, so
taking time out to experiment with novel desktop distros is not going to
win any favours with my boss.
