Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Wurlitzer 1500 and 1550 decal set
I know many people who tried and failed to get any of the 1500 series
models working properly. I had one about 30 years ago and couldn't get it
running at all so I sold it someone who I think never got it to work either.
Fast forward to Dec. 2009 and a lady who lives in my town contacted me that
she had an old jukebox -- it was the W1500A -- the same model I had 30
years prior -- but not the same machine. She asked me if I'd like to see it
work and I looked at her as if "huh?" -- this machine works? Well, it did
and didn't -- but I was about 100% ahead of where I was 30 years before so
I bought it from her. Moving it was another story but it got here intact.
She told me the machine had been in  her family since 1959 when her father
bought it from an Operator, so the machine was 6 years old back then. It
had been in her family ever since -- 50 years! When I took it out of her
home she cried like a baby but when it was restored she was thrilled that
it was getting a new lease on life.

I received emails from jukeaholics from all over the world advising me not
to tackle it as it was a nightmare to work on -- but I was not going to be
snake-bit twice on this model, so I decided I was going to restore it even
if it killed me -- and it almost did. The sound system was complex and was
expensive to restore but we ripped everything out of the amp except the
power transformer and replaced it with all new parts and brand new NOS
American tubes. Worth it, believe me. The mechanism is very complex and the
2mil stylus is difficult to adjust for both 78 and 45rpm records to track
effectively. The side B's seem to track lighter than the A sides so we have
to try to make adjustments for that. The manual is useless for
troubleshooting and making fine adjustments so you have to be patient but
it wears thin after awhile and you have to walk away from it and come back
to it later with fresh eyes or it will drive you insane.

I have 4 segments on You Tube and in segment #4 I show the 1500A playing
"Young Blood" by The Coasters on a side B 78rpm so you can see the machine
reverse the motor and play the record upside down, spinning
counterclockwise -- fascinating to watch.

As an FYI, "YoungBlood" was initially supposed to be the side A hit but the
side B "Searchin'" became the hit
instead. Prior to 1955, the Coasters were called "The Robins" and recorded
the fabulous "Riot in cell block #9"
in 1954. I have it on 78rpm and it is a sensational piece of work..  Thanks
for your response.
