Subject:[Hsqldb-user] Re g:Optimizing and increasing my performance in
 hsqldb

Hi,
I am having a scenario where I run a  server and many clients. Each client
connects to server.
I am trying to use hsqldb with Mapreduce job, For that I am using hsqldb as
a server. My MR jobs does the query on server and fetch one row from their.
For this I am using single connection. At any given point of time the MR job
can ask 30-50 k rows. Currently I am trying to do this and it is giving me
very low performance. It is fetching 3000 records in 3 mins, which is very
slow. I need 100 rows per seconds. Please suggest me to tune my settings
accordingly
