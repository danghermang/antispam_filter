Subject:[CT Birds] Peregrines and siskins - Newington, 10/24/12
10/24/12, Newington
2 large falcons overhead, one noticeably larger than the other, I am
assuming a male and female peregrines, vocalizing and playing/arguing while
headed north to south at about 6PM.

~25 pine siskins on feeders this morning.  The 2 I saw yesterday must have
invited some friends.

My feeders are full and awaiting the flocks of Evening Grosbeaks and
redpolls. :)
