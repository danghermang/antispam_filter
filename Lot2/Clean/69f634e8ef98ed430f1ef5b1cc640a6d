Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Alan,

As to the particular question that you asked in your email, this was the 
topic of my tech note
http://puhep1.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/power.pdf
which I mentioned during the recent thread, rather than repeating it in 
detail.

I agree that it is good to be aware of such things when thinking about 
receiving antennas.

PS  As also mentioned before, I updated that note with brief mention of 
ferrite loop antennas in footnote 3, and I added footnote 5 about the 
(simple) quantum view of capture area.

Kirk and all

What I am trying to say is that there is a good step forward in
knowledge of small antennas to be had by addressing the question I put
a good few days ago, but no-one has looked up from the pit to address
it.  I feel that may be because we may be in danger of deserting
intelligence and becoming another internet shouting shop :)  But it
hasn't happened just yet . . . so here is the question with some more
hints:

The equivalent circuit for a small receive antenna is a voltage
generator in series with a radiation resistance, a loss resistance,
and a reactance.  That leads us to these questions:

1. The exact formula for the capture area of any small antenna,
ignoring loss resistance and reactance, is 3.lambda^2 / 8.pi,

2. hence or otherwise, find out the formula relating the open-circuit
output voltage (for a given field strength) to the radiation
resistance,

3. does this provide a useful check on formulas for output voltage and
radiation resistance encountered in the literature?

Keen students could check the answers for a small dipole, a small
loop; and a ferrite rod antenna using whatever formulas are quoted in
the literature.

More hints:

Use the formula for the capture area of a small antenna (above) and
equate it to the formula for the available power as given by circuit
theory (temporarily ignoring losses):

1. Available power = capture area times power density of the incident field:
Pav =  3 lambda^2 / (8.pi)  *  E^2 / eta0   where eta0 is the
free-space wave impedance.

2. Available power is also given in terms of open-circuit voltage and
radiation resistance:
Pav = V^2/(4.Rr)

This links the radiation resistance to the open-circuit voltage for
any small antenna.  In the equations E is the incident field and V the
open-circuit voltage (rms values).

Don't write that ferrite rod antennas are highly lossy, it's already
common knowledge, but understanding theory requires a degree of
abstract thought on the way to understanding, and losses can be dealt
with later.
