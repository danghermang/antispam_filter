Rush,
Most inverters simply shut off when the input
falls to 10.5V, they have no idea of slope.
They also do not turn on again until the input
goes above about 12.5V so they do not hiccup
but only restore output after some charging has occurred.
With a 300W lamp a 12V inverter will draw approx 30A so
if the clock shows (after inverter shutting off) that it
has run 1/2 hour, then the battery has delivered approx
15Ah at a load of approx 30A.

The problem with the lawn mower is likely the same that
I had in my pack - some stinker cells due to a few too
deep discharges, causing reversal of the weakest cells
that causes them to have very small capacity and act
like resistors as soon as their small capacity is used.
If the bad (or all) batteries are exchanged with a good
pack, the mower should again run the full hour again.
But it is good to check and measure to find any failures
or too high consumption in other areas, before spending
the money replacing the pack and finding that it still
runs 1/2 hour because the batteries were not the problem
after all.

Let me see if I understand the above in my terms -  I have a discharger,
it
is a 300wt lamp, I start discharging at' StDisChrgV' (voltage at start
of
Discharge) and end discharging at 'EndDisChgV' (voltage at end of
Discharge)
and I know the 'DisChgT' (Discharge Time). The discharge stops because
'SlopeDifMax' has been reached (voltage sampling has determined that the
rate or slope of discharge is too fast and a weak cell reversal may
occur or
the voltage is dropping abnormally fast).

pack/battery?
