I find ice'd EV spots all the time, most often when the host does not
pay for proper signage, as in the case of Kohl's Dept. Store where there
is usually next to no signage. Last week I found newly installed EVSE
for one of our local Dreamworks sites. They only put some small white
lettered wording on the asphalt, with no 'in-your-face' signage at all.

There is no consistency on EV signage, and usually it is what the EVSE
company that won the bid throws in. But that the EV signage they put in
is usually only cutesy and not aggressive enough to get the message
across that offending vehicles can be tow away at owners expense ($500 +
time wasted to get your car back - been there, done that).

Take a look at a search on  electric vehicle signage
http://google.com/search?hl=en&q=electric+vehicle+signage&um=1&tbm=isch&source=og

EV signage near me is ridiculously laid-back/does not shout stay-out

Or it is where people do not look, way down low on the asphalt

Or way up high on a too high pole (only good for semi-trucks)

When what is needed is a sign that is in the face of the obstinate ice
driver (at about the 5ft height)

There are California laws to have offenders towed away

Washington State has theirs too

IMO all EV signage should be as aggressive as this one

Car sharing companies like Zip-car have no bones about making it clear
that no one is to mess with their profitable business

So why should EV installations be coy?

...
Leaving nasty notes or being nasty to people obviously blocking access
is not right as it does more harm that good. Drivers not
code-enforcement personnel, we do not have the right to play
parking-cop. I find letting them know that "non-plug-in cars will be
towed and that it cost 'me' $500 to get mine back, so be careful (not to
park in those spots)", is more of a friend helping a friend know
something (nothing to tick the offender off and get shot over).

...
A couple of weeks ago on my routine tour of my local EVSE, one site had
four spaces but on three could be used as one was labeled as disabled.
There were two Leaf EVs plugged into each of the j1772 EVSE, and the
last space had a Volt pih that was not plugged in. The Volt pih could
have been connected to a level-1 as two were available.

One of the Leaf EVs was charging, while the other was done. There was no
signage stating a time limit, that a plug-in had to move out of the
space once the charge had completed, if it was not plugged in, nor any
tow-away signage.

But those that have long memories will remember, the law that GM plied
its sizable lobbying abilities on California legislators to force
through a convoluted law that makes it illegal for a plug-in to park in
a EV space without being plugged in or if it is already charged. 

Good thing my local parking control person hasn't a clue about the GM
law, nor has the desire to spend time enforcing it as they are not
measured on EV laws, so they do not care ... (do not blame them, they
are only working the City Gov. System to keep the lousy job they have).
