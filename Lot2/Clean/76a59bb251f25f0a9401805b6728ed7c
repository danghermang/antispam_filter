Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] NASA/SETI missed opportunity + OT: tax strategy
My take on taxes:

I take every legal advantage to avoid paying taxes that I can.
I feel that's every Americans responsibility to do so.

In regards to small business...hobby business, the IRS has some real good
information available as to what is writeable or not.  It is perfectly
acceptable to
write off mileage, office equipment and supplies as well as home office space.

All of this sort of stuff applies to hunter/dealers that are in the
hobby business of selling
meteorites.

Where the red flags begin to appear is when  said business is writing
off more than they make.

Don't be intimidate by an audit.  Be there, done that.  If you are
honest, there are no worries!

Also fyi....  while  we all pay intra state tax, inter state tax is
tightening up.  Legally, if you sell and
ship something out of state, you are liable for the tax.  Most do not
pay this, but it's on the books in many
states...AZ being one of them.
