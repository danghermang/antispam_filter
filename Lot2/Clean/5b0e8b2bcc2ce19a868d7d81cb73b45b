Subject:[Coral-List] reef rotifers
Dear colleagues,

We are working with sponge associated fauna from northeastern Brazilian
reefal systems. At this moment, our focus relies on marine rotifers. The
group remains largely unexplored along Southwestern Atlantic - a few
species have been described and published data are scarce. Is there anybody
interested to develop a partnership, supporting us with the identification?
Any PDF will be very welcome!
Please reply to elizabeth.neves@gmail.com
Thanking in advance for your kind attention,

Beth
