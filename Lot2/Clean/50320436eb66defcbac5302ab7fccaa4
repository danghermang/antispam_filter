Subject:[Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Rod Antennas
Alan B,


Yes I give measurements and theory in my article 'The Magnetic Dipole' antennex Sept 2011. In round figures, if you calculate the signal voltage produced by the coil alone then this will increase by around 25 times when a normal size ferrite rod (Length/Dia=12) is inserted, of permeability 250.
