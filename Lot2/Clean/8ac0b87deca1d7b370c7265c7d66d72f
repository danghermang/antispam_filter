Hello Rush,

Tell him to check  BelowWholesale.Com for below invoice prices on new cars. 
Use this info when you are ready to buy a vehicle from a dealer.

I did this something like this back in 73 when I bought a Corvette.  The 
dealer wanted $5200.00 for it.  The factory cost to dealer was $3400.00. I 
wrote several figures on slips of paper and put in different pockets.

The sales person quoted me a price and I pull out one slip of paper that had 
$3900.00 written on it and I said that is not it and show him the price 
which was $500.00 over there cost.

We haggle like that until we settle on $4200.00.  They wanted to add another 
$200.00 for servicing and undercoated which I did not want.  You do not 
under coated a fiberglass car and I painted the frame with epoxy paint and I 
will service it my self.

Kept the car till 2004 which had only 57 miles on and sold it for $25,000.00 
to a custom body shop.

Roland
