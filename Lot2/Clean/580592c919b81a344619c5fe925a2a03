Subject:[child_lit] Who are you today? (snurched from YALSA-BK)
The teen book discussion list YALSA-BK has asked its
members if they dressed up to go to work today, and asked
who they were. There are three 10th Doctors so far, and my
favorite, the woman who got a WAAF uniform on eBay and
who is going as Verity in Code Name: Verity.

How about you, child_lit folk? Who are you dressing as for
Halloween?

kids come trick or treating.
