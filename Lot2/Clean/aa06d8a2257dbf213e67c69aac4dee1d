Subject:Re: [EVDL] Best EV Tires
Hi Roland,

In my case, I know it's the brakes dragging.  When I have the car jacked up
and try to turn the tire by hand, there is a noticeable drag.  You can also
hear the brakes rubbing slightly when doing that.  With the rear wheels, you
can get 2-3 rotations with a good firm spin.  The same spin on the front
wheels only gets 1/2 rotation.  I just haven't been able to figure out what
to do about it yet.  New brake pads and calipers didn't fix it.

Mike
