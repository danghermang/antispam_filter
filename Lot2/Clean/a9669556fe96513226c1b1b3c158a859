Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
I also noticed that ferrite stick antennas usually have the winding only 
cover 20-30% of the ferrite and the coil may not be centered. Hard forme to 
believe that all that ferrite 10 diameters away is effecting the coil 
impedance.

Also the microwave ferrite Kirk mentioned are completely different animals 
than the 1 MHz antenna ferrites. The microwave ferrites often use magnetic 
spin to perform antics such a isolators, circulators and even amplifiers up 
into the 10s of GHz, The use of ferrite in microwave transformer cores is 
news to me, but I have been disconnected for around 25 years.
