Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] Novato meteorite find
These brecciated stones and the fall over an urbanized area is
reminiscent of Park Forest.  Of course, there are many differences as
well, but this one might produce more than one hammer stone like Park
Forest did, but maybe not nearly as many.

Congrats on the find Brien, and good luck to all the hunters in the field.  :)

Best regards,

MikeG

PS - is there any preliminary word yet on the type?
