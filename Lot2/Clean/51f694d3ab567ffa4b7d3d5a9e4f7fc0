id is energizing but it won't lock the letters. If I push the numbers first=
 then hold the letter button down for a few seconds , it will make the sele=
ction but that is the only way. I can't see much of a adjustment on the loc=
king bar but I'm sure that must be the answer , unless something is just to=
o worn.=A0 Thanks all Dale
