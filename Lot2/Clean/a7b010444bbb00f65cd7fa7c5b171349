PFA have expressed support for Ferdinand's right to piss off Fergie if he wants to. Statement was from Clark Carlisle, who as leading Kick it Out supporter must have had gritted teeth

Rio sold in January?

Report I read said Wright-Phillips and Hoillet didn't wear the shirts.
It will be interesting to see if Fergie takes any action against Rio. Whatever we might think of Ferdinand, it was surely up to him and his conscience whether he wore the shirt.
A white manager telling a black player what he must do in an anti-racism campaign doesn't scan well.
