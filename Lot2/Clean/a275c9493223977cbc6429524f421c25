Would anyone who watched on TV care to say whether Ramires was chopped or dived?

As I said after the first game, they're the best team we've played this season by some distance. And we can even go through if we lose in Turin as I expect Juve to lose in Donetsk
Just before the end I thought I saw someone with shaggy hair make a JT still thrown body block of a shot from close in. But it was the opposite end from me so I was probably wrong

I'm exhausted. Breathless. And I just watched on TV. Shakhtar tired or decided to shut up shop in the last 20 minutes and we pressed
But Shakhtar almost scored very late when David Luiz went walkabout, but it was Victor Moses who scored with the last kick and now a draw in Turin will see us through.
What a great game and how good are Shakhtar?
