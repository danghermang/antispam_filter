Subject:[EVDL] battery heating
I'm thinking of using one of these:

to connect 120VAC (through a fuse) to resistive heaters to turn off power to
them at 68 F.  They are rated for 100,000 cycles, the same as their control
thermostats, but uses listed are small appliances, so seems intermittent
use.  

The control thermostats:

are rated for control of heaters so seem more appropriate, but are too big,
about 2 1/2" long.  I want to mount them on a piece of brass held in place
on the LiFePO4 cell with a terminal bolt.  Any opinions on how reliable
these will perform for this application?  Current draw should be no more
than 1A, so far below the thermostat rating.
