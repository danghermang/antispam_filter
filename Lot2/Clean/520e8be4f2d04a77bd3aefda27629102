Thanks to all who have reported in. The generosity I keep reading 
about--people inviting strangers in, sharing power, etc.,--is very 
heartening during this election, which is so polarizing.  Several of you 
have said you've had no power all week but commented that others have it 
worse. I love children's book people. The best.
