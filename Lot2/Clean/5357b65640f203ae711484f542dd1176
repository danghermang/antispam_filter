Let me jump in here to try to answer your question:

I have a City IV, the box is different, however the mechanical and electroni=
cs are similar.
I had to replace the casters, so I removed the base, or floor of my box.
In doing this, it exposed all of the bass speakers. It is my guess that you w=
ill have to do the same.
It is not that hard as screws hold the bottom board together. A power screwd=
river is the best!

Except for the records (remove them), nothing will be damaged when tilting t=
he player over. Just use a pad or blanket to prevent front damage. I do sugg=
est removing the transport assy, too, since it is easy to do. (Why risk it?)=
