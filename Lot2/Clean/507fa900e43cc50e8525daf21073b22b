But this is seemingly not a car aimed at these folks. =A0I live in a very o=
dd area (probably similar to where you are), it's full of rich liberals. =
=A0I see a few Volts and Leafs every day, and a Tesla every now and again. =
=A0I think those looking to make a statement are Much more likely to buy a =
Leaf which is recognizable as an electric car than they are a Focus which l=
ooks just like it's $15k brother. =A0More realistically, they are on the li=
st for a Tesla S most likely... =A0

to them is.
