Subject:[CT Birds] Royal Terns
From Frank Mantlik
10/29 Stratford Point - 2 Royal Terns just seen in flight, just off bluff, seemed to head south into Sound.
Tide and water level lowering now, but wind is increasing (40+ mph), and visibility more limited with fog, drizzle, and spray. Safe and sound on porch.
