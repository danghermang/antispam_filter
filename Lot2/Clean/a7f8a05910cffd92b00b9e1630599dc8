Subject:[CT Birds] Unfamiliar nocturnal flight call
I just had a bird calling while flying over (at night) that I didn't recognized.  Not dissimilar to a Common Nighthawk in the down-slurred "piew", but more musical, closer to the tone and pitch of an Antillean Nighthawk, but only the single downslurred call, not the veer of a Veery.  Called twice in about 30 seconds, and had moved quite a bit in-between.   I'm stumped.  Any ideas?
