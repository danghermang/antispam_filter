The heroine of Jean Little's  'From Anna' and 'Listen for the Singing' is
partially sighted; not actually blind. Her brother is blinded in an accident
in the second book.

Another book with a partially sighted heroine is Jacqueline Wilson's 'Take a
Good Look'.

A book for younger children about a blind child is Charlotte Hudson's 'Dan
and Diesel'. Another is Genevieve Petrillo's 'Keep Your Ear on the Ball'.

Canadian author Jean Little is herself blind, and I believe several of the
characters from her novels are blind as well.  Sorry, I'm not remembering
any specific titles, though.
