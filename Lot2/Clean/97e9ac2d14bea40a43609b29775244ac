Actually, looking at traffic graphs is misleading at best.  These show
whether big telcos that have sat on their huge IPv6 allocations for
a long time finally get around to IPv6-enable their customers (or 
continue stalling), but do not really say anything about the *usability*
of IPv6 for Joe Average User.

Since the context of this discussion is "WE MUST HAVE IPv4 PI!!!", this
statement might need some adjustment to "there is no IPv4 PI, can we do
something else?", like "can we use IPv6 PI plus double-IPv4-PA?"  or 
"can we use IPv6 PI plus our ISP's friendly NAT64 translator?"...

These seem much more relevant questions to me than "can we look around
in the decks below the water line for additional deck chairs?".
