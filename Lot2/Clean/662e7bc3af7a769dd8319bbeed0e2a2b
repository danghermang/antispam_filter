Well, that seems pretty clear, so let's look at this for what may
have caused it:

> 	DateTime::new(undef, 'hour', 00, 'minute', 00, 'month', 0, 'second',
> 0, ...) called at
> /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/DateTime/Format/DateParse.pm line 58
> 	DateTime::Format::DateParse::parse_datetime('DateTime::Format::DateParse',
> '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Africa/Nairobi') called at
> /usr/share/koha/lib/C4/Members.pm line 1044

The call on /usr/share/koha/lib/C4/Members.pm line 1044 is

        $_->{date_due} =
        DateTime::Format::DateParse->parse_datetime($_->{date_due},
        $tz->name());

so, for some reason, a patron has been issued a book with a due date
of 0000-00-00 00:00:00 - that should not happen and I've not seen a
Koha do that recently, so we're probably going to need to fix it in
the database.  The next bit hints at how we might do that:

> 	C4::Members::GetPendingIssues(3594) called at
> /usr/share/koha/intranet/cgi-bin/circ/circulation.pl line 479

So it's borrowernumber 3594.  Go into mysql, SELECT FROM issues WHERE
borrowernumber = 3594 AND issues.date_due = '0000-00-00 00:00:00' and
then use UPDATE to set a real due date/time.  A full zebra reindex
may be a good idea after that, too.

It may be worth leaving out "borrowernumber = 3594 AND", to discover
if other issues have the same problem.

Hope that helps,
