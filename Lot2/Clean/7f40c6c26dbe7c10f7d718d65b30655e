I waited until I got to a real computer and could snip my reply this time :)I have a Tajima Neo embroidery machine. It is very clever but VERY big and heavy (and fun)Speaking of machines, has anyone got or used an "Able 290"? It is a hand crank patching machine replicating an 1880ish design. It moves the seam in the direction of the foot with a 360 degree swivel and can be used for bags and shoes etc. I met a guy selling them new over the weekend and am seriously tempted but they are made in China.Lynlee
What model of machine do you have?
 
Thanks,

Thickness can be adjusted by the number of passes or "bean". Repeat patterns can have variability added by slight size or angle changes, just enough to fool the eye. There are now spiral fills which give quite an opus anglorum look. No real stem stitch but a very highly angled satin stitch or tatiama. Good programmes can do colour blending and photo like images. I can do applique and even embroider leather. You can also do free standing lace which is good for miniature making or getting just the right design.
