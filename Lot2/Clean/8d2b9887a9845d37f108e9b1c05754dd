Sat November 17, 2012 -  Ride to Schwenksville  (ad-hoc ride)  meet at Ft. Washington State Park Hawk Watch Parking Lot (http://phillybikeclub.org/newbcp/rides/class?id=20#20 is the link for information about the start location.). The ride leaves at 9:30 am. Class C+, 13-14mph, 44 miles, The weekend forecast is looking promising, so how about joining me on one of my favorite routes. Scenic, low traffic country roads, mostly rolling hills with no real killers, a comfortable pace, and regrouping as needed. We'll have a couple of food options in Schwenksville just past the midway point. Check back for a possible faster pace.
  Cue sheets will be available.
