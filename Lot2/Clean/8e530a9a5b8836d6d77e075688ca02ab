This was the official word on Monday:


"Today's MRI scans on John Terry's right knee thankfully show no significant damage to the cruciate ligaments.

Chelsea Football Club's medical team will conduct further tests over the next two or three days once the swelling has subsided to determine how long John will be out, but it will be a matter of weeks not months."


Haven't seen anything more.
