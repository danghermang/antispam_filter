Hi George,

The Consensus ontology looks very promising to me!
But I need some time to dig into that a bit deeper... I'll come back to you 
soon!

Cheers

Dear Marc and Michael, all

i hope i am not "interrupting" your discussion, but it seems to me there is 
something here which i may be able to contribute - even though unfortunately 
i have not been active on the list, i still do some work on the topic.

So, i am glad to see that the discussion is getting active and entering what 
appears to me like a standardization / integration stage. Typically, there 
are 2 ways to deal with interoperability - on the functionality and on the 
data level. So in your example, that would translate to having T1 being able 
to call some API on T2 in order to perform functions on it on behalf of a T1 
user, and vice versa, and having T1 and T2 exchange some data in order to 
process them.

Some common denominator can be agreed on on both levels, however i would 
like to emphasize more on the data side of things here. It seems to me that 
what you are doing is trying to come up with a schema to describe basic 
domain entities, their properties and relations - in other words, come up 
with a domain ontology. I do not want to lecture anyone here or to go on 
extensively about this, but i would just like to point out to a body of 
scientific work on the subject that you may be interested in - there's no 
point in reinventing the wheel after all.

So, a couple of simple domain models for argumentative discussions and 
consensus already exist:
1. A consensus ontology, based on IBIS, problem marketplaces and idea 
management: http://www.imc.com.gr/ontologies/eDialogos/consensus/
2. An argumentative discussion ontology, based on IBIS and SIOC: 
http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-405/paper4.pdf
3. A survey of existing work in the domain: 
http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj138_2.pdf

The 1st and 2nd approach can be harmonized, and this is set as future work. 
There is also a body of work on the aspect of consensus on the ontology 
development process itself which could be interesting here. Hope this helps, 
let me know if you are interested in more details.

best regards
George Anadiotis

Hi Marc,

Although I'm not a member of the Meinungsfindungstool working group, I
have a personal concern with what you're working on.  Specifically it
involves the problem of "split consensus" as Thomas von der Elbe has
called it, or "split opinion formation" in your own terms.

But first I have some questions.  Do you have time to answer?

I try to picture what you describe (pardon my ASCII):

             ....
          ..........  M
        ..............   ....
       .......................
       ......................
        .............   ....
          ..........
             ...


            +-----+  +-----+
            |     |  |     |
            | T1  |  | T2  |
            |     |  |     |
            +-|-|-+  +-|-|-+
    +---------|-|------|-|---+
    |         | |      | |   |
    |                        |
    |    S                   |
    |                        |
    +------------------------+


     M  Opinion in formation
     T  Competing tools
     S  Common standards, practices,
        databases, and so forth


Here T1 and T2 are competing tools for the purpose of opinion forming.
A user may choose T1 or T2.  But regardless of the choice (say it is
T2), the user will remain part of the same overall opinion forming
process (M).  So he/she may continue to work with other users who make
different choices (T1).  This technical freedom of choice is made
possible by the common standards, practices and/or databases (S) that
are shared between the competing tools.  Is this picture correct?

Hi Michael,

There is always time, when people doing the right things together ;o)

So you wrote

To be honest you don't need to be a member of our working group - even not
of Pirate Party - when you want to cooperate with us. It's all about coming
together and working on the right things.

>But first I have some questions.  Do you have time to answer?

Sure, you are welcome.

Sorry, I can't cite your ascii ;o)

Yes, that's what our working group tries to establish.

And even more, if the user starts with T1 and then recognizes that T2 fits
better to his needs, than he can just switch over to T2, if T2 provides a
migration path to the Common Business Entity Model (CBEM) ;o)

Here is a first draft of our idea of a Common Business Entity Model (where
'Business' means it's not a 'Data' Entity Relationship Model assignable to a
database schema, it's just objects found in the real world - the database
schema might look totally different):
http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/4/45/DSFS-BusinessEntityModel.jpg

Unfortunately it's not fully translated yet, but I hope you understand our
intention. The blue rectangles are objects that are part of the base
framework standard. The red ones are specific to plug-ins, using the blue
ones to inherit from, or just defining new ones.

At the end the blue ones are those who all tools should be able to convert
their own Model into. That's the way the different tools can interchange
their data.

Does this make sense?

Cheers
Marc
