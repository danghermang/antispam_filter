Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] 6973 to el84 info needed.
I found some matched pairs of 6973eh online, but I read they had some quali=
ty issues and the tubes just didn't work. =20
  If I go with the 6973 s should I replace those resistors that are off.  B=
oth the schematic and banding tell me 470k but they measure way off.  Maybe=
 that is why the existing 6973 tests at 50%.  It was cooked.  I'm also goin=
g to replace the 1 watt bias resistor and diode.  What diode would you use =
a 1n4004?
Thanks
