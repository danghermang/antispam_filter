Subject:Re: [Koha] A question for users of Koha, about searching
We use Advance Search quite a bit since it allows us to limit by 
collection and date. We use collections differently than most, in that 
our collections are things like Broadsides, Genealogical Materials, 
Photographs, Manuscripts, Maps,  Electronic Records, etc. and are very 
useful for researchers.
