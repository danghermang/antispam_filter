Subject:[h-cost] ladies MOL group?
My brother brought me a box of stuff from grandma and her sisters - a lot of 
it is textiles of various types. Pillow cases, etc.

One thing that intrigues me is a pale green dress (crocheted, I think) with 
a matching coin purse and a matching colored cloth garrison cap that has 3 
letters sewn on M O L

i've done some google searching unsuccessfully - I don't know what group 
might use this.  I suppose it could be a local garden/card club or 
something, but I wondered if it wasn't a charity or military aux. from the 
mid 19th century - Iowa.

thoughts?
