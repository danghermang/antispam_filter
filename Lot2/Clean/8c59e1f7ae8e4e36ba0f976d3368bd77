Subject:[burners] Room opening up in Central(ish) Square
Hello friends and compatriots----


I know of a haus that will have an empty room come January 1st, 2013. If
you know of anyone looking for a room in a burner/nerd/artist/weirdo
friendly household, do pass my information along to them. It is my desire
in flying from the nest to replace myself with someone for them to build a
new colorful chapter with.
Thank you muchly for your time----
