Subject:[Jukebox-list] eBay "sale" ?
Hi All,
There is a seller on eBay, offering a "pair of Seeburg blue t needles",=A0 =
(used) that is NOT a "pair"--well, yes, there are two pictured, and I guess=
 the word "pair" means two--but if you want to look at them, notice the "co=
lor dots"--one is green and the other is red.=A0 These needles were sold in=
 MATCHED pair packages, and were meant to be changed in a matched pair only=
.=A0 Besides which--these are USED sapphire needles ??=A0=20
There was another pair, of the same used items, that just sold for at least=
 $80.00 (last time I noticed the price)---
Guys--I have some used diamond ones, make me an offer I can't refuse, and y=
ou gottem !
Ron Rich=20
