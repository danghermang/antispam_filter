I don't think you can appeal yellow cards, even if there's 2 of them

The overriding piece in this incident, is that the complaints were made in heat, after the debacle that was Sunday's game.  If this had been made after a win or a draw then we wouldn't have to put up with the shite coming from Warnock et al, and it wouldn't be viewed as sour grapes as it is by many in the press.  That said, even when said in heat, if it was what was heard then Chelsea had little choice in going forward.

However, as staunch a fan as I am, as soon as I heard the complaint, I went "Oh, shit.  Here we go again."

On a side note, has the club not appealed Torres' red card?  I thought that would have been the obvious step.  Or have a missed something?  Or has Clattenburg saying in retrospect he got it right precluded that?  Or because it just rules him out of tonight's game, where he wasn't going to play anyway just made it easy for them to forget it?

The difficulty of the situation is that if CFC receive the complaint, as they have, but don't pass it on immediately, investigate it themselves, as they are currently doing, but find that, while the accusation is honestly made, there's little likelihood of the complaint succeeding so don't take it forward, that if it isn't made known, including the fullest disclosure of how seriously they've investigated it, a journalist will pick up the story and declaim us for not treating the subject seriously enough to back it in front of the FA.

I'm beginning to think the club will be criticised whatever way they approach it.

As happy as I'd be if Gourlay were to be sacked due to his mishandling of this and other issues, he could do little else. Maybe next time then.

Harry
