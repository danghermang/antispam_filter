I checked James Townsend & the cost for the amount of buttons for just one coat is quite high. Does anyone know where I can get larger amounts for a lower cost? I would really appreciate it.

Sometimes they never show, but the tunic is long and full enough that I wear it as a dress and scarf anyway.  Since I no longer have to conform, i. e. I can be excentric, I can wear it to work and get compliments from the young folk.  I'd say you have parts.of a Salwar/Kameze outfit.
