THE RED UMBRELLA by Christina Diaz Gonzalez

"The Red Umbrella is the moving tale of a 14-year-old girl's journey from
Cuba to America as part of Operation Pedro Pan=97an organized exodus of more
than 14,000 unaccompanied children, whose parents sent them away to escape
Fidel Castro's revolution.

In 1961, two years after the Communist revolution, Luc=EDa =C1lvarez still =
leads
a carefree life, dreaming of parties and her first crush. But when the
soldiers come to her sleepy Cuban town, everything begins to change.
Freedoms are stripped away. Neighbors disappear. Her friends feel like
strangers. And her family is being watched.

 As the revolution's impact becomes more oppressive, Luc=EDa's parents make
the heart-wrenching decision to send her and her little brother to the
United States=97on their own.

 Suddenly plunked down in Nebraska with well-meaning strangers, Luc=EDa
struggles to adapt to a new country, a new language, a new way of life. But
what of her old life? Will she ever see her home or her parents again? And
if she does, will she still be the same girl?

 The Red Umbrella is a moving story of country, culture, family, and the
true meaning of home."
