Subject:[meteorite-list] Alain Carion's car jacking and loss of 300,
	00 euros worth of meteorites!
Hi all,

Just been made aware by my mum in France who sent me a new clipping
from Ouest France newspaper that Alain Carion was the victim of a car
jacking where his car was later found burnt out still containing
300,000 euros worth of his meteorites, all gone up in smoke! What a
terrible story! It appears that the thieves had the wrong car and
mistook Alain for a gem dealer from the Nantes show he was returning
from. What a complete and utter nightmare! I am glad Alain is ok but
what a loss :-(

The link to the article online is below (in French)
