Depending on the timing I would be interested... I am 2 hours away but in DC frequently.  have you investigated the Children's Book Guild yet.  i just joined recently.  They have lunches with great speakers once per month. Usually meet at Busboys and Poets.

So, first order of business, clearly we need a better name than that.

I've just moved to DC, child lit! Previously in New York, I was part of the
second generation of Kid Lit Drink Night planners (that illustrious
gathering of great minds originally spearheaded by our own Cheryl Klein and
NYPL's Betsy Bird) and it was always great fun and lovely to see everyone.

I'm wondering if there is a crowd/any interest in gathering here in the
DC/Maryland/VA region. If so, please let me know! I hope to put an outing
together in the next couple of weeks/months.

Christina, newly of the DCPL
