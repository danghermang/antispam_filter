Subject:[Chelsea] Mark Clattenburg and Chelsea row following controversial
	encounter is messy and must not be allowed to drag on [Telegraph]
[HS: If you take out all the mistakes beforehand this same defence of
"Clatts" could've been used by Terry. And if had it would be laughed
out. Every ex-official, paper, FA are issuing glowing reports before
both sides have been heard and leaking it straight back out. I've even
read one guy say Mikel should be sued if the charge isn't proved, which
will do no service whatsoever to other players with real claims. Kick it
Out are said to be deliberately holding back and maintaining a watching
brief. No doubt how this will end]

If Mark Clattenburg uttered a racist remark to Chelsea=92s John Obi Mikel,
then his career as a referee died on the pitch as dusk fell at Stamford
Bridge on Sunday Oct 28, 2012

By Henry Winter, Football Correspondent

If Clattenburg is innocent, as the elite refereeing community gathering
at St George=92s Park on Monday believe he is, then it is Chelsea who need
vigorously calling to account by the FA. =93Mark said nothing,=92=92 insist=
ed
a leading official. Nothing.

The feeling among certain referees contacted on Tuesday is that this is
a trumped-up charge, that Clattenburg would never resort to such
offensive, discriminatory language. They want the FA to address the
matter today, moving swiftly to still the latest storm to buffet the
national game.

Chelsea dispute the referees=92 support for Clattenburg rigorously,
alleging the Tyneside official called Mikel a =93monkey=94 when booking him
for dissent shortly after Javier Hernandez=92s controversial winner for
Manchester United. Chelsea also infer that Clattenburg described Juan
Mata as a =93Spanish t--t=94.

Chelsea tempers were running high midway through the second half, the
mercury sent spiralling skywards by Clattenburg decisions. He sent off
Branislav Ivanovic correctly for bringing down Ashley Young. Ten men
went to mow, to borrow a line from the Matthew Harding Stand.

Clattenburg then dismissed Fernando Torres incorrectly. Nine men went to
mow, went to mow a meadow full of red-shirted opponents who duly reaped
a harvest of three points with Hernandez=92s offside goal, sending the
game hurtling into meltdown.

Chelsea hit back off the pitch. They claim to have three players ready
and willing to corroborate the testimonies of Mikel and Mata. It is
understood that one of their dressing-room number is known to be uneasy
at his employer=92s aggressive stance towards Clattenburg.

Hardly pausing for breath or second thought, Chelsea point out that
Mikel went into the referee=92s room to confront Clattenburg. This is
where the story becomes messy and confusing. The Nigerian midfielder is
one of the more sanguine characters in the madhouse of English football,
not an individual whose blood races quickly to boiling point, so
something must have piqued him. But what? An order by Clattenburg to
calm down? A misunderstanding of what Clattenburg said?

The truth will out: the mikes were open. The assistant referees Michael
McDonough and Simon Long as well as fourth official Michael Jones will
have heard what, if anything, Clattenburg said to Mikel and Mata.
Officials congregating at St George=92s Park discussed this, also rallying
to Clattenburg=92s defence.

He is popular. English referees appreciate the way he has joined Howard
Webb in promoting their reputation across the globe. Fifa considered
Clattenburg good enough to oversee the Olympic final at Wembley. He=92s a
candidate for the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil.

As well as being a referee considered =93one of the elite in the world=94
according to the Premier League on Tuesday, Clattenburg is also quietly
respected for the good deeds he does in the charity sphere. No fuss, no
limelight. Clattenburg teamed up with fellow-referee Mark Halsey to
compete this year=92s Great North Run to raise funds for a cancer charity.

Such efforts are all very admirable. Such backing from other members of
the whistling community is terrific. But only the FA can fully ascertain
whether Clattenburg made racist comment. He vehemently denies Chelsea=92s
allegation. By contrast, he is known within the game as being an
official who attempts to engage with players, not being stand-offish
like some of his colleagues.

Early in his career, on being fast-tracked by the FA who saw his
potential, Clattenburg was arguably too friendly with players.

Concerns were expressed by some of his colleagues that he was caught up
in the glamour of working alongside such sporting celebrities. That was
Clattenburg Mark I. He took time out, took wise counsel from more
experienced referees, and re-emerged as a more considered official.

His maturing led to Clattenburg Mark II, bringing increased involvement
in Fifa and Uefa competitions. Now, aged 37, Clattenburg appeared to
have the balance right between working with the players, cajoling and
sharing a joke, and controlling them.

It=92s not easy. Refereeing has never been more difficult. Officials must
live with the perfect storm of quick, oft-cynical players racing from
end to end in a game covered by 30-odd camera angles, instant replays
for the commentators, and an unruly jury on the terraces and on Twitter.

Modern referees need the wisdom of Solomon, the patience of Job, the
probity of Caesar=92s Wife, the stamina of Mo Farah and the acceleration
of Usain Bolt. Oh, and the thick skin of a rhino. Oh, and good friends
too. It was little surprise to see Clattenburg being picked up by a
fellow-referee, Michael Oliver, yesterday morning before heading south
to St George=92s.

Just as Chelsea have those ready to condemn Clattenburg, so the man
himself has those ready to fight his corner. Referees love this mad,
marvellous game, the adrenalin, the profile, the career, but is it worth
having their name splashed across the back-pages, their manhood and
integrity questioned and family hounded for =A380,000 a year?

And so the FA is investigating swiftly. It is in nobody=92s interests for
the sport=92s latest racial controversy to drag on as Chelsea managed with
the John Terry affair. Inevitably there will be scepticism about
Chelsea=92s motives, suspicions that the club seek to manoeuvre themselves
on to a rare position on the moral high ground yet, in fairness, they
must respond to any expressed grievances by their players.

For all the widespread perception of Chelsea as a club without class off
the pitch, as essentially an organisation that has harried officials
like Anders Frisk and Tom Henning Ovrebro into early retirements, any
allegation of racism needs airing. Chelsea=92s chief executive, Ron
Gourlay has pushed through this complaint to the Premier League and now
FA.

Gourlay=92s credibility as a man fit to govern a leading club like Chelsea
sustained a pummelling during the cackhanded handling of the
Terry-Ferdinand saga.

The latest edition of the fanzine cfcuk carries a picture of Gourlay on
the cover with the words: =93(Sorry but) You don=92t know what you=92re
doing=94. If only the true-blue, warm-hearted, right-minded spirit of
Matthew Harding continued to suffuse Chelsea they would have stronger
leadership.

Gourlay could be right. Clattenburg may have a case to answer, although
the word among referees was that he was being unfairly maligned.
Clattenburg had a terrible game at the Bridge but that does not mean he
was either dishonest or racist.
