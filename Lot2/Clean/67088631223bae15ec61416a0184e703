i think you may be underestimating your credibility on the wider range
of issues affecting our community. you didn't need to mention any
specific proposal such as a continuation of the ipv6 fee waivers in
order to garner significant support in this or any election of industry
participants.

that having been said, we are past "ipv6 launch" and v6 is now available
full time from the deepest and
hottest content providers on the internet. a network operator who turns
on ipv6 will see significant traffic. v6 is no longer an experiment or a
toy, and its inevitability is no longer debatable.

continuing a fee waiver to support something that has clearly got legs,
can be argued to shift arin's cost burden onto non-ipv6 adopters, for no
imaginable advantage in terms of the rate of v6 deployment.
