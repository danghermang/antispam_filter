No doubt they are. But there's a difference between broken and a
serious threat for most people.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but CRIME does _not_ allow for an attacker to
decrypt SSL traffic on-the-fly anywhere as easily as knowledge of the
private keys would. Wikipedia actually adds that it would also require
"inducing the browser to make multiple carefully crafted web
connections to the target site". I think this makes it a hard attack.
Far from impossible to use of course, and something that should worry
those managing big sites, but it is not something that can easily be
deployed in a mass-attack.

I have to admit here that I have no good reason not to use DNSSEC. It
doesn't matter in most cases, but even to prevent me from giving the
crooks some extra money via rogue advertisements (like DNSChanger) I
should look into using DNSSEC. I will!

One reason I'm a little reluctant is that it kind of adds a false
sense of security. Because what if someone uses a Diginotar-like hack
against DNSSEC? In a browser you can at least disable a certificate. I
don't think in DNSSEC you can.

I agree about bridging the airgap being done really cleverly by
Stuxnet. (I think it used four zero-days. That is more than any other
known piece of malware.) But, from having spoken to people who have
researched the code, the actual attack on the SCADA was extremely well
executed and required advanced skills as well as knowledge of the
working of that particular system.

(Flame didn't target SCADAs btw. It was "just" a piece of spyware.)

Mind you, I have no good explanation as why we don't see more attacks
on SCADAs (they are a "great" target for a group of careless,
unethical hacktivists), but it is a fact we don't. I personally
believe that such attacks are slightly less trivial to do in practise
as they seem in theory.

Sure. And if you do anything that could upset a government, I would
strongly recommend not using something like Google to talk about that.
Especially if said government is that of Iran.

The fact that governments can do this and possibly are doing this
(without adhering to proper legal procedures) should worry us as a
society, much more than it currently does. It does not affect the way
most people use the Internet.

No, I see what you mean. And that Java example (CVE-2012-4681, to give
it its proper name) is a good (or bad) example of a zero-day being
used in mass-attacks before it was patched. (I don't consider
MetaSploit a mass attack. Blackhole is.) But then, as I said, this was
Oracle and Java. For some time good practise has been to disable Java
at least on the browser you use for everyday Internet browsing. This
would have prevented any infections.

The other "big zero-day" discovered recently (CVE-2012-4969 in
Internet Explorer) was patched quickly and, if I'm not mistaken,
before the first reports of it being used in-the-wild surfaced.

I guess I am. I'm also reasonably well aware of the other 1, or 0.1
per cent and what it would take to protect me against these threats.
I've made a well-informed decision it's not worth the effort. (For
instance, I can take 1000s of extra measures against attacks of my
online banking. Instead I decided that, given the efforts I have
already made, if something does go wrong, my bank is likely to
refund.)

That's another reason for me not to try and reach that top 0.00001% of
systems: a system is as secure as the weakest link in its security
chain. At some point you reach the point where those weakest links are
those beyond your control.

Haha. I can only agree with that, especially if I add that my advice
was really only meant for Linux home users!
