Rick,
Try the following "trick" and let me know what happens--
Remove both of the large "Cinch-Jones Plugs" from the WSR, and connect them=
 together--make selections in all letter/number combinations.=20

Have two Seeburg model C's that I've been restoring. Put electronics back i=
n both and now when I make a selection, it takes off credits but won pull a=
 pin. Both machines exhibiting the same trouble
=20
 Here's what ive done so far and here is whats going on.=20

Took the credit cancel unit out of the WSR, cleaned all the usual items, ve=
ified contact gaps on timing relay and cancel solenoid switch stack.
Cleaned and checked adjustment on electrical selector hold and snap switche=
s.
Took apart the pinbank and cleaned all 100 contact washers, and contact pla=
tes, and group coil contact plates on top.

Connected everything back up and now when i establish credit, and make a se=
lection, no levers move on pinbank. It does take credits off.=20
Verified 1 amp fuse and checked fuse holder for good connection. If i manua=
lly pull a pin, mech starts scanning immediately, so i think the service sw=
itch is functioning properly.=A0=20

Using the service manual and troubleshooting guide I've checked and recheck=
ed=20

Can someone point me in the right direction?

Thanks!

Rick
