I think it's important to have transparency in election administration to a=
ssure fair elections.=A0 One problem with a lack of transparency is that it=
 engenders accusations that may or may not be false but for which truth or =
falsehood cannot be determined.

I like going to prime source instead of relying on any third party research=
 and reporting.=A0 I'm conversant with things like SEC 10-Ks etc and tried =
to research Hart Intercivic ownership.=A0 Problem is that Hart Intercivic a=
ppears not to be publicly held so they seem not have any requirement for re=
porting their ownership.=A0 In any case there is nothing readily available =
about it.=A0 To me that's a problem because there is no way for the public =
to know about potential conflicts of interest.=A0 The one thing that is vis=
ible on the Hart website is that 3 of 5 directors are from HIG Capital, whi=
ch gives them control of the company.=A0 The connections between HIG Capita=
l and Bain are pretty clear, with one of the HIG Capital founders a former =
partner at Bain.=A0 It's enough to raise questions that need to be addresse=
d.

How important are fair elections?=A0 How necessary is transparency in count=
ing votes to ensure fairness?

Is it a problem when the CEO of a company that sells electronic voting mach=
ines that cannot be inspected by the public chairs the election campaign fo=
r a candidate and states publicly "I am committed to doing everything in my=
 power to delivering electoral votes to my candidate"?=A0 (google O'Dell Di=
ebold Ohio Bush 2004 if you think I'm making that up)

How do we protect the ability of voters to be sure their votes will be coun=
ted fairly no matter which way they are cast?

Are we of like mind about those questions at least?
