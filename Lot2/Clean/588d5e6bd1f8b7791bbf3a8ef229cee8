That's correct. It comes in about mid car on the driver's side. The opening
is actually above the gas tank and has a wire mesh in it to stop rodents
from entering that way. The air is sucked in and goes thru PCM, Power
Control Module (which contains the DC/DC , Voltage Converter Module, IGBTs)
and the fan which then pushes the air out thru the bottom of the car
(screened again).

I've thought about that and it is still a possibility. Thanks for the
suggestion. The gas tank is right there, so I have to be careful.
