It's a raspberry pi running RISC OS connected to a Motorola Atrix
lapdock. They cost hundreds of dollars until they got discontinued and
could be had at verizon for $50... It has 2 USB ports, and one is used
to power the Raspberry Pi (v1.0 - the new ones can be powered directly
from the micro usb port of the lapdock requiring 2 cables only instead
of 3). So you could plug a USB to serial and plug in an old 28.8...

The screen, although I said 1080p (and the RISC OS says 1920x1080 by
default), is actually only a 1360x768 native resolution. RISC OS does
the interpolation (renders fonts well too, that OS). You can create an
MDF so it runs at the native resolution (from memory, i think in
boot.resources.configure.monitors)

I put more pictures up, with all the adapters you'll need:

So yeah, it doesn't look as good from the back, but at least no duct tape.
