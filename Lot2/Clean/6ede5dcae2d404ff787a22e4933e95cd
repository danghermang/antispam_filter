Subject:Re:  Date data handlin {was: no subject] 
>From your pasted snippet, the biggest problem was spaces - between the "$"
and the RE var name and a space after the RE string - this works:
 my $dateST = qr{\d{4} \d{2} \d{2}};
my $dateEND = qr{\d{2} \d{2} \d{4}};
my $line;

  while (<DATA>)
  {
    s#[-/]# #g;
    print "D: $_";
    my $line = $_;
    if($line =~ /^$dateST/) {
              my ($year,$month,$day,$hour,$min,$sec,@rain) = split;
      $_ = sprintf "%5.1f", $_ foreach @rain;

      print " $year $month $day $hour $min $sec\t", join(" ", @rain), "\n";
      # print $outfd " $year $month $day $hour $min $sec\t", join(" ",
@rain), "\n";
               print "START: $year $month $day $hour $min $sec\t", join("
", @rain), "\n";
     }
            elsif($line =~ /^$dateEND/)
     {
              my ($month,$day,$year,$hour,$min,$sec,@rain) = split;
      $_ = sprintf "%5.1f", $_ foreach @rain;

      print "End: $year $month $day $hour $min $sec\t", join(" ", @rain),
"\n";

@rain), "\n";
