Subject:Re: [arin-ppml] Utilization policy is not aggregate

We're very near exhaustion so any new policy should be framed with the 
transfer market in mind.

If somebody's willing to sell, and somebody else is willing to buy, but 
they can't justify it because of a math problem - well, I'd be in favour 
of changing it.

So the example is really this:

"if you are at 90% of a /16, and all that's available for purchase is a 
/20, is it really a problem if after purchase you'd be able to buy more?"

If you have to use 80% (or even 50%) of all allocations, that eliminates that loophole.
