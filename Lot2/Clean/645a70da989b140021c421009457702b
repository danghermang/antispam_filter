Subject:[CT Birds] Storm impacts to Coastal Waterbird Sites
Reports are coming in about the condition of sites that are important to beach nesting birds and other coastal waterbirds.  We have started an album to post "after" photos of coastal locations, which can be found here:

There are also links to "before" photos on the page, link to which can be found below.  If you have any photos to share that you wouldn't mind us using on our Facebook page, with photo credit, please send them to me off-line.

The changes to Long Beach and Long Beach West are dramatic.  It's a good thing that those cottages were removed in 2011, as nearly everything that was left standing after Irene would have been washed away by Sandy, lead and PCB paint, mercury switches and asbestos and all would be scattered across the Great Meadows Marsh.
