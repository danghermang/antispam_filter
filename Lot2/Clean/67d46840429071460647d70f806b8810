Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Seeburg 1950s DiNoc Cabinet Finish Restorations
John, been awhile since I've posted here. I collect and restore (when I hav=
e time) both old tube radios and jukes. In 1937 Philco started using "photo=
 finish" wood grain veneer on their mid-range table radios. The photo finis=
h was a wood grain printed on paper such that it could be applied over vene=
er substrate and looked just like a wood veneer finish and a clear lacquer =
overcoat was applied highlite and protect the paper finish. However, over t=
ime the lacquer finish dried out and the paper finish started showing scrat=
ches which appear as white marks in the finish. Many amateur restorers trie=
d to strip the finish only to find the photo finish turned to goo and only =
the white / blond substrate was left. Some more adanced restorers have actu=
ally "photo-shopped" the wood grain on their computers to use on these type=
 radios. =0AAt one time I had a 1946 Seeburg 146 Trashcan in the garage and=
 I=A0cannot remember if Seeburg=A0used a=A0"photo finish" on these models o=
r the=A0plastic based Di-Noc. I'm thinking it was Di-Noc as the wood grain =
actually "rubbed" off rather than peeled or flaked off. I imagine that in t=
he Seeburg manufacturing process the=A0Di-Noc was applied over "blanks," ie=
. stock wood sheets or sheet metal that were then cut / bent to fit in juke=
box construction. That's why, to Ed Liss's point, it will be more difficult=
 to re-do what was done at the factory. I assume you have gone on-line to f=
ind 3Ms current inventory of Di-Noc wood patterns. I can't remember last ti=
me I looked if they have an updated material that has superceded Di-Noc.=0A=
