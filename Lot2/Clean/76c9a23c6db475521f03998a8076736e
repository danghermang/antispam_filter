Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Hi

The main point to remember about ferrite antennas is the losses, which
are high.  For that reason this kind of antenna is most used below 1.6
MHz for receiving, in systems where there is plenty of field strength.
 I thought it might be useful to jump ahead to see what to expect from
a typical ferrite-rod antenna.

For a typical ferrite rod antenna of 100x10 mm wound with 10 turns at
1 MHz the following parameters apply in round numbers (Alan Payne's
figures might differ, he said by about 10 dB):

Radiation resistance:  1E-8 ohms,
Reactance: 700 ohms,
Tuning capacitor: 200 pF
Loss resistance (assuming a tuned Q of 100): 7 ohms
Radiation efficiency: with tuning 1E-9, without tuning 1E-11.

We can now take away the ferrite, leaving the coil, and the parameters
are obviously different:
Radiation resistance: 4E-12,
Reactance: 14 ohms,
Tuning capacitor: 10,000 pF
Loss resistance (assuming a tuned Q of 200): 0.07 ohms
Radiation efficiency: with tuning 2E-11, without tuning 2E-13.

These numbers might seem strange, but they show that the presence of
the ferrite improves the radiation efficiency.  But it only improves
it from impossible to extremely bad :)  If there is any interest in
how these figures are derived, we can discuss them.  This level of
performance is all right for a transistor radio, by the way.

I might have made some errors in the numbers, but these are put up as
a starting point and I don't mind sticking my neck out in the
interests of science :).
