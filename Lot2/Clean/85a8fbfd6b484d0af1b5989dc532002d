So you need to get a 1394b (800) to 1394a (400) cable. I have used the Mac
Mini with the Flex radios without any problems. In fact, they are a good
match. You can set the Mini right on top of the 5000 or 3000 and get a
really short bonding cable between them to greatly reduce the possibility
of RFI problems.
