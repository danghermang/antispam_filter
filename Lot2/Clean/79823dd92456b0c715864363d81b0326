Just a heads up - other people's experiences may of course vary but
purely from my own experiences, CrossOver is as much of a liability as a
boon. There is nothing that can't be achieved by CrossOver that can't
also be done by good old regular wine (worst case, you might need to
update via PPA/repo/etc to get a really recent version with the latest
bells and whistles). Wine is of course properly free, much more actively
maintained and tweaked and infinitely more hackable. There are literally
thousands of howtos and guides on the internet and the winedb usually
has step by step info on pretty much every windows application you can
possibly think of. CrossOver has never helped me more with the really
big asks (CAD programs, Adobe CS, MS Office, etc) than wine.

Thanks to the advent of very powerful affordable hardware and the rise
of virtualization technology I find myself using wine less and less
anyway, but although YMMV, honestly, CrossOver is just a big fat waste
of time, even if you don't have to pay for it. Incidentally, CrossOver
rarely works out of the box like they say - you'll frequently find
yourself hacking it about following obscure forum posts on their site
and you will find yourself asking "why the hell aren't I just using wine
again?".
