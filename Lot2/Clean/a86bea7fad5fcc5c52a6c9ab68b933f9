Subject:[EVDL] Regen vs. coast was Best EV Tires
Hello Harry
 
There really is nothing to debate concerning regen and coasting. It is  
always better to coast unless you have to use the brakes. 
 
First off let me say I am a fan of AC systems with Regen. I live in a hilly 
 area that is like a large roller coaster in the Southwest section  of 
Portland, Oregon. Hills vary from around 1000 feet in elevation and many  are 
very steep. I have over 100,000 miles of driving mostly an OEM S-10 EV. I do  
have a RAV4 EV, Ranger EV, Leaf and have owned a Solectria Force. All these  
vehicles have regen and I have driven them a lot as well.
 
I have recovered as high as 30% of the energy even with the losses of  
recharging the pack. This was not over the whole course of the trip only a  half 
a mile of one hill. This was based on the  amount of capacity used to go up 
the hill and how much was  recovered on the way back down.  
 
It takes a lot of energy to bring a vehicle up to speed from a stop.   So 
again it is always better to retain as much of your speed as possible. I  
always coast as soon as possible if I see a potential stop ahead. I use regen 
to  retain the maximum amount of speed possible. I try to avoid coming to a  
stop when ever possible.  
 
I would estimate for the average driver on flat ground you might have a 5%  
gain with regen. If you drive like an ICE or have to because of traffic the 
best  recovery would be around 10%. 
 
Of course there are stop signs, red lights and many other reasons you can't 
 always coast. For them regen is great but only because you are not able to 
coast  or must come to a stop. 
 
On the other point brought up by Chris. 
 
You can shut off the regen on the Solectria and the following OEM EVs.  The 
1998 to 2001 Ford Ranger EV, 2002- 2003 Toyota RAV4-EV. 
 
On the OEM 1997-1998 S-10 EV and the Nissan Leaf you can control the  regen 
with the accelerator and brake.

oooo, we've not had a good regen vs.  coast debate in a while...

i think in flat terrain it is theoretically  possible to be more efficient 
with coasting but if hills are added then i  think regen will GAIN slightly.

i have a DC system in my bus and an AC  system with regen in my bradley and 
i coast as much as possible with the DC  system and i miss the coasting 
with my regen system, but after a year of regen  driving i've come to the 
conclusion that regen is better regardless of which  one is theoretically more 
efficient:

for coasting to be efficient it  requires more planning and better driving 
skills and it is a bit unsafe and  could upset other drivers,  where as 
regen allows you be efficient while  still driving like everyone else [i.e. not 
really paying  attention]
