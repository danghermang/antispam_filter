Subject:[child_lit] NYC area child_lit folks: 2nd Annual 90-Second Newbery
 Film Festival, Dec. 2
Hello, fellow child_litters,
*
*For those of you in and around New York City, you might be interested in
coming to the 90-Second Newbery Film
Festival<http://www.90secondnewbery.com/>on December 2 at Symphony
Space.
 *
*It's an annual video contest in which filmmakers of any age (but mostly
children) make movies that tell the entire story of a Newbery award-winning
book in 90 seconds or less.

It'll be co-hosted by me and *Jon Scieszka, *with special guests Newbery
winners *Kate DiCamillo, Rita Williams-Garcia, *and *Margi Preus. *Children's
book illustrators/artists *Dan Yaccarino* and *Brian Floca* will also be
featured in the festivities. Details here:

*Wondering what it'll be like? Monica Edinger of this very list did a very
nice write-up<http://medinger.wordpress.com/2011/11/06/the-90-second-newbery-film-festival-a-review/>of
last year's sold-out screening at the New York Public Library. So did
kidlit superblogger Betsy
Bird.<http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2011/11/07/the-90-second-newbery-film-festival-new-york-style/>It
was a hoot! It shall be again!

All the details of the 90-Second Newbery, including details of the
screenings, rules, and a few of the best videos I've received, can be found

Hope to see some of you there!
