Re: Same musicians live & recordings? As a non-musician festival director, I 
suppose it's a truth in advertising issue.

I have not seen it as much lately, but several years ago, bands would add 
ringers or extra people for the Sacramento Jubilee (name at the time). So 
when hiring them for a subsequent festival it was always necessary to ask 
and nail down who the band personnel will be.
