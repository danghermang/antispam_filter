Dear Bob,
Your memory ain't too bad for a young fella.
<big grin>
In Joe Darensboug's 1987 book ' Jazz Odyssey' he says on (pages 182-83) tha=
t they were in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1963, "around Christmas" when "Hell=
o Dolly' started making the charts in America", they had all forgotten the =
tune, the lead sheet had been lost by Bob the band boy, the single could no=
t be found in San Juan and one was flown down from New York.  =

Louis premiered it on stage at the Hotel San Juan and "he had to take about=
 eight curtain calls, so we knew right then that we had a hit."
Regarding the banjo player, Darensbourg says, "At the recording session Jac=
k Kapp, the owner of the record company, and his son were there and they we=
ren't satisfied with 'Dolly'. 'You know what we ought to do on this thing? =
It needs something to pep it up a little.' Somebody in the band said, 'Why =
don't you try banjo. Put something in there in front, that's unusual, might=
 fit in.' They had a banjo player that lived close and they got hold of him=
. That's how that banjo part happened to come in there =96 just a second th=
ought. I think it helped the record some."
Which could imply that it was added later. But not Las Vegas. =

Very kind regards,
Bill. =
