Subject:[Dixielandjazz] Great HBO Treme this week - Mardi Gras Episode!
Just finished watching it - long performance by Tuba Skinny, and many other
local musicians throughout the hour + show.  (Famous and otherwise...)

If you have not been following the story, it may be a bit confusing - but
the music and fake Mardi Gras were very well done.
