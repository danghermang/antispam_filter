Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Luiz another less than competent display.
I did see the great things that Luiz did, and I applaud them. But with him, it is always a question about wether his moments of brilliance, that do come every game, will outweigh the accidents that are always waiting to happen, directly caused by him, and that always do happen.

Score lines in football are very different from what they are in eg team handball, or basketball. Most of the time, a period of possession - an attack at the opponents goal - will not lead to a goal. Therefore, a striker that makes nine silly mistakes, and then has one moment of greatness, can determine a game in a positive way for his team. In contrast, a central defender can do nine wonderful clearances and then have one sloppy moment, and his action may have decided the game in the wrong way.

It may well be that no-one was available for a pass when Luiz gave the ball away, I don't really know, but I find it a very poor excuse nevertheless.

However, I do agree that Luiz' moments of stupidity are becoming more scarce, but I think they are still far too frequent.
