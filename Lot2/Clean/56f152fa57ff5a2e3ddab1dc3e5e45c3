Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Les,

You're on the right track here.

The notion of a "capture area" is very abstract, and little related to 
practical concerns.

As a consequence, I fear that certain practical-minded folks have a rather 
inaccurate understanding of this abstract notion.

I'm sure you've gathered that I am an academic type who loves to debate 
endlessly about abstract notions, which are outside the interest of most 
participants to this forum.

However, I resent claims in this forum that misrepresent these abstract 
notions -- so I have been perhaps annoyingly persistent in discussing them.

You are completely correct that adding a ferrite to a loop antenna increases 
the voltage on the load -- which is what matters -- even if the abstract 
capture area is unchanged.

Gentlemen:

Please, take these hair splitting discussions to the more sophisticated 
forum. We are hams that like antennas.  Call me a simpleton if you will, but 
following the rather heated discussion about the definition of the capture 
area with or without ferrite did not add one iota to my of knowledge about 
antennas.

If the ferrite stick inserted into my antenna coil enhances the voltage, 
wow, that's good, it is what I want.

I don't mind the mental exercises such as falling flashlight explained 
either with the theory of relativity or the quantum theory, it is a good 
idea to keep one's mind occupied when the retirements lack of challenges 
sets in.
