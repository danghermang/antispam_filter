Subject:[burners] Hubway Data Visualization Challenge
The Hubway has recently issued an artistic design challenge for data visualization on the 1/2 million rides it has just released data for. 

The few entries so far look kinda lame. 

If your looking for something to do inside over the next two days, go make our community proud and participate. I'd love to see what some of you guys come up with. 

Might want to pass this on to CEMMI if they haven't seen it yet. The deadline is Oct 31st.
