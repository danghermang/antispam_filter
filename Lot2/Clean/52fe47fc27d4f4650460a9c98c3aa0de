Subject:[child_lit] middle school novels about hunger and emotional hunger
Morning Collective Brain,

Hope all of you are safe and warm.

My Sixth grade teachers are planning a unit on emotional hunger. Prior to
that unit, Sixth grade will be reading the young adult version of
Omnivore's Dilemma and exploring the issues there. They will also be
discussing child hunger (and perhaps doing some service learning related to
child hunger in NYC so if anyone can suggest a contact, please email me off
list) and I would like to provide a list of marvelous and challenging reads
where the main character is "emotionally hungry" or literally hungry.

Some books that have come to mind already are:
The Hunger Games
Living Up the Street: Essays by Gary Soto
Esperanza Rising
Leon's Story
Black Boy (but that might be a too mature for Sixth Grade)

What do you advise?

Looking forward to hearing from you.
