Subject:Re: [Hsqldb-user] Why using coalesce on a foreign key,
 results in a non executable statement ?
Hi Stephane,

This list is for announcements and simple questions.

The Help Forum is here for the type of questions that you ask:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb/forums/forum/73674

There is also an Open Discussion Forum on the same site for the
development of HSQLDB itself.

The main advantage of the Forum is to keep the thread of multiple posts
in one place.
