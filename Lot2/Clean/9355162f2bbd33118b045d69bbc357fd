Subject:[Flexradio] Having continued phone issues at FlexRadio today
To all,

Due to the recent devastation that was brought on by hurricane Sandy, we 
are still experiencing intermittent telephone issues that are preventing 
the completion of in and out-bound calls today.  We are aware of the 
problem and are working with our service provider to resolve the issue.  
If you cannot reach us by phone, please feel free to contact us via 
e-mail at sales@flexradio.com

Sorry for the inconvenience.

-Tim
