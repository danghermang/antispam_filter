Nvidia puts Tesla K20 GPU coprocessor through its paces
Early results on Hyper-Q, Dynamic Parallelism speedup

Back in May, when Nvidia divulged some of the new features of its
top-end GK110 graphics chip, the company said that two new features of
the GPU, Hyper-Q and Dynamic Parallelism, would help GPUs run more
efficiently and without the CPU butting in all the time. Nvidia is now
dribbling out some benchmark test results ahead of the GK110's shipment
later this year inside the Tesla K20 GPU coprocessor for servers.
