Interesting. Yes, I have noticed Mageia in Distrowatch. In fact when I
first started with Linux I settled on Mandrake, now Mandriva and used it
for years. Then I switched to Kubuntu, as much as anything because I got
fed up with the RPM system. I found the repository system so much
easier. Since then I have stayed with it.

Still, things may have changed since then, so I will have a look at
Mageia and see what I think.

Thanks

Neil
