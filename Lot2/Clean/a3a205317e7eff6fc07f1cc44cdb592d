Subject:[Jukebox-list] 2810 Issues
I bought an as-is 2810 jukwbox recently and need help sorting out some issu=
es.
=A0

First of all, The unit has a 544 amp instead of the 545 unit that book show=
s it should have. It is my understanding that it should wor though. Correct=
?
=A0

Second. When I turn the main power on, the lights work amd when the micro s=
witch to the left of the mute/play switches is depressed, the turntable mot=
or runs. Release it by hand and the turntable motor stops. Nothing else, ho=
wever, seems to cycle.=20
=A0

Third. Facing the back of machine, the right hand lift arm is in fully up p=
osition as if it is playing a record. The left hand lift arm is partially u=
p. The cam lobe on the mech is facing to back of machine. Cannot find a way=
 to retarct the arms. If I turn the knob on bottom of mech motor, the recor=
d rack wants to turn...so I stopped turning until I get advice on how to re=
tract arm.=20
=A0

Fourth. The mech motor has power (you can feel it vibrate) as verified with=
 tester. It does not, however, seem to have enough power to turn/cycle the =
mechanism
=A0

Last. There a one red wire dangling near the mute/play & micro switches> Ca=
n't find anywhere obvious that it shouild be terminated.
=A0

Any and all advice I can get would be greatly appreciated. The unit overall=
 is in very good condition. Cleaned up nicely

Best Regards
Tom Saxton
