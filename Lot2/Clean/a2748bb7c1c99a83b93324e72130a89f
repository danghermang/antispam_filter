Subject:[child_lit] African book exhibit
A few years back (maybe more like 10 years) someone on this list had an exh=
ibit of African children's books that had been on display that they were se=
lling.  I purchased it for the library at Salisbury University.  At some po=
int the list that identified the books as a collection was lost.  Now that =
we have a center for children's books I am trying to pull that collection b=
ack together but I only remember a few of the titles: Sosu=92s Call (1997),=
 The Magic Goat (1997) and Chipo and the Bird on the Hill: A Tale of Ancien=
t Zimbabwe (1984).  Does anyone remember having this collection... and perh=
aps a list of the books.  The main university library is willing to send th=
em all to me but they say they can't locate them without the titles.

Thanks,

Ernie
