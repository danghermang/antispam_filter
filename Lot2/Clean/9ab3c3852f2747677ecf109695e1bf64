 > I mean, how do some of you guys hear new music?

Easy: I visit Youtube, put the first word that comes to my mind in the search field and add "dubstep" behind. ;-)

Apart from that: still on vinyl. Dub is luckily still released on vinyl most of the time. I also get a lot of new 
releases as promo MP3 packages and if I like them I order the vinyl. If an artist only sends me a link to a snippet, I 
boycott the release. ;-)

 > I think there's definitely a return to vinyl these days.

In Germoney, vinyl sales hit the 1 million number last year if I recall correctly. That is not much, but it is only the 
official number from the official shops for new releases. They never asked me how many records I sold. ;-)

 > I'm in the process of starting a record label and much advice [...] was if you want to stand out from the swathes of 
releases out there then physical product is one way of doing this.

If you have the money, make a 180 g release with a 4/4 colour album cover with great artwork, add some little vinyl 
secrets (e. g. a "hidden" bonus track) and - very important - add a free download code for the digital version. Then put 
it up on Bandcamp (and your usual distribution ways). Good luck. :-)

 > the ubiquitous "DJ with laptop"

Terrible. I lived in Finland this summer and some reggae sounds there only used laptops. It was ridiculous. Juggling 
MP3s as if they were 7"es... The most horrible was in Helsinki: A Swiss DJ used a vinyl record to control the MP3s on 
his laptop via USB. No idea how it worked but the MP3 started when he put down the needle, he could scratch, pull up, 
everything. If I wouldn't have stood behind the desks, I wouldn't have realised he is not playing vinyls. What a fraud!

This would be so awesome! Even now as I am older I still go with Homer Simpson who said "Singing is the lowest form of 
communication." Being able to simply turn off the vocals with one click... a dream would come true! I often hear a song 
that sounds great - until the vocals starts. Then I search for an instrumental version of it. Sometimes I am lucky 
(thanks to Karaoke). Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh4oP-skGcc Rihanna "Man Down" - Rihanna = great reggae.
