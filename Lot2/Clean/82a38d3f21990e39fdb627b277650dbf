Subject:Re: [EVDL] Karma carnage
The ones that were separate from the burned group look just fine. If 
submersion caused the fire due to some problem or defect, they all 
would have burned since they all were submerged.

I'll guess that one caught fire and then the fire spread to the 
others. They all contain gasoline, so they will all burn if ignited.

It is not inconceivable that someone set the first one on fire deliberately.
