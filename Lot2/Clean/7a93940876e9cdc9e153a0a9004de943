My reading as a child is probably atypical for a couple of reasons. First, =
I'm older than most of you; I started school in 1946. Second, I was raised =
in rural Mississippi, nobody's idea of a "normal" location. I was a big fan=
 of the series on childhoods of famous Americans. I also read as much of Lo=
uisa May Alcott as I could get my hands on, some of Mark Twain, and--I amus=
e myself recalling this--movie magazines. I don't even know whether they pu=
blish magazines like Photoplay any more, but I was a very star-struck kid, =
and I read all the ones I could get my hands on. For years I was something =
of an authority on movie trivia--want to know who Robert Taylor married aft=
er his divorce from Barbara Stanwyck? I know. (Most of you won't even recal=
l who that pair was, now do you?) We had bookmobile service at my little co=
untry school, and we were allowed to check out a certain number of books. T=
he teacher was also allowed to check out a supply for the individual
 classroom. I read all of mine, all the ones for the classroom, and borrowe=
d from my classmates when I'd read all those. Nancy Drew? I once read a Nan=
cy Drew in 45 minutes, because that was all the time I was allowed with it.=
 Hardy Boys books--yup, when I ran out of Nancy Drews, I'd stoop to Hardy B=
oys. I found an Alcott titled Jack and Jill at my grandmother's house. She =
gave it to me, and I must have read it 15 times. We didn't have access to a=
 library in the summer, so I had to make do with what I had. One of my gran=
dmothers got copies of Grit, and she saved those for me. (She used to stitc=
h them together with basting thread so that they'd have all their pages whe=
n I got to them.) We had magazine subscriptions--Ladies' Home Journal would=
 run serialized versions of novels, and I read all of those. We got Life ma=
gazine, and I liked that. I drew the line at TIME magazine; that was just f=
lat boring. Fortunately, my parents were big on reading. Their
 encouragement undoubtedly urged me on to the teaching path I ultimately ad=
opted.

Subject: [child_lit] An African-American friend asks who read what?
  =

I have an African-American net-friend in New Jersey, who has been a music t=
eacher, a computer techie and, I gather recently, a librarian. He recently =
posted the following musings on Facebook.=A0 He gave me permission to repos=
t his comments anonymously to Childlit, and asked me to let him know what t=
he response was.

"I=A0 was playing "Draw Something" with a friend of mine, and unable to dra=
w the item, she gave me the hint of "Lion, Witch, & ___." I immediately gue=
ssed WARDROBE, but then I got to thinking. No, not about the written hints,=
 but about the assumptions of what books we've either read or know about.

Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and the like were books I had never heard of unt=
il I got to college, where they seemed to pop up in the conversations of ot=
her people. In fact, I clearly remember that my first encounter with Tolkie=
n was through the Harvard Lampoon parody "Bored of the Rings," which I pick=
ed up somewhere=A0 during the summer of 76. I found it so hilarious, even w=
ithout getting most of the references, that I decided I had to read the ori=
ginals.

Insert sound of crickets chirping here.

I was fairly well-educated. I read voraciously. I was in the CP track of my=
 public high school and graduated in the top 5% of my class, but had never =
heard of any of these books or authors. What was going on?

Two possibilities strike me. The first is that while those books are well-k=
nown, they're well-known to a certain subset of people. They're not the boo=
ks that 90% of us grew up reading or having read to us.

The other possibility, and quite frankly, the one that came to mind first, =
is that these just weren't books that the average African-American kid had =
ever heard of or cared about. They weren't books that their parents had eve=
r heard of, and hence, weren't books that were read to them by their parent=
s. And for those of you who forget=A0 (or didn't know in the first place), =
my high school was 99% black.

Or...maybe it was just me. Maybe while *I* was sitting at home, reading=A0 =
everything I could get my hands on by Jean Shepherd (and therefore knew=A0 =
"You'll shoot your eye out" a good 10 years before most of the rest of you)=
, the rest of my classmates actually *were* reading Tolkien and Lewis.

I'm interested in this both personally and as a librarian.

And now that I think about it, I wonder how popular the Harry Potter series=
 has been among black kids."

So those are his ideas. Let me know what you think.
