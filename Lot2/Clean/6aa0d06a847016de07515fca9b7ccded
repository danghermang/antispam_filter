Subject:[Birding-Aus] Pt Lookout, North Stradbroke Island, SE Qld
Hi All

Super strong southeasterly winds demanded attention on Sunday, but I
didn't get to the point until 11.00 due to prior commitments.
Thousands of Short-tailed and Wedge-tailed Shearwater streamed south in
a continous flow against the howling wind. A lone Pomarine Skua, a
single Brown Booby and about a dozen Common Noddies seemed to be the
only 'other' species passing, however, there may have been Sooty
Shearwaters among the flocks - the light was quite harsh and variable
due to changing cloud cover and so wing flash was difficult to analyse,
the erratic flight patterns as the birds battled the wind didn't help
either.
The definite highlight of the day was a very poor view, as it hurtled
north high above the sea, of a Red-footed Booby - follow up id confirmed
suspicions on site.
Another observer reported a White-winged Black Tern and Black Noddies on
Saturday and the Noddies again, and probable Sooty Shearwater, prior to
my arrival on Sunday. (Thanks Andy)

The water taxi trip back to Cleveland was.........interesting!

Cheers
