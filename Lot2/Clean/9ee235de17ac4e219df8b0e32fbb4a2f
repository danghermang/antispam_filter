Subject:Re: [Dixielandjazz] 1st Mardi Gras Gig
Why guess? Ask what style of dancing they want.

"Over the Waves" and "While We Danced At the Mardi Gras" were both written 
in 3/4 but also can be done in 4/4.

And almost anything by Irving Berlin, Harry Warren, Walter Donaldson, the 
ODJB, the Hot 5/7, or the Henderson/DeSylva/Brown team can be done by your 
instrumentation.

As for uniform, since this is a dinner/dance not an afternoon beer party, 
how about dark trousers and matching jackets, shirts, and ties?

I am booking my first Mardi Gras gig, and I am not sure if there is anything
I should know.

The event is a Mardi Grass dinner dance, and they have requested that we
play some "dance" tunes in addition to Dixieland tunes.  I am assuming they
are talking about swing dance tunes.  Any thoughts on what tunes would work
with clarinet/trumpet/trombone/tuba/banjo?

We do use the striped vest/straw hat thing for regular gigs.  Is that
appropriate for Mardi Gras?  If not, what might be a better choice?
