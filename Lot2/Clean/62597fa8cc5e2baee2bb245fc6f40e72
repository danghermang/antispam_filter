Subject:Re: [Coral-List] Goliath Grouper encounters
I would suggest that few people, marine conservationists and scientists
included, apply the look but don't touch approach in all cases. We should
not need to use direct contact to make our point in education, but
invariably it often ends up as part of the mix. As Steve points out it is
human nature to want to 'reach out' when something extraordinary crosses our
path. I too have done this with dugongs, dolphins, wolf eels and moray eels.
I am also guilty of even doing it with crinoid 'feet' and the occasional
anemone. I would propose that instead of rejecting this basic response in
ourselves that we take every opportunity where it does present itself to be
explicit in our message to the audience that it does not represent a green
light to do it everywhere in all cases. Case in point would be divers under
the care of a group leader, although I'm sure we can all recount stories of
how some instructor or divemaster did this or that to some poor reef
resident. Public education facilities that have 'touch tanks' and scientific
research that involves handling marine life is generally done under somewhat
more controlled conditions than if Joe public does it in the wild.
'Touching' other animals is part of life. Some would argue a very necessary
part of life. Our job is to create awareness to mitigate irresponsible
contact.

To bring it back to coral I would say that this marine animal, in contrast
to the vast majority of others, suffers the most from contact. But like
other groups of animals, this one also has a wide range of tolerance across
the many species and growth forms. But to send a message that some can be
touched and some others not, would be detrimental to coral on the whole. So
instead we take the the look but don't touch approach in our education
message for all coral.

The Goliath video is excellent. I'm not saying the touching may not have
'some' impact, but it does not detract from the "I care" message of this
clip that Steve accurately points out. Sure it would have been very good to
have an additional paragraph of notes on the video explaining the conditions
under which a goliath grouper can be touched, and maybe it will be included
next time. But to pull the video from youtube? No way.
