Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Hi Clemens

Thanks for looking up the figures in the CCIR report, I think
CCIR-670?  I feel that a communications systems are normally designed
for minimum external noise, and I should have made that clear.
Obviously it's highly variable and can be 40-50 dB higher than the
minimum value.  I was quoting from memory - is the minimum noise value
around +50 dB?

A point to remember is that while comms systems should be designed to
detect minimum external noise, broadcast systems work on a much higher
noise floor.
