Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] Lisa Webber's is a meteorite
There is a deep divide between meteorite hunters, hobbyists, etc and  
the scientists.  It wasn't always that way - the Meteoritical Society  
was originally formed by a group of scientists, hobbyists, and in  
general a gaggle of folks with widely varying backgrounds who shared  
an interest in meteorites. I think it would benefit everyone if the  
Society were able to regain that shared body of knowledge. I think  
this episode with the Novato meteorite/wrong/riteagain illustrates the  
need for a truly inclusive Society. Or perhaps for an entirely new  
society that values acceptance of people with a range of interests and  
experience levels, to include the general public.

Cheers,
Marc Fries
