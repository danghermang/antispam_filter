Subject:[meteorite-list] OT- Hurricane Sandy
Hello everyone,

Last year, for hurricane Irene, some people on the list gave us some
great links to weather radar maps around NY City and Long Island.
I am traveling and have those links only on my home computer.

Could someone please give me these links again ?
Thank you !

Wishing everybody in Sandy's path to be safe....
Michael B.
