Subject:Re: [EVDL] Ceramic Heater elements
Instead of cutting up the old heater core, I bent up a sheet metal 
holder/spacer for the ceramic element. This was the same overall size 
as the heater core, and had holes in the right place for the ceramic 
element. Kind of like a metal picture frame, if you can imagine.

It is likely that Scott could fashion a holder, perhaps sheet metal, 
that positioned a standard ceramic element at a diagonal so it would 
fit inside the heater housing. It does not have to fit exactly in the 
same place as the original heater core. It just has to fit in a way 
that the air is forced through it.
