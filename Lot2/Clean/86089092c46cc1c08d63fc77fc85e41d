Subject:[Birding-Aus] FNQ Sightings -Buff-breasted Paradise-Kingfisher
Hi folks,
Buff-breasted Paradise-Kingfisher returned the day after PhilGregory 
reported he had seen none at the Lodge, on the 31st October.
They are not all back with only two birds being seen, last year we had 7 
pairs nesting in the lodge grounds which was one more than the previous 
six years.
More information can be found here:

Cheers,
Keith & Lindsay.

A new and perhaps unwelcome local species for me was a Eurasian Starling on
flooded fields just north of Brady's Lagoon (which is north of Mareeba) on
Oct 28.

Cassowary and 3 chicks doing well at Black Mt Road, and the big female was
in today looking much better then when I saw her looking tatty and exhausted
about a month ago, her bald patches have healed up well.

Still 2 Radjah Shelduck at Cairns Centenary Lakes, feeding with Black Ducks
and both Magpie and Feral geese from a tourist giving out bread.

No Buff-breasted Paradise Kingfisher yet, the early ones look to have gone
through but i heard none at Kingfisher Park, Black Mt Road Kuranda or
Daintree on Oct 30.

A couple of Black Bittern and 3 nests of Papuan Frogmouth on Sauce's
Daintree river cruise.

Maryfarms had about 6 Aus Bustards, 5 Aus Pratincoles and about 8 Diamond
Doves along the West Mary Road on Oct 30.
