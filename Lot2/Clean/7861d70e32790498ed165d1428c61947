Well, I need control over the invoked executables and flags for
specific languages - especially for integrating it into Config::AutoConf
and do other multi-compile stages (as Net::Radio::Location::SUPL::Test
requires first ASN.1 -> C compile stage, then C -> object, then link
into *.so).

I looked into EU::B and I didn't see that I get full control for
those requirements, but I might be pebcak and not a limitation of
EU::B ;)
