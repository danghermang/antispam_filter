Hi everyone - 

As coincidence would have it, many of you are riding in Gettysburg on this
gorgeous weekend! Please respond to Jerry with any recommendations.  Thanks!

Hi,

I'm a 60+ year old cyclist who is considering a move to someplace in
southcentral PA, like the Gettysburg area. Because I ride a hi-racer
recumbent (Bacchetta), I'd prefer an area without lots of 10-15% grades. 
Can you tell me what the terrain is like out there?

Also, are there any other riding clubs closer to that area who might have
more local info?

Thanks for any help.
