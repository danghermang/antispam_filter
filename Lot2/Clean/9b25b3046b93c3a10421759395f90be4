Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Torres
I was going to disagree violently with your opening paragraph until I
realised you said "Championships" not "the Championship" as that's about
the standard he is (hoho)

While 3rd, three points behind, isn't so bad as far as the season goes,
compared to 1st and 4 points ahead a month ago it's not good at all,
though I fully accept we're not playing badly, just lacking a certain
freshness that the ability to rotate would bring. I agree neither
Sturridge nor Lukaku are the solution, but we would lose absolutely
nothing by rotating up front as we're getting nothing right now.

I've been calling Torres the original false-9 on twitter for some
months, so I'll happily accept that name. Hazard, as well, is struggling
after a good start and needs the opportunity to come on late against a
tiring team. I admit to being baffled by the consistent substitution of
Oscar first of all just as he seems to be coming more into the game, but
rotation and substitutions apply to him just as well, I guess.

The stories about FL & JT not having their contracts renewed is all well
and good in the longer term, but we currently have Marin sitting on the
bench (sometimes) without even a minute in the last COCup game v Utd and
only a short time in the earlier round v Wolves. De Bruyne is doing very
well in Germany but I don't know in what way he'll be used when he does
come back to us, whenever that is.

Maybe being at the top of the table has been a distraction and we need
to use this season as a proper transitional one, forcing us to use these
options to see where it takes us. 3rd is an acceptable finish in that
context, but burning out players when we know we have 7 games in
November & 9 in December won't tell us anything we need to have sorted
out by the crunch part of this season.

Harry
