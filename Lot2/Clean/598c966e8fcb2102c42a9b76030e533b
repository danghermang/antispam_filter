Subject:[CT Birds] Juvenile Red Headed Woodpecker
Juv RHWO first appeared as a "mystery bird" for me last Thursday. Yesterday,
I had much better looks and was able to get pictures so John Marshall was
able to verify the bird for me. Bird visited the feeders all day yesterday
but have only heard its 

rattle so far today. I am amazed that it is here in this "barely suburban"
area.
