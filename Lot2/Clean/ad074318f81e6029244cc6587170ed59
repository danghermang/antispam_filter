and it's an excellent book with brilliant retellings of Grimm and sensitive,
perceptive and scholarly notes. The book is a master class in Grimm and in
retelling fairy tales. It's also a departure for Pullman. We see him working
in a tighter frame. Rather than transforming the story into a rich embroidery
of Pullman-esque fantasy (Puss in Boots, for example), he has transformed
himself into a kind of restorer, rescuing stories from the damage of passing
years. But perhaps that's too sedate a metaphor for this book. It might be
better to suggest a musician performing early music (L'Arpeggiata , perhaps?)
and balancing authenticity against contemporary musical tastes: the overall
frame is Grimm, but there are plenty of flourishes of Pullman's exquisite
sense of irony and compassion and absurd humor, which make one rethink Grimm
or the possibilities of reading Grimm. It's astonishingly good--but no
surprise there.

Esteemed list member Philip Pullman has a new book out which I, for one, 
can't wait to read. Bet the rest of you will covet it as well. (Probably 
everybody but me already knew about it.) Excellent news, in any case!
