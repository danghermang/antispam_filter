Subject:[mat-wg] New Statistics Dashboard on RIPE Labs
[apologies for duplicates]

Dear colleagues,

Following up from the list of statistics we published on RIPE Labs 
recently, we created a statistics dashboard that shows many 
automatically updated graphs and allows you to search for certain topics 
by tags:

https://labs.ripe.net/statistics/

If you have any comments or suggestions, please do not hesitate to let 
me know.

Kind regards,
Mirjam Kuehne
