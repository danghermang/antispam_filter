Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Heil Proset Elite RX & TX Eq settings suggestions?
Hi Zack

I would start with the Heil profile you have, and then go through the audio
chain alignment.  I would also keep the EQ flat as the Heil mics have
already been eq'd so to speak for SSB communications.

I am sure you have read this:

Also, don't hesitate to email Heil and ask them about their recommendations
for a Flex.  They helped me with my remote base setup on eq.

I've been a big fan of  Heil mics since the 90's and have used nothing but.
 I am pretty sure you will find it a great addition to the 5000.
