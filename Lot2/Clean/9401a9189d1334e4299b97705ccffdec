Hear, Hear!  Everything needed was available, the hotel was most accommodating and pleasant, and the riding was great (except for the wind....).  Thanks to Linda and all the hard-working helpers.-Barbara

> Thank you Linda, Jim, and all of the other volunteers who put together another great fall foliage weekend to Gettysburg.  There were rides of all levels and distances and the countryside was beautiful.  Many Hanover Bike Club Cyclists lead or helped with the rides and one even had a video camera attached to the top of his helmet and took videos while we were riding.  Linda, he said he would forward them to post. A tour of the battlefield by Nancy including Dr. Dave supplying history comments was another highlight. The food was delicious and the dinner on Friday included Cheeseman Howie Weiner with a wider selection than ever.  The dinner at Altman House was very tasty.  Linda took care of every detail.  She even provided perfect weather.  Thanks again, Linda.
