Subject:[Birding-Aus] No Franklins Gull
Gooday all on BA

 

Judy and I raced down to Paynevilles over the weekend to try for the
Franklins Gull. We showed up, the gull didn't. The waiting time on Saturday
afternoon and Sunday morning was filled in with talk and fun with an
interesting group of about 20 other birders. I cannot remember most of their
names but Peter, Rhonda, Albert, Eleanor, Kay and Doogal come to mind.
