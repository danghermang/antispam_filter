Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Theft of archives - update
As an update on Rosie's request for help yesterday on who might have =

displayed our private list archives to an open site, we have succeeded =

in taking down the site and now hot on the trail of the offender. The =

host of that site understood the problem and seriousness of the =

offense and cooperated immediately.

We know how the couple of thousand messages where placed there. It was =

taken by a person who logged in and took copies without asking =

permission. Thus, we have purged the member list of the A-D archives, =

leaving in some selected members. The rest have been removed and if =

any on this list are members, just re-register.

Thanks to those, on and offlist, who tried to politely and kindly =

help.....

BTW: We frequently receive requests to use some of our material and =

permission is usually granted if it serves a good purpose. Some are =

for translation into other languages. We don't mind sharing if at =

least we are asked permission to do so first.
