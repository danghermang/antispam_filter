I also find it interesting that under the current proposed end-user restructuring,
a small multihomer that has a /23, a /24, and a /48 with an ASN would have
their fees quadruple from $100/year to $400/year while a very large corporate
legacy holder (e.g. Apple, HP, MIT) that still refuses to sign the LRSA or 
ANY RSA would have their fees remain at $0.

Perhaps it would be worth while to consider as part of this fee restructuring:

1.	Removing the fee exemption for legacy holders.
and/or
2.	Basing the fees on total address holdings rather than number of blocks.
