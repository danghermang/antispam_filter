Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Another Crystal Radio Question
Jose

My experiments with crystal radios from the age of 8 also show that
they need a fairly large wire antenna.  I think that is the experience
of anyone with hands-on experience.  We also understand theoretically
why that should be so.

We were diverted by suggestions of crystal sets with ferrite rod
antennas, but actually the ferrite rod coils are only tuning coils and
they still need a wire antenna to work.
