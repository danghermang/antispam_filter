I had some RF issues with my very compromised OCF.    I made one of these a=
nd put it in line.  RF
issues no more (and I still get out!)

Subject: Re: [Flexradio] RFI on 10 meter


Have been out from home for some days now, but I'm back, and have just rewi=
red the Mic. Works fine
on all bands except 15 and 10 meters. It's not so bad on 15 meters, but 10 =
meter is really bad.  I
know my antenna is out of tune on 10 meters, but it's not even supported on=
 12, 17 and 6 meters,
and there are no problems there.

Have tried ferrite bead on the mic cable, but does not seem to make any dif=
ference.

Check the wiring on the mic cable.  If it is a Heil cable, the MIC- and gro=
und may be bonded
(connected) together (they should not be connected) and the ground/cable sh=
ield may not be
connected to the shell of the 8-pin Foster connector (which it should).



Then try a ferrite bead on the mic cable.
