Subject:Re: [Chelsea] CPO Share Application Form
Sent the application from the website (for me, our club and a few friends) 
on Friday and already today (as expected) got this email:

> We need
> to see photo ID and a document showing proof of address for everyone
> before we can issue your shares. You can scan and email the 
> documents to us via email to save time if you prefer.

So no mention of any queue to issue shares (we requested one share each). 
I'll be reporting what happens when I have sent the documents.
