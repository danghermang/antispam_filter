OPPORTUNITY UPDATE:  Survey Of 'Matijevic Hill' Continues  - sols
3111-3117, Oct. 24, 2012-Oct. 30, 2012:

Opportunity has completed approximately half of the local area survey
around the location called Matijevic Hill (named in honor of Jake
Matijevic) at the inboard edge of Cape York on the rim of Endeavour
Crater. 

The rover performed three survey drives on Sols 3112, 3114 and 3117
(Oct. 25, 27 and 30, 2012), driving 98 feet (30 meters) west, 30 feet (9
meters) north, and 108 feet (33 meters) south, respectively.  Each drive
was preceded by the collection of targeted imagery and then followed by
taking a 360-degree Navigation camera (Navcam) panorama. 

The plan ahead is to conduct more survey drives around this location. 

As of Sol 3116 (Oct. 29, 2012), the solar array energy production was
549 watt-hours with an atmospheric opacity (Tau) of 0.649 and a solar
array dust factor of 0.601.

Total odometry is 21.90 miles (35,261.66 meters).
