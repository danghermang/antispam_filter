Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Revealed: Amazing details of 'bar brawl' in ref
	Clattenburg's room at Chelsea [Mirror]
It's pretty clear this comes from the ref's version of events, maybe
combined with someone in the corridor who only saw the comings and
goings. There appears to have been lots of briefing going on today, with
Dermot Gallagher getting interviewed after speaking directly to
Clattenburg by phone, so this is the case for the defence. If you read
the comments from Prospect, the refs union, they're actually absurd, but
that's all peripheral.

The Times report says CFC have just taken witness statements from
players today and won't formally be interviewed by the FA until later in
the week, which means the PR battle is rather one-sided. Very little on
CFC's side appears to have come out.

As for JT's involvement, such as it is, it's neither here nor there. His
name is just a red flag in this piece.

Harry
