Hi Jim:


In my opinion for the most part yes,  however there are some events and gigs that certain players fit the requirements better than others that may be regulars and even better players on some repertoire.  And it is also difficult when a good group has several band leaders in it that book conflicting gigs and compete with each other for almost all gigs.   Musicians can and often are even more fickle than the public and grow tired of playing the same repertoire all the time, and of course have fall outs with other players for various reasons as well causing themselves to quit or get fired :))    


Remember the old saying:  "Musicians spend 90% of their lives trying to get a gig, and the other ten % trying to get fired from it."    It's sounds funny but there is  indeed a lot of truth in it .


The band lineup is almost always subject to the budget allowed for the band and in the case of The Sac. Jubilee, often how many other bands that top player may be performing with.   It is difficult to show up with exactly the same players for most Professional Working bands, because of the scarcity of good paying gigs in this genre to support high caliber bands year round.


Many festivals still believe that more mediocre bands that will work for mediocre wages are better than hiring better known and higher caliber bands for more money even though they draw better and sell more tickets to wider audiences elsewhere.  Quantity over quality almost always prevails.   This also drives higher caliber bands away from the circuit as well because they can't make a living playing these kind of events.   Hence more and more Hobbyist bands.  


Cheers,


Tom Wiggins

All:

Re: Same musicians live & recordings? As a non-musician festival director, I 
suppose it's a truth in advertising issue.

I have not seen it as much lately, but several years ago, bands would add 
ringers or extra people for the Sacramento Jubilee (name at the time). So 
when hiring them for a subsequent festival it was always necessary to ask 
and nail down who the band personnel will be.

FWIW
