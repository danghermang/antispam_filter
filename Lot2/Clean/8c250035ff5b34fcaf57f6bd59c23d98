Subject:[Flexradio] VoiceKeyer v5.0.3 Released
VoiceKeyer v5.0.3 has been released & is available for download from my
website.

I think I finally got rid of the pesky bug where the program would get into
an endless loop if the hardware is not fully set up when you close the
Hardware Setup window.  Also found & fixed a bug where the program would not
start up in its saved position on the screen.
