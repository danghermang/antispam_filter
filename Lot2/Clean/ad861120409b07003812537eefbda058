It was aimed at me, I'm afraid!  And this is what prompted it...

" 'The standard' is NOT 6kw - you are just peddling the same get-rich-quick nonsense that the 'industry' insists on without any justification for doing so.

Most people just need a regular 110V socket, or 240V at a pinch, combined with a proper, country-wide network of high-power, DC, fast chargers at 50kW+ - like Tesla's Supercharger Network.

MW "  ...

... and his reply ...

"You missed the point, the larger chargers allow you to charge at a Level 2 or
Level 1 charger. It would be rude for a EV to take up a long time at a
public charger using 110vac and maybe 6amp. I can tell you don't use the
public chargers, cause this is a real problem and it still boils down to
money. ..."

And my response...

'Cruisin', or what ever your real name is; Are you seriously suggesting that someone is going to come back to their car from work or wherever, halfway through the day and move their EV once it has finished charging so some-one else can use the charger? I'm sorry, but that is a hopelessly unrealistic model for public EVSE use.

I stand by my original statement that the only way this EV thing is going to work in a mass-market context is for nigh-on *every* parking space - whether it be in a supermarket car park, a railway station car park, in a parking bay for a block of flats (condos), or outside your house (for those without off-street parking) or what-ever other scenario you can think off - to have its own EVSE.  Now that could be of any type but probably post mounted or inductive pad-type. On top of that there *must* be a nation-wide network of DC fast chargers rated at 50kW or more, put in place by law and installed/serviced by the private sector but overseen by the government.  

If you accept that (and I don't expect that you do!) then clearly it is pointless having an on-board charger capable of more than 2-3kW as you will always be parked long enough to provide a full charge/top up and the extra cost of providing more power will be a waste of money for everyone.

If you do your charging at home, then *all you need* is a standard 110V or 240V socket with GFI and weather-proofed if appropriate.  You do *not* need to spend $1000 on installing a pretty EVSE.  If you do the math, the $1000 you spend on your EVSE will pay for all the electricity your EV is likely to use in its lifetime!

Lastly, and I appreciate this is a bit of a personal dig, you clearly do not understand that no-one with any sense is going to listen to what you have to say unless you are prepared to put your name to it.

Incidentally, I'd love to pop round and visit for a chat but I'm in...
