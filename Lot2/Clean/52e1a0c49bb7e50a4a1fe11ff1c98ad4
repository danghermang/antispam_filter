Subject:[Ubuntu-be] updates wiki ubuntu-be
Hello,

At the last ubuntu-be gathering in Houthalen we have done some updates 
on the wiki of ubuntu-be.

What are these updates :
-    changed the USB-project page and added links to download them,
         https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BelgianTeam/LocalizedUSB
-    Updated the "Fairs" page, because it was outdated and made the 
report of the last dipro-fair in Hasselt,
         https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BelgianTeam/ComputerFairs
-    added Information brochure ubuntu 12.04LTS in Dutch,
         https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BelgianTeam/PromotionMaterial

The only thing that didn't work was the uploads of the ISO's to the wiki.
The ISO's are 1,3gb in size and i think that they are to big for the 
wiki pages, i've done 3 attempts and they all failed.
For now i added the links to my ubuntu-one account?

Is there a way to make the ubuntu-be ISO's available from the ubuntu-be 
website?
Can someone make the changes to the website and add them?

grtz,
Claudio
