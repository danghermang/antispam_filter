So what happens when your customer leaves or gets into a dispute with you?
 Is the PA assignment your IP address or theirs?

If it's yours when they leave you, then it's not provider independent. This
is the way that most LIRs operate: PA assignments are valid as long as the
end user is a customer of the provider.  Once they move to another provider
and stop taking services from you, then the address assignment is no longer
theirs.

This is what provider independent means.  Anyone can multihome a /24 from
an allocated block, but it will still remain part of a PA allocation.
