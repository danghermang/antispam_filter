Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Alan,

My attitude remains that you are misusing the term "capture area".

As I reconstruct your view, you consider that when a ferrite is added to a 
loop antenna, one should compare the performance of the antenna with the 
ferrite AND tuned by a tuning capacitor to the performance without the 
ferrite AND without the tuning capacitor.

It is true that without the tuning capacitor, the antenna captures very 
little power.   You say that this antenna, with no tuning capacitor has a 
very low "capture area".

OK.

If you add the ferrite, but still leave out the tuning capacitor, the 
antenna still captures very little power.  In fact, it captures less power 
than before the ferrite was added, and has an even smaller capture area.

If you now add the tuning capacitor, and tune it, the antenna now captures a 
lot of power, and its capture area is
3 lambda^2 / 4 pi (in your way or reporting this, and 3 lambda^2 / 8 pi in 
my way of reporting it).

However, if you had added the tuning capacitor to the  the original loop 
antenna without the ferrite -- and used it to tune the antenna, the antenna 
would also have captured a lot of power, and its capture area would also be
3 lambda^2 / 4 pi (in your way or reporting this, and 3 lambda^2 / 8 pi in 
my way of reporting it).

In view of all this, should we say that adding the ferrite "increased the 
capture area"?

The answer depends on "compared to what"?

There is no change compared to the best capture area without the antenna, 
but there is a change compared to any other scenario in which the antenna 
with or without the ferrite is "mistuned".

-------------
So, I agree that adding a ferrite can increase the capture area of a 
"mistuned" antenna, but it does not increase the capture area of a "tuned" 
antenna (although the "tuning" is different with and without the ferrite).

I say (as did Alan P, and as does Collin) that adding the ferrite does NOT 
change the capture area, because we all compare the capture area with the 
ferrite to the maximum capture area without the ferrite.

You say that adding the ferrite increases the capture area because you 
compare the capture area of a tuned antenna with a ferrite to the capture 
area of an untuned antenna without it.

---------------------- 
----------------------
You may be confusing capture area (i.e, power captured from the incident 
wave), with the output power from the receiver amplifier.  If the amplifier 
is a voltage amplifier, its output power depends on the input voltage and 
NOT on the input power that was captured from the wave.

The ferrite increases the input voltage, but not the input power.    The 
output power of the amplifier is increased by the ferrite in this case. 
However, the term "capture area" is NOT used to characterize the output 
power of the amplifier.

--------------------------
I have said these things consistently starting with my first email comments 
on Alan P's article, in which I warned of the danger of misuse of the term 
"capture area".

I have suggested that you don't take my word for this, but consult the book 
of Collin that you often refer to.   That book agrees with what I have been 
saying here, as I explained in a previous email.

You have consistently misused the term "capture area" in your contributions 
to this thread.    I acknowledge that we are not making progress now in this 
thread.

I have tried "spoon feeding" you on this, but you seem to find the 
"medicine" bitter, and spit it out.
I can wish that you "get well quick", but I am skeptical that this will 
happen unless you "take your medicine".

Well, you had a chance but you are going off on a tangent again.  It
doesn't matter to me whether you think I am right or wrong.  I see you
are choosing to redefine capture area  again - incorrectly - and
generating another smokescreen in the process.  I don't think the
learning process should be based on spoon-feeding so we'll leave it
for a while until my motivation improves . . I really don't think
anyone else is very much interested in this :).
