	and IGBT
I am using a 403CNQ400
so 400V, 400A
I do not expect the voltage to be the problem
as these are the freewheel diodes - they see
the voltage across the motor, never more than 130V.

EVT15 is a transistor based control,

Hopefully that link will bring up the schematic and elementary diagram
of the 
control.
What voltage are the Schottky diodes?
The layout of that control was poor allowing high parasitic inductance.
While 
switching high
current the voltage overshoot is quite high, I would expect almost
double the 
pack voltage.
That control was designed for a 9" GE motor wound for 96V.  What is the 
nameplate voltage
of the 11" motor?  Current limit on that control is software regulated,
not 
hardware, so it's possible
peak currents during acceleration are quite high.

P.S. GE also made an EVT100, which is a transistor based EV100 (SCR
based).
These were special IGBT's made for GE by IR back in the early 90's and
are rated 
at 250V

Now I might be mistaken here, but I thought the GE EV100 used an *SCR*
as
the switch, not an IGBT... 

Here is a link to a manual I found when I searched for "GE EV100
controlller":

http://www.fsip.biz/Documents/EV100ZX%20%20TECH.pdf

Is that it?
