Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] 1/2-wave vertical really needs a ground
 plane?
I can definitely testified to the fact that a vertical half-wave, centre =

fed not attached to ground, does not need wires in the ground.

Back during (Solar Cycle 21) I worked 125 countries with 10 watt's on
10 m.  using this antenna.  The feed point was slightly less than =BD =

wavelength above ground.
It also had a local night time communication range of more than 50 air
miles and a mobile to base range of about 30 air miles.
