Subject:[Flexradio] FLEX-1500 XVTR drive level
The FLEX-1500 manual states:

(3) Transverter Transmit or Common Port (XVTX/C)
This is the transverter transmit, or transverter common (both transmit and receive) connection. The
output level equals 0 dBm at a drive level setting of 30. Use the Antenna Form to select whether this
port is to be used as a Transmit Only, Transmit and Receive or auxiliary Receive port.

Is there data on output levels for drive level settings other than 30, e.g., 40, 50, 60 ...?
