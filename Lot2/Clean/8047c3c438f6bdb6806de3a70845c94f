   Hello braun as Welcome to this Tech Resources update from The Register

   Unified Storage Consolidation for Microsoft Windows Installations
   http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9d4/5613a/4ea/060017ec?td=3Dm_wpe=
_h

      Unified storage is infrastructure that supports multiple types of
      storage within a single management framework. In an ideal scenario, an
      admin can access a single set of tools and functions that are
      transparent to the type of storage used.

      The specific business case analysis detailed in this paper compares a
      base case of a varied number of storage solutions with a unified
      storage solution for a Wikibon Reference Organization with revenues of
      $250 million, 1,000 staff, and an IT budget of $7.5 million.

Transforming Virtualized Infrastructure
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9ea/5613a/4ea/c36c24a2?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   As private clouds gain traction, the industry will see continuing
   strong momentum for virtualizing mission-critical applications sourced
   from key suppliers such as Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP. Virtualization
   is at the core of an efficient, manageable private cloud
   infrastructure. While the initial driver to virtualize has been cost
   savings, increasingly the focus is on improvements to performance,
   service quality, and availability. What IT organizations have come to
   realize is that the underlying infrastructure, particularly storage,
   plays a key role in successfully realizing the benefits of a
   virtualized environment that supports enterprise applications.

Endpoint security - pressures and priorities
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9f8/5613a/4ea/a1ba81bd?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Organisations are struggling to keep pace with the changing security
   needs and demands of their user base. Well established trends such as
   the move to mobile and flexible working and the consumerisation of IT
   mean that there is increasing pressure on organisations to open up
   their infrastructure to end users who want to bring their own devices -
   be they tablets, netbooks, laptops or smartphones - to work. Managing
   the security needs of such an environment means there needs to be
   increased emphasis on security on the devices themselves.

   However, a survey of IT security decision makers in UK SMEs found that
   while many acknowledge the reality of this situation, policies and
   technologies, particularly with regard to automatic upgrading and
   patching of endpoint security solutions, have yet to catch up.

Many devices, one policy

   Regcast exploring whether a single security policy is possible.

IT security. Are you in control?
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a0a/5613a/4ea/8747e876?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   In the real world the security landscape can be a harsh environment.
   Hackers are using more sophisticated attack methods to penetrate
   networks and steal company data; social networks are being compromised
   and used to distribute malware, and instigate phishing attacks; and the
   proliferation of mobile and cloud applications are opening new
   vulnerabilities ripe for exploitation.

   These vulnerabilities are equally true for small and mid-sized
   businesses (SMBs), but too often SMBs misjudge their level of risk
   exposure as it is often the big corporate security breaches and
   embarrassing data compromises that command media attention.

   For every one of these big security breaches, there are probably dozens
   - if not hundreds - of breaches at companies with less than 500
   employees. Businesses often wrap themselves in a false sense of
   security believing that they are not as interesting or valuable to
   hackers and cybercriminals. That belief is wrong.

   What most businesses fail to realise is that they are dealing with the
   same treacherous security environment as those headline-hitting
   enterprise players and must be mindful to the threats posed by social
   networks, mobile devices, advanced persistent threats (APTs) and
   conventional attack vectors.

Deliver enterprise-class storage whilst lowering cost
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a0f/5613a/4ea/2bab0327?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   High storage costs are often one of the biggest cost drivers in a
   datacenter and Windows Server 2012 helps deliver enterprise-class
   storage availability, flexibility and performance - at a fraction of
   the cost.

   Windows Server 2012 introduces several new storage features and
   capabilities designed to provide enhanced reliability, availability,
   and high performance storage solutions. From improved compatibility
   with the latest storage technologies to forward-thinking innovations
   that make complex storage infrastructures easier to manage, Windows
   Server 2012 has new storage capabilities and features for everyone.

Maximize your productivity, efficiency, and service levels
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a10/5613a/4ea/371e49d3?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   It is essential for IT to provide applications and services that are
   always up and always on. Windows Server 2012 provides high service
   uptime, new capabilities which can endure many failures transparently -
   without interrupting service - and faster recovery when failures do
   occur. These features help improve the availability of individual
   servers, clusters, and even across datacenters.

   To maximize business productivity, efficiency, and service levels, IT
   should make applications, services, and information continuously
   available and resilient to failures. Resource pooling of compute,
   storage, and network resources into virtualized private cloud
   environments can provide resiliency against hardware failures. Windows
   Server provides improved resiliency for your workloads, including
   features which can endure many failures transparently, and help you
   recover quickly when failures do occur.

Planning a Move to the Cloud
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a11/5613a/4ea/70cb2d98?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Cloud Computing is a paradigm shift that sees the dawn of a new age of
   computing driven by distinct benefits. Given the undeniable value to be
   gained from a move to Cloud Computing, it is hardly surprising that
   many organizations are contemplating a shift "to the Clouds".
   Experience has shown however that organizations are concerned around
   the logistics of the move and worried about unintended consequences and
   problems.

   In this paper we describe three broad areas that organizations need to
   think about when moving to the Cloud: technical, internal and external.

   Within these three areas we highlight specific topics that
   organizations should understand prior to a move to the Cloud.
