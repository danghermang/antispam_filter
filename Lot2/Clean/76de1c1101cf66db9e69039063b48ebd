I was asked privately by two folks, so figured it was best to respond to the 
list regarding "why would someone enter an LRSA if it means paying ARIN"...
While not strictly part of the consultation, understanding ARIN's practices
regarding legacy resource holders could be considered germane to the issue,
since the number of legacy resource holders entering into LRSA agreements 
does affect the organizational financials to some extent.

ARIN has provided basic registry services without charge to legacy resource 
holders in the region since inception, as this was an expectation at ARIN's 
formation and has been a position reaffirmed by the ARIN Board of Trustees 
over time.  These registry services include Whois publication, updates to 
the listed points-of-contact on number resources, and reverse DNS service.
While continued provision of these services to legacy resource holders at
no charge is not assured, it also needs to be recognized that the community
benefits from provision of these services in addition to the legacy holders.
Legacy resource holders may opt to contract for these registry services by
entering LRSA with ARIN and paying the end-user fees.  The LRSA provides 
specific contractual rights and obligations (the same ones that are in the 
standard RSA agreement) which some resource holders may find more desirable 
than receiving registry services via the status quo.
