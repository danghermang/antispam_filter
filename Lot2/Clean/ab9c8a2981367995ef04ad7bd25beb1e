Subject:[Koha] Changing the default tab in results page
Dear friends,

When we search for a record in OPAC, koha by default displays the *Holdings* tab. Can I modify things in a way that instead of Holdings *Title notes* tab is displayed by default. I looked in "Global System Preferences" but was unable to find something. Any ideas?

Thank you in advance,
Haik.
