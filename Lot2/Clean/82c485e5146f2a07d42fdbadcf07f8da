Subject:[CT Birds] Eastern CT late afternoon
Jake Musser and I did some poking around shoreline spots out east. Stonington Point was quiet but very windy. Avery Point was quite birdy, with 400 Laughing Gulls, 3 Forster's Terns, 15 Bonaparte's Gulls, and several Northern Gannets. A few distant unidentified scoters too.
