Subject:[h-cost] Embroidery Machines
I can tell you to first not look at price, and more what you want to do
with the machine, some have very small embroidery hoops, which means as a
new person it is difficult to move the fabric so that you get a clean
flowing embroidery.

With that said, I suggest you spend some time looking, at different
machines, go to Sewing Centers and try out the machines, see which ones
'speak' to you.

I don't regret spending the cash for my machine, and I just bought I hope
my last serger, because I listened to others tell me and I should have
bought the Babylock Serger in the beginning, now I am actually USING my
serger, while the others collected dust.

I use my embroidery machine every single day, for all sorts of things I am
making masks with lace programs right now, and they are Stunning.


So my advice? Take the time and do the research!!
