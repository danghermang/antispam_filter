Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Typical FA
The problem with this is that if leaked reports are true then Clattenburg has denied using the word and the assistants all deny hearing him say anything inappropriate. This would mean them then having to come out and say "oh, did you mean if we heard the word monkey in a completely different context to the original complaint, funny you should ask but....." 

That'll be the Ashley Cole evolving statement accusation played out again, only this time it will be called clarification so is ok.
