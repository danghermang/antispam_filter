The same argument was made in the US in the late 1800s after the land
rushes ended and the last bits of unassigned land were taken.  After all,
if there was no more land available, how could the economy survive and grow?

But this isn't the point.  The point is that there is a modest stash of
resources available right now, and that PI requesters are being turned away.

Down the road, everyone will be in the same boat: namely that if IPv4
addresses are needed, they will need to be acquired on the market. We're
not there yet, though.
