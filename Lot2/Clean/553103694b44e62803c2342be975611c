   Hello braun as Welcome to this Tech Resources update from The Register

   Planning a Move to the Cloud
   http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a11/5613a/522/ed16638c?td=3Dm_wpe=
_h

      Cloud Computing is a paradigm shift that sees the dawn of a new age of
      computing driven by distinct benefits. Given the undeniable value to =
be
      gained from a move to Cloud Computing, it is hardly surprising that
      many organizations are contemplating a shift "to the Clouds".
      Experience has shown however that organizations are concerned around
      the logistics of the move and worried about unintended consequences a=
nd
      problems.

      In this paper we describe three broad areas that organizations need to
      think about when moving to the Cloud: technical, internal and externa=
l.

      Within these three areas we highlight specific topics that
      organizations should understand prior to a move to the Cloud.

Running a Business on the Cloud
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a12/5613a/522/fbd1636b?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   The move from traditional IT to Cloud Computing is a massive
   opportunity for an IT department to add value to the organization it
   serves. As with any major technology shift however, this change also
   introduces challenges that need to be proactively managed.

   When management is faced with a shift to Cloud Computing, there are
   three areas that need to be assessed to ensure they are ready for the
   opportunities and challenges that accompany the move, which are
   identified in this paper.

   - Planning for Shifting IT Responsibilities - Developing New Skills -
   Recruitment, Training, Hiring and Retention of Cloud Professionals

   Armed with the information in this paper, management will be
   sufficiently aware of specific areas to look at and should be able to
   greatly lessen the problematic business impacts of a move to the Cloud.

In search of a better way to enable telework
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a49/5613a/522/e89ad57c?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Remote work is becoming increasingly important for organizations that
   are attempting to drive down their costs and to become more agile by
   enabling employees to work from any location - at home, at customers'
   sites, in remote offices, etc. Moreover, the US and other governments
   have become significant proponents of the telework concept as a means
   of reducing their costs and to support various "green" initiatives.

Building the silver lining
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a4d/5613a/522/4b2b7992?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   IT managers and directors can find it challenging enough to keep
   abreast of the latest Cloud developments, let alone ensure that that
   the systems they are deploying are robust enough to support the daily
   growing demands organisations are placing on their IT departments. Even
   more challenging is to roll out systems and approaches that meet not
   just today's demands, but those of the future as well.

   In this report we turn to look at the major benefits businesses have
   seen from moving to the Cloud and the barriers that prevent them from
   doing more. Finally, we also examine how the UK's underlying IT
   infrastructure is coping with the demands of the mature Cloud.

Apache Hadoop Big Data Refinery
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a54/5613a/522/283fc282?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   This white paper outlines a strategy for a big data refinery and how it
   might apply in your organization.

   It is targeted at technical executives and practitioners new to big
   data. This white paper expands upon the data refinery analogy to
   explore the key characteristics and capabilities of Apache Hadoop and
   how they apply to business analytics.

   Topics Covered:
     * Data processing using Apache Hadoop
     * Components of a big data refinery
     * HCatalog as a metadata service
     * How to get started with Apache Hadoop

CLOUD VS IN-HOUSE
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a5d/5613a/522/6b4f5ace?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   How companies host their IT infrastructure underpins their web,
   ebusiness and internal operations. This decision is based on many
   factors. Cost is clearly an important consideration, but other factors
   such as risk management, service quality and reliability are also
   critical.

   Hosting decisions however should not just be based on technical
   requirements but should also be influenced by an organisation's
   strategy and growth plans. Outsourcing IT Infrastructure can transform
   the way that you and your colleagues are supported.

   If you are currently deciding whether to utilise in-house or outsourced
   hosting this report will help you appreciate both sides of the
   argument.
