Hi Ian, 

We use the DM-550s here for remote frog monitoring. 

I've found they work best with a small external microphone (~$50e) rather than the unit's microphone itself. I'd also recommend a very good set of rechargeable batteries (Eneloop or similar) as the units can really chew the juice depending on the recording quality and recording length involved. 

The only problem we've ran into when using them as a remote monitoring unit is that the date/time sometimes needs resetting after a battery change (esp when they go flat). They have some great options onboard and are otherwise great little gadgets.

Cheers Tim

Subject: [Birding-Aus] RFI: Comparison of Olympus digital recorders

Hello all

<>
Last week I decided to buy a hearing aid and immediately found the 
difference for discerning bird calls remarkable. At the local 
supermarket on Saturday morning I was hearing a Little Wattlebird and a 
Greenfinch calling simultaneously and the sound was so loud and clear 
compared to anything heard for decades, it has encouraged a new found 
interest in sound.

Having already in my possession an Olympus DM-550 digital sound recorder 
and now, with all this new found enthusiasm, I am hoping that someone 
with knowledge could give me an indication about the usefulness of my 
existing unit as I have no knowledge or experience to compare its 
suitability for recording bird song.

Included is a comparison link to other recommended Olympus birdsong 
recorders but I don't know what features are relevant,
