Subject:[bcp] Today's Schwenksville Ride - now 10:00 start
Quick notice, per radar, there's a band of rain heading our way. Looks like=
 a good chance of rain at start time, but it is likely to pass soon thereaf=
ter. We'll now plan on a 10:00 start, and wait in the lot for a short while=
 to start should it be raining at that time. We can also cut it short if th=
ere is more rain on the way later into the ride. =



I'm determined to get a ride in if we can. =
