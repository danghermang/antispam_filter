Hmm, I'm not sure if we missed the point here. Voting in the sense of 'to 
make a decision' is not part of the Descussion System we are talking about. 
It's part of the Decision System.

It's more about Rating (as I tried to clarify on the other thread) and 
forming one's opinion.

Yes. If we can agree on 'VOTING' to be read as 'RATING'.

The working group has consensus about the trisection of the tool based 
process of decision-making into Information, Discussion and Decision System.

Therefore I think the working group member all agree on 'VOTING' to be 
located in the Decision System and 'RATING' to be located in the 'Discussion 
System'. This is because we want to distinguish between the more formal 
process of decision, that needs to be conform with legal law, and the 
process of discussion that is free of all juridical rules.


Even if it is very hard for me to find the right words in english, I 
appreciate our discussion!

Hope you are lenient toward me ;o)

Cheers
