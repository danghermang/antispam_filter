Plain Flat Pewter Buttons  Hello,I am in search of a source for large quantities of plain flat pewter buttons, both large (7/8 - 1 inch) & small (9/16-1/2 inch) for Revolutionary War coats. I checked James Townsend & the cost for the amount of buttons for just one coat is quite high. Does anyone know where I can get larger amounts for a lower cost? I would really appreciate it.Sarah Grace

In the Files section there is a file that explains how to remove the U3 software (not on all devices) from the USB device in order to get it to work in Viking machines.  There is also a listing of the USB devices that are compatible.  Since the Designer 1 is an older machine, it also cannot handle a lot of the high capacity USB devices currently available.  You should also consider joining the Designer1 Yahoo group.  The knowledge available in the user groups is phenomenal!

> Not many pre-existing ones, but if you find a good digitiser, you can commission quite a few. Most charge by the stitch which can make it expensive for satin stitch and totally filled designs, but for blackwork and such, they can be relatively small and therefore reasonably priced. It all depends on how much you are really going to do. Claricia
