Subject:Re: [Chelsea] What did the ref say?
[HS: More details. Obviously making more of the Mikel thing - he got
booked on the pitch in an argument with the ref - because if the
"Spanish twat" commented referred to Torres, no-one could reasonably
criticise him for that. Also Torres was lucky to get away with just a
yellow for his chest-high studs-up lunge at Cleverley at the end of
the first half]

Ref race row! Chelsea accuse Clattenburg of abusing Mikel and
referring to a 'Spanish t***' during fiery United win at the Bridge
[Mail]

By Neil Ashton

Mark Clattenburg was caught up in a storm on Sunday night after the
referee was accused of aiming a racist insult at Chelsea midfielder
John Obi Mikel during their 3-2 home defeat by Manchester United at
Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea made a complaint to the Premier League after Mikel stormed
into the referee=92s room to demand an apology after claiming
Clattenburg made a racist slur when he booked the midfielder in the
76th minute.

One of Chelsea=92s Spanish stars is also involved after players claim
they heard Clattenburg refer to him as =91a Spanish t**t=92.

Chelsea made the official complaint at 7.45pm on Sunday night, but
Clattenburg had already been confronted by then. Chief executive Ron
Gourlay, with Mikel and manager Roberto Di Matteo, demanded an apology
during stormy scenes in the referee=92s room.

Clattenburg refused and Chelsea decided to take the incredible action
of launching an immediate complaint to the Premier League over his
language.

According to sources close to the players, they are willing to make
statements to the FA=92s disciplinary committee this week.

A club spokesman said: =91We have lodged a complaint to the Premier
League match delegate with regards to inappropriate language used by
the referee and directed at two of our players in two separate
incidents in today=92s match. The match delegate will pass the complaint
to the FA.=92

The matter is now in the hands of the FA and Premier League officials,
who will ask Sky TV for footage from the 20 camera angles used for
live matches. While not all are recorded, they should help confirm
whether Clattenburg made an inappropriate or racially aggravated
comment.

Premier League referees also wear microphones, which suggests evidence
by Michael McDonough and Simon Long=97 who ran the line =97 or fourth
official Michael Jones could be crucial.

The incidents occurred on the day Chelsea threw support behind the
Kick Racism Out of Football campaign. Players from Chelsea and United
=97 with the exception of United=92s Ashley Young =97 wore One Game One
Community T-shirts in the warm-up. John Terry, serving a four-match
ban for racially insulting Anton Ferdinand last October, wore a Kick
It Out badge as he watched from the sidelines.

Rio Ferdinand, fined =A345,000 for his =91choc ice=92 tweet, also ended his
feud with Ashley Cole when they shook hands before the game.

But all that was forgotten amid dramatic scenes nearly two hours after
the final whistle.

Home players heard the alleged comment to Mikel and will back up his
story. Clattenburg said he would  co-operate with any inquiry.

Professional Game Match Officials, the body which represents Premier
League referees, released a statement which read: =91PGMO is aware of
the allegations and they are being treated with the utmost
seriousness. Mark will co-operate fully and welcomes the opportunity
for the facts to be established.=92
