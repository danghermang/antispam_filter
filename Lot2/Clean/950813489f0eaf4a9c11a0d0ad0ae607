   Hello braun as Welcome to this Tech Resources update from The Register

   Backup and Recovery of Large-scale VMware Environments
   http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/99e/5613a/4f1/2e99d74a?td=3Dm_wpe=
_h

      Organizations begin with IT-based applications residing in the data
      center and, after discovering the benefits and becoming more
      comfortable with the technology, they begin to expand virtualization
      deployments. As they start virtualizing user-facing applications, new
      challenges arise.

      For those applications, consolidation is not the focus; high
      availability and data protection are. As a result, any task that limi=
ts
      productivity or scalability, such as I/O-intensive backup, must be
      examined carefully.

      Traditional backup processes aren't always the best solution in virtu=
al
      deployments. They weren't built for the extreme data redundancy and
      hefty server loads of consolidated environments.

Unified Storage Consolidation for Microsoft Windows Installations

   Unified storage is infrastructure that supports multiple types of
   storage within a single management framework. In an ideal scenario, an
   admin can access a single set of tools and functions that are
   transparent to the type of storage used.

   The specific business case analysis detailed in this paper compares a
   base case of a varied number of storage solutions with a unified
   storage solution for a Wikibon Reference Organization with revenues of
   $250 million, 1,000 staff, and an IT budget of $7.5 million.

Many devices, one policy

Planning a Move to the Cloud
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a11/5613a/4f1/e3ecd96f?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Cloud Computing is a paradigm shift that sees the dawn of a new age of
   computing driven by distinct benefits. Given the undeniable value to be
   gained from a move to Cloud Computing, it is hardly surprising that
   many organizations are contemplating a shift "to the Clouds".
   Experience has shown however that organizations are concerned around
   the logistics of the move and worried about unintended consequences and
   problems.

   In this paper we describe three broad areas that organizations need to
   think about when moving to the Cloud: technical, internal and external.

   Within these three areas we highlight specific topics that
   organizations should understand prior to a move to the Cloud.

Running a Business on the Cloud
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a12/5613a/4f1/602caf2b?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   The move from traditional IT to Cloud Computing is a massive
   opportunity for an IT department to add value to the organization it
   serves. As with any major technology shift however, this change also
   introduces challenges that need to be proactively managed.

   When management is faced with a shift to Cloud Computing, there are
   three areas that need to be assessed to ensure they are ready for the
   opportunities and challenges that accompany the move, which are
   identified in this paper.

   - Planning for Shifting IT Responsibilities - Developing New Skills -
   Recruitment, Training, Hiring and Retention of Cloud Professionals

   Armed with the information in this paper, management will be
   sufficiently aware of specific areas to look at and should be able to
   greatly lessen the problematic business impacts of a move to the Cloud.

Securing the Mobile App Market
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/a1b/5613a/4f1/9a2ac7b8?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   The emergence of mobile applications has fundamentally changed the way
   that millions of people around the world work, play, and communicate.
   Users can now download every type of application imaginable - from
   games, to maps, to movie and TV show tie - ins, to apps that will turn
   a device into a flashlight, and more-directly to their smart phones and
   other mobile devices.

   Though the market for mobile apps is still relatively young, it has
   grown exponentially over the past several years and will continue to
   expand rapidly. Fueled by millions of consumers and business users
   looking for innovative applications, this explosive growth presents a
   tremendous opportunity for software developers looking to create - and
   monetise - the next hit app to help people be more productive, or
   simply have fun.

   But developers aren't the only ones looking to profit from the surge in
   apps - cybercriminals want to infect and exploit as many mobile devices
   as they can to steal confidential information. Infected apps are not
   only a threat to mobile device users, but also to network and platform
   providers, device manufacturers,and the reputation of the industry as a
   whole.

   Fortunately, developers can protect their code - and their customers -
   with a straightforward and easy-to-manage technology: code signing
   certificates. This white paper will detail the rise of mobile
   applications and why code signing certificates are essential to
   protecting the entire mobile apps ecosystem.
