Subject:[CT Birds]  Northern shrike!!!
CT Birders,

Late afternoon I glanced out at the feeders that have been 
hosting 100 plus Pine siskins and I had to do a double take at what I first thought was a mockingbird when in fact it was a Northern shrike!!!!
This is a life bird for me and a first for the sanctuary that I have observed!
Interestingly the mockingbird was perched nearby watching but for sure al the siskins were long gone.
