You seem relieved when the machine got through the record..I don't blame yo=
u.

Very much to your credit is getting good speed consistency, along with ever=
ything else, all the samples I've heard have an annoying flutter problem.

I used to laugh at the childish "me too" attitude evinced in going to 104 -=
two extra records.

Pokey old Rock-Ola did it right and came out with a 60 record machine with =
reliable mech.....Too bad they used cheap motors.

Wurlitzer did vindicate themselves with the carousel mech.=A0 With minor mo=
dification that mech could have been adapted to microprocessor control, ins=
tead they took giant leap backward with that plastic-y flatbed mech.

Great looking and good sounding machine Ed, congrats.

Victor -

Here is my W1500A on You Tube -- you can see the original colors of the
grill bars and the W on the front. Good luck!
