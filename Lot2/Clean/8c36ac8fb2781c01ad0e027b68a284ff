Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] RMS power
A final note on this topic.
In German language RMS voltage/current is called Effektiv-Spannung/-Strom
and average power is always called Effektiv-Leistung.
Therefore we are always referring just to the equivalent heating of a
resistor with DC
without saying how RMS voltage/current and/or average power are calcuated.
Thus in German language the confusion about 'RMS'- and average power has
never been possible.
