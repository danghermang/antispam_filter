Subject:[CT Birds] Enjoying the Zip in E Hartford
I don't know about the rest of you, but that familiar zippy call of the
Pine Siskins is one of the big benefits to having them in the back yard, as
far as I am concerned.  Right now they are clogging my newly filled nyger
feeder (I can count at least 20) and zipping away between mouthfulls.  I
can tell this will be an expensive winter.
