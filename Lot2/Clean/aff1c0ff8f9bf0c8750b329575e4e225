As this is a very interesting subject, wouldn't it be nice to just install a application that would generate a complex password for you, then you manually enter it once on the site, then after that, the application will login for you. I know that these applications exist.

Oh, yes...and for those who happen to be the owner of the offending account?   Change the password
to something a little more complicated.   Your callsign is not sufficient as they also build a
dictionary from the content of emails in the cracked account they are gleaning your email address
from.

Put some non-alphabetical characters in there.

For example.

981@D0ntH@ckMe$

Once the password cracking engine exhausts the dictionary - it will drop you off the crack list -
until it gets your email address supplied from another cracked account of course.

These are not Virus generated.  These are compromised accounts.    They use brute force dictionary
attacks direct on the SMTP connector of Yahoo, Hotmail etc to crack the password - as this method
does not lead to a locked out account.   If you use a simple password, then it is only a matter of
time before your account becomes one of the spam senders.   

The days of virus spam bots on machines are dying out, there is no need to do that anymore as
people are lax with their passwords and make them easy to crack.   Once they gain access to your
account, then they will spam everyone in your address book.   This includes reflectors (easy now as
you have an authenticated account).   And replying to one of these simply gets you on the crack
list and spam list.   Best just to block the offending account from the reflector and you own
email.

You can simply check the X-Originating IP of these emails to find they originated from a machine in
a foreign land - this one for example came from a machine in Germany (a university).

I own two fairly large Yahoo reflectors, DXLab and SteppIR, and have 
been receiving dozens of those scam messages both via the reflectors and 
privately. Fortunately, most of the people sending the scam are 
moderated on my reflectors so very few of them are getting through to 
the lists but it is wide spread and attacking a lot of hams. Most of it 
seems to be from people using Msn, Gmail and Yahoo mail.
