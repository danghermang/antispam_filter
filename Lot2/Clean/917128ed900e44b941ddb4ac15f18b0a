Subject:[meteorite-list] Novato
Does anyone know the location in Novato where the 2nd specimen was
found? I'm close to the area, and wanted to hunt today..Novato is
spread quite large, so, pinning down a spot would help..I did hunt
some shoreline of a nearby lake, with no luck, but, I had left my
batteries in my metal detector, and, they were dead, with no spares in
truck...learned my lesson about taking the 9-volts out afer use!
Good Luck Hunting!
