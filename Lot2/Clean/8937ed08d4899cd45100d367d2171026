Subject:Re: [child_lit] An African-American friend asks who read what?
On a tangent from Miriam's post... My son's grade 10 class is reading
Sherman Alexie's _The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian_ right
now... But maybe, being in Vancouver, with a larger native population than
many school districts in BC, there is a pointed rationale for such an
excellent choice. Regardless, I am pleased that it is required reading. My
son and his friends loved it.
