Subject:[h-cost] "Medieval brides wore red."

I just read the comment that "medieval brides wore red" in a book that does not attribute any source for the statement but has a bibliography and index.  The book makes me itchy because it is such a hybrid of fact and fiction.  

Anyway, my question is this: is that statement based on fact?  If so, what are the sources for this?  Was it true for all cultures?  Only Italy or ... ?  

It's an intriguing thing to say, and I would love, please, to learn more about bride colors in the Middle Ages, or, rather, specifically for me the late eleventh and twelfth centuries in southern Italy, if there is such specific information.

Thanks, all.
