Do you really believe they're that accurate?

I can connect an analogue LM35 sensor up to an Arduino - this has a 0-100C 
range over 0-5V and then I can get: 100 / 1024 = 0.098C resolution.

Does this mean it's really that accurate? No way. But I can display those 
numbers and it looks "good". Same as the kitchen ones are doing. It looks 
good, but it's no-where near accurate.

Standard temperature and pressure... Good job finding that economically...
