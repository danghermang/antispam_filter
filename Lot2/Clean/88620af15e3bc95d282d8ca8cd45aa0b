Subject:[Jukebox-list] M100A Mech restoration
Thanks John,

One of my two M100A mechs has been 'converted' to 45rpm, sadly. It looks to be 
the CalCoin solution to the dreaded 78rpm problem ;-)
I have the (paper) conversion manual and a box of additional parts. I do not 
think I have the 78rpm parts to go back to normalcy. 

It's a really clean mech and, according to the chap I bought the box from, was 
sorta working but there were kinks that needed to be ironed out.
I have decided to keep it on 45rpm but get it working properly. In the mean 
time, I'm keeping an eye out for a working or restore-able mech still on 78rpm.

My other mech is on 78rpm (never converted) but needs to be gone through to get 
it running properly.

That's the situation I'm in.  Looking forward to digging in to them but could 
sure use some helpful guidance from those who have walked this path before.

 Hi Bob,  A number of these machines were converted to play 45s. I have PDFs of  
two companies conversion processes that you can use to back out of the  
conversion (maybe)... https://www.flippers.com/Seeburg-trblshoot.html John :-#)#
