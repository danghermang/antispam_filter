Subject:[Koha] All items say new.
Hello, just a question. We changed over to Koha in May of 2011. For the mos=
t part everything is going fine.
The bothersome part is everything is listed as "new". Example:

New-FIC
New-ANF
New-BIO
New-MAG
Is there anything I can do about this? Do I have to submit a bug? It isn't =
catastrophic, but very bothersome. =


The other thing is how can I add a collection code. We do not have a code f=
or a few items, such as Juv Bio and DVDs. I have checked the manual and can=
't find out how to do this. Tried going into authorities, feeling this woul=
d be my best shot..Can't find it. Any help greatly appreciated. Have a wond=
erful week.
