Levente,

Bo Thide did not invent the notion of quantized orbital angular momentum, 
and the infinite range of possibilities thereof.

This was done in 1913 by Niels Bohr.

Your are correct that this notion is worthy of a Nobel prize -- which was 
awarded to Bohr in 1922.

-------------
Thide is a latecomer to this game, who makes dramatic claims that well-known 
physics could revolutionize the communications industry.

But, as you note, it is technically awkward to use the high orbital angular 
momentum states of light.

People are working hard on this, and no doubt some measure of success will 
be achieved in implementing this 100-year-old idea.

My personal take is that a "revolution" is unlikely.

It is generally much easier just to increase the frequency of the lowest 
angular-momentum mode used in, say, fiberoptics, to increase the number of 
bits/sec that can be transmitted.   Next, it's easy to bundle multiple 
fibers into a cable to increase further the bit-transmission rate per cable.

Nonetheless, we technogeeks are optimistic that some niche can be found for 
the use of higher orbital angular momentum modes.   So far, we are still 
waiting....

  Hallo.

  This is an update, and a pickup on a debate in Antennex on the
matter, that stalled in a draw, as I recall, a year ago.

  About a year ago there was a proposition and crude demonstration
by Bo Thide of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Venice Italy,
claiming that selecting different orbital momentums for photons, an
infinity of communication channels can be opened up on the same
single frequency channel.
  That would be earthshaking, worthy of a quick Nobel Prize, if true.

  A year ago I took a close look at the Venice experimental setup,
and was underwhelmed. It was a reflector antenna, reflector slit
and twisted into a corkscrew, the split separated axially by one
wavelength(?).
  To me - at least - that was a geometric arrangement, that distorted
the aiming point of the antenna into a cone, where every part of the
cone carried the same info + a fixed phase shift of the carrier.
No orbital momentum visible to this engineer.
  Prof Bo Thide had a different assessment, obviously.

  Now the matter is revived, and still contested:

There are plenty of links for details, arguments, conterarguments.

I like the Laszlo B. Kish / Robert D Nevels paper

http://vixra.org/pdf/1209.0107v7.pdf

for its brevity, arguing, that many orbital modes in free space
would violate fundamental rules of particle physics and the
Second Law of Thermodynamics.

  It would be nice, if somebody commenting, would remember
the name of the old thread from a year ago.

best regards
Levente
