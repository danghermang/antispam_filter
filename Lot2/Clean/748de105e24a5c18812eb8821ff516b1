Keep an eye out for the weather.  It looks wet for Saturday, and 
possibly windy after that.

> For those planning to attend the Hopewell Classic ride through the Oley Valley on Saturday: The start location can be found on the French Creek State Park website. On the park map, look for the boat launch area by the lake. Plenty of parking there. - Post ride you will be able to change out of your cycling gear in the nearby bathrooms. Showers are NOT available, but the bathrooms are large enough, and private enough for a change of clothing. - I would like to start as close to 9:00 as possible (we are meeting other riders en-route), so try to get to the start asap. Driving time from center city Phila is ~1 hour 15 mins. -  If you are running late, I will leave extra cue sheets on my vehicle ( a red Toyota Tacoma extended cab pickup truck). We will rendezvous with the tardies at the first rest stop in the chocolatier. - Hope to see you Saturday, Rich
