5-7 years from now sounds like right about the time that the fee
schedule will be up for revisiting anyway...

Since we like the idea of subnetting and delegating on nybble
boundaries in IPv6 anyway, why not just deprecate small and medium as
categories and say "/32 ix X-small, /31 to /28 is Large, /27 to /23 is
X-Large, and /22 and larger is XXL.  That's pretty close to our
existing fee schedule which has served us well.  Or use the dividing
lines suggested in the proposed 2013 rate card...  so long as merely
having the smallest ISP allocation of IPv6 in and of itself does not
turn one into small rather than x-small I'm good with it.
