Hi Michael,

I like the way you break things down!

Ok. A Group could be seen as an aggregate of Participants. For me an 
*aggregate* is a HAS relation while a *composite* is a CONSISTS OF relation. 
So with an composite one could argue that the Participant is dispersed in 
the Group.

YES! And this mapping should grow. I saw already some more similarities 
between eDialogos and CBEM. Unfortunately I don't know 'Outcast', but maybe 
that's Votorolas data schema?

Maybe we can try to reach the following target: Reaching consensus about a 
'Common eDecision-Making Standard'

This may consist of

1) A Common Domain Model (NOT a database schema); this are entities to be 
common to all tools / systems

2) A Common  Use Case Model; this are processes / workflows / actions to be 
common to all tools / systems
This could look like the following - just a first draft and unfortunately in 
german language again:

So let's see how far can we push this approach!

What do you think?

Cheers
