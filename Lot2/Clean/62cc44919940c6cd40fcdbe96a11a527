Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Manu
I'm a lurker.
I rarely comment on the list.
but...........

This is shit!!!!!

Ivanovic never made a challenge. Free kick OK - red card - f**k off!!!!

Torres was clipped - if he gets a 2nd yellow/red then Young should get a 
yellow for the same reason.

The little pea!!!!!! -  offside.

I tell you what - when you get shit from manu fans at work this week - 
if any other referee had been involved - a different result would have 
occurred.
If they take pride in this win - the ref was embarrassing.

manu could not deal with us today.
we could have won 4-2 if we were not playing 9 vs 12

On the bright side. - Barcelona - winning the ball back high up the 
pitch - sound familiar???

If we play like that for the rest of the season - we'll win the title in 
march.

Why do people rave about Rooney??  - f****d if I know!

rant over.

back to lurking....
