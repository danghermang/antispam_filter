Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Is the valve amp in these mono ? Rowe Ami Cadette
I've seen less than ten of those here in NYC, none were tube and mono.

However if you look at where the seller is, that may explain it.=A0 In the =
late 1960's the USA continued to enjoy a very favorable currency exchange r=
ate with Europe.=A0 The effects of our goddamn war in Vietnam and resulting=
 debt hadn't ruined that balance...Yet.

So assuming that was built here in America it makes sense that various econ=
omies were offered on the export machines to make them at least somewhat co=
mpetitive with foreign built.

I don't understand what that wire is doing sticking into the place where a =
second input plug would normally be.

Converting that to stereo would be pretty straightforward.

I've worked on quite a few of these many years ago, but never seen one with
a mono valve amp in, only the transistorised option. Looking at the picture
in the ad below, the valve amp seems mono.

Is that correct ?

In fact, as I type, I think some of the ones with stereo amps in only had
one input plug connected.=20
