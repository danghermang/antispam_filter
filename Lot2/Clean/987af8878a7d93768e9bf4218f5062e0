Subject:Re: [h-cost] Embroiderry software
I have a housemate who does machine embroidery and I posed this
question to her::

Her reply is:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Creating an embroidery design is not quite like creating a graphic
design. There are issues of stitch size, thread pathing, push-pull
compensation, just to name a few.   There can be a fairly steep
learning curve with any embroidery software.

Having said that, one of the most common packages is called Embird.
There is a basic module and several add-on with different functions,
which can drive up the cost. Thred (sic) is free but not well
supported. Embroider Magic 2 is comparatively low cost, and there are
several yahoo groups supporting it.

In thinking of which machine to buy you want to look at the sewing
field size, what embroidery formats the machine uses, and how the
designs get onto the machine. Methods for that include USB drives,
proprietary cards, and connection directly to a PC.

If you have any more questions please contact me and I'll forward your
message to her.
