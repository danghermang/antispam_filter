Subject:[Jukebox-list] 2810 issues-Lift Arms

We think the problems lie with the motor cap located in the junction unit. =
I am reluctant, however, to restart the power supply with the lift arm in t=
he up position. Can I hold the lift arms down and the rotate the motor to g=
et the cam facing forward (which should lower the arm), or will this cause =
more problems? Also as described in earlier email, there is a micro switch =
located at center back of unit just below the turntable deck. It has 6 wire=
s connected to its six terminals. When I depress the sritch button, the tur=
ntable starts. When released, the turntable motor stops. Other than that, t=
he unit does nothing except light up. All the fuses and relays appear corre=
ct and test as good. We didn't actually test the red relays, but switched s=
ome from a working 2910 unit
