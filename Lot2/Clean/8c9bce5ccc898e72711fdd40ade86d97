Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] RMS power, II
Bruce,

As pointed out by Dave, the misnomer is calling "average power" by the term =

"RMS power".

As I pointed out several emails ago, if the wave amplitude varies as A0 sin =

wt, then the wave power varies as A0^2 sin^2 wt

The average power is K A0^2 / 2,
where constant K depends on the wave speed, and the relation between =

amplitude and energy.
The mathematical RMS power is K A0^2 sqrt(3/8) =3D 0.61 K A0^2.

But when people speak of RMS power in cases like this, they (usually) mean
K A0^2 / 2 =3D average power,
and NOT
K A0^2 sqrt(3/8) =3D mathematical RMS power.

-------------
How did this widespread confusion arise?

My speculation is that this is because we do (correctly) speak of the RMS =

AMPLITUDE as
A0 / sqrt(2).

Then it is "natural" (but not technically correct) to speak of the square o=
f =

the RMS amplitude, namely
K A0^2 / 2,
as the "RMS power".

As Clemens notes, AVERAGE power is the product of the relevant RMS =

amplitudes, while mathematical RMS power is not equal to the product of =

these amplitudes.

Rob Thorpe has given an interesting discussion of how HP spectrum-analyzer =

labels also contributed to the confusion.

--------------------
It appears to me that Dave is the only one bothered by this extremely commo=
n =

misnomer.   I'm sure I will revert to my old bad habits on this one in a fe=
w =

days.

I don't see why you can't speak of the rms average of power, or almost any =

other quantity. As long as you can square it, evaluate the mean value of =

that square, and take the square root of the result, you've got a =

root-mean-square average value. True, you run the risk of being =

Subject: [Antenna-discussion] RMS power, II

Ed,

It would be interesting to see a quote from the FCC that uses the term "RMS
power", since this is a technical misnomer, as pointed out by Dave.

I found some FCC stuff on the web:

Slide 21 of
http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/ea/presentations/files/oct11/5cEMC-Power-Meas=
urements-Review-102611-SKJ.pdf
uses the term "average/RMS power", probably to indicate that what many
people call "RMS power" is really "average power".

Item 4b(vi) on p. 3 of
https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/comments/GetPublishedDocument.html?id=3D226&tn=3D4=
05605
says "Detector =3D RMS (i.e. averaging)".
This seems to be pointing out that a knob/button on a power meter is
mislabeled.
ditto for item 4b(viii)

I think the message is that lots of us are sloppy about using the term "RMS
power" when we mean "average power".   The FCC seems to be aware of this.

--------------------------
Example, in a series R_L_C circuit driven sinusoidally, the average power
delivered to each of the capacitor and inductor is zero, but that delivered
to the resistor is not.

However, energy does flow onto, and back off of each of the capacitor and
inductor.

So, it is valid to speak of the nonzero, RMS power associate with the
capacitor and inductor.

But, does anyone ever do this?

V =3D V0 cos wt =3D Re v0 exp(j w t)
Z =3D R + j X
X =3D w L - 1 / w C =3D (w^2 L C - 1) / w C
A =3D 1 / z =3D 1 / (R + j X) =3D (R - j X) / (R^2 + X^2)
I =3D V / Z =3D V A
We need
Re I =3D [V0 / (R^2 + X^2)] Re[(R - j X) exp(j wt)]
      =3D  [V0 / (R^2 + x^2)] [R cos wt + X sin wt]
To discuss the power in the inductor, we need
V_L =3D j w L I
We need the real part of this
Re[V_L] =3D w L Re[j I] =3D - w L Im I
             =3D - w  L [V0 / (R^2 + X^2)] Im[(R - j X) exp(j wt)]
             =3D - w  L [V0 / (R^2 + X^2)] [R sin w t - X cos wt]

The power in the inductor is
P_L =3D Re[V_L] [Re I
      =3D - [w L V0^2 / (R^2 + L^2)^2] [R X (sin^2 wt - cos^2 wt) + (R^2 -
X^2) cos wt sin wt]
      =3D [w L V0^2 / (R^2 + L^2)^2] [R X cos 2wt + (1/2)(R^2 - X^2) sin 2w=
t]

The AVERAGE of P_L is zero, since both terms are sinusoidal.

However the RMS power is nonzero
P_L,RMS =3D [w L V0^2 / (R^2 + x^2)^2] sqrt[ R^2 X^2 / 2 + (R^2 - X^2)^2 / =
8]
               =3D [w L V0^2 / (R^2 + x^2)^2] [(R^2 + X^2) / 2 sqrt(2)]
               =3D w L V0^2 / [2 sqrt(2) (R^2 + X^2)]

for what it's worth.

At resonance, where X =3D 0 (and w L =3D 1 / w C), this becomes
P_L,RMS,resonance =3D w L V0^2 / [2 sqrt(2) R^2]

Similarly, the RMS power into the capacitor at resonance is
P_C,RMS,resonance =3D V0^2 / [2 sqrt(2) w R C]
                                 =3D P_L,RMS,resonance

At resonance, energy flows back and forth between the C and the L.
The average power of this flow is zero, but the RMS power is nonzero.

paradox


Back in the 1970's the FCC in the USA published rules about how audio
amplifier manufacturers could make claims about the power output of
their products.
And the requirement was that RMS power per channel with all channels
fully driven with a sinusoidal wave form was the only claim allowed.
Anything that follows a sinusoidal wave form has an r.m.s. measurement.
