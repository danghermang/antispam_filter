Subject:Re: [burners] EL Wire
I've bought EL wire from auto parts stores as a part of a kit for pimping y=
our ride.

also just got some from Woot as a part of a dress-up kit for bikes.=A0 Not =
sure whether a bike shop would stock them, looked like it would be more pac=
kaged for mass market consumer outlets.

Good luck.

Anyone know where I can pick up EL wire or EL wire kits for Arduino?

I want to play with building some stuff tonight and can't be bothered to
order online and wait!

Thanks in advance,
