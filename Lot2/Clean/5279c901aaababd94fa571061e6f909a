Subject:[Flexradio] Computer recommendations
I'm in a quandary. I've been having trouble for some time now running my
flex5KA under windows on my iMac (under Boot Czmp). I've been unable over
the course of several weeks to fix the BSOD problem which came about
shortly after the upgrade to 2.4.4 So I have several choices and would like
your input.

1. Buy a new windows only computer - which off the shelf model are you
using successfully? I'm also considering one of Neal's.

2. Pay for tech support to try and remotely fix my problem and stick with
my iMac.

3. Get out of the SDR business all together and sell my flex as I've become
a bit jaded with radios that are computer dependent. On the other hand it's
established an expectation that will be hard to match.

What would you do? I'd be grateful for suggestions and computer
recommendations.
Tnx
Rick
