Subject:[bcp] Calling all Garmin 800 (or any other model) Users for Help
Riding home today, my Garmin was displaying obviously wrong info.  Speed and distance were malfunctioning.  I surmise it must have been a problem with the GPS connection -- perhaps the satellites were having a bad day.  From time to time, I have had the same issue with the automatic pause, when it tells me I am not moving, when of course I am.

I thought that when there was a problem with GPS the speed/distance sensor on my crank/wheel would correct for the problem.  Am I wrong?

When this problem occurs, is there any way to manually turn off the GPS and rely on the crank/wheel sensor for speed and distance?  I know that if you are out of satellite coverage it will ask if you want to discontinue searching and you can reply on the sensors.  However, how to do you do this when satellites are available, but just not working very well?

I have tried to find the answers in the Garmin manual, but so far have been unsuccessful.

Any assistance would be most appreciated.

Jim
