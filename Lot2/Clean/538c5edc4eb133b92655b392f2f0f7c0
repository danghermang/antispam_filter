Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Imax on DXing
As you probably know, 35 - 40 MHz still has some 
allocations in the US to public safety and land 
mobile users, and you have no legal right to 
transmit in that range.

I hope you have more regard for the amateur radio 
regulations than you have for licensed users now.
