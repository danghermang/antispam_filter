Kathleen Odean's _Great Books for Girls_, while ten years old, might give you some good leads.

I'm looking for some recommendations of recent (say, last 10 years) GOOD
books for younger readers - post picture-book up to the middle-grade genre
- that have interesting or appealing female protagonists OR are just
generally really good books that don't go crazy with the gendering of their
readers. I don't want super-girly books (no Fancy Nancy!) but I also don't
want the overtly preachy Girl Power! books either. I'm not very strong in
this age range, especially not in more recent texts, so suggestions are
very welcome.
If you have a favorite blog or site for discovering books in this age range
(or picture books), I'd also love to get those.

Most important criterion is QUALITY - in broad terms, what we mean when we
say a book is "literary" or "well-written."

Thank you thank you!

~Kerry
