Basically using ISPs for evidence gathering of crimes that haven't 
happened yet, and may never.  While I agree traffic analysis is a 
valuable tool - as used by MI5 in the early days of electronic snooping 
on foreign activity in the UK - why gather an entire estate full of 
gorse bushes when all you really need is one twig?  Also isn't it more 
likely that real criminals will use encrypted traffic, VPNs etc to 
disguise the source and destination as well as the content?  Surely the 
example of OBL who had no computers at all in his compound and used 
human couriers is a reason to doubt the efficacy of this tactic?  That 
and the fact that an increasingly common tactic is to use the Drafts 
function of a webmail account, thus ensuring no direct contact between 
conspirators anyway.
