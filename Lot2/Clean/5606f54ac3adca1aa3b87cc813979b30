I found some matched pairs of 6973eh online, but I read they had some quali=
ty issues and the tubes just didn't work.=A0=20
=A0 If I go with the 6973 s should I replace those resistors that are off.=
=A0 Both the schematic and banding tell me 470k but they measure way off.=
=A0 Maybe that is why the existing 6973 tests at 50%.=A0 It was cooked.=A0 =
I'm also going to replace the 1 watt bias resistor and diode.=A0 What diode=
 would you use a 1n4004?
Thanks
