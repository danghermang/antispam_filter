Subject:[Chelsea] Ratings v Swansea
Swansea (Hernandez, 88) Chelsea 1 (Moses, 61)
We looked like we were playing in treacle rather than the hailstones that rained down in the last quarter. There was no zip to our play. Let's put it down to the absence of Mata and the 120 minutes in midweek. Even the introduction of Ramires at half time didn't speed things up. 
Swansea plays some neat football but never looked like pulling the trigger until the late equalizer after we decided to shut up shop and let them come on us. 
A point apiece was a fair result. 
Ratings
CECH, 6 -- Had very little to do and was slow to react for the goal. He was obviously unsighted. 
AZPILICUETA, 6 -- Tidy player who defended reasonably. Not very adventurous going forward. 
CAHILL, 7 -- Solid at the back on the ground and in the air. Got the first header for our goal. 
IVANOVIC, 7 -- Like Cahill was solid and passed out from the back well, especially in the first half. 
COLE, 5 -- I don't know what was up with him. Slack in defence and rarely bombed forward. I suspect he was told to curtail his forward runs but that doesn't explain his careless defending. 
MIKEL, 7 -- Had an excellent first 70 minutes, pushing far further forward than usual. Had several opportunities to spring counterattacks in the second half and disappointingly chose to slow things down. It turned out we needed insurance. 
ROMEU, 4 -- Did very little and was rightly replaced at half time. His passes lack zip and a lazy square ball almost sent Swansea through. Can't see him featuring much this season. 
OSCAR, 6 -- Played centrally and showed many good touches without ever hitting top gear. 
HAZARD, 6 -- In and out of the game. When he's in it he looks dangerous. The player who moat looked like he missed Mata. 
MOSES, 6 -- Quick thinking to divert Cahill's header for the goal. Tracked back well and was threatening going forward without quite clicking with his colleagues. 
TORRES, 5 -- Had a decent first half, winning a lot of headers. Fine header in the first half was cleared off the line. Had a 2 on 1 break where he should have sent Hazard in in goal, but situated and blew it. In the second half, he was anonymous and sulky. 
Subs:
RAMIRES (for Romeu, 45 mins), 6 -- Injected some urgency, but was another who eventually dropped to a lower tempo. 
STURRIDGE (for Moses, 70 minutes), 5 -- Fell over (what's new?) when sent into the box with only a retreating defender to beat. 
BERTRAND (for Oscar, 80 minutes), 6 -- Confirmation we were shutting the game down. Did OK, but the loss of Oscar meant we posed little threat if adding a second
