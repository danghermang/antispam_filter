Subject:Re: [ncc-services-wg] Problem in payment of invoices
Dear All,

I just got answer from our bank. Payments in Russian Roubles are not
going through SWIFT system.

As I know, a lot of European (and not only European) banks can open and
use accounts in Roubles.

So, if RIPE NCC open a Rouble account, it will solve this problem, as
well as makes very happy the largest part of RIPE NCC members, i.e. LIRs
from Russia ;)
