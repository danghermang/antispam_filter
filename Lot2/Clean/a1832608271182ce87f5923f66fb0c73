Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] RMS power
Hi Bruce,

the link did not to work here.
So I tried entering just  '/458795/agl_spec_analyzer_basics.pdf'
in google.The same link showed up and did not work either.
But the google mode "quick view" worked and so I could see that it's just 
HP AN150,but the newer version from 1989.

[ The old version from 1974 can be found at the previous posted link for
download
if anybody is interested. 
http://www.hpmemory.org/an/pdf/an_150.pdf
However,this is the version from 1974,the newer version from 1989 has not
available there.]

The command "download" did not work so I resorted to" print" and used my PDF
viewer (pdf complete) as printer.
There are quite a few free pdf programs which can be used as printer like
e.g.foxit.
Thus I finally succeded in downloading this newer version of AN150,
thanks for digging it out.
