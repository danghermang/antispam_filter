The batteries started to "recover" while you still had your foot on
the accelerator because the controller was on 100% and your RPMs were
high enough that the current (and power) were falling.

With "full throttle" (voltage limited by batteries and current limited
by controller), as a series motor increases speed, power and battery
current go up until the back EMF of the motor equals pack voltage.
Above that speed, the power, motor current, battery current, and
torque all fall as the RPMs increase.

When you're in first gear accelerating, you exceed that speed and the
power falls, so the batteries see the load easing up and seem to
recover.

In second gear, your RPMs are low enough that you can still increase
power and acceleration with an increase in RPMs.
