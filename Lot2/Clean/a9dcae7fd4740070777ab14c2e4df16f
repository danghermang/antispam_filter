	Spurs [Telegraph]
[HS: Post-Spuds article that's made to look a bit less valid after
tonight, but still worth a read]

Another week dawns, bringing another week of challenges for Chelsea,
footballing challenges that the champions of Europe and Premier League
leaders are eager to accept.

By Henry Winter, Football Correspondent

Roberto Di Matteo=92s side face Shakhtar Donetsk away on Tuesday and
Manchester United at home on Sunday in a week which will give a greater
indication of their ability to add to their trophy cabinet.

They won the FA Cup and Champions League last season with a mixture of
defiance and organisation. Now they are a far more fluid force.

=93What has changed is our attitude,=92=92 reflected Di Matteo after a
deserved victory at White Hart Lane on Saturday. =93We go away and play
with the same attitude we have at home, so we take the initiative, we
don=92t just give it to the opposition. We want to impose ourselves,
whether away or at home.=94

What has also changed, self-=ADevidently, is the expansion of Chelsea=92s
creative department with the arrival of Eden Hazard and Oscar, forming
the three musketeers with Juan Mata, cutting defences like Spurs=92 to
ribbons. =93We have been lucky with the way the players we signed have
settled into the club quickly and into the Premier League,=94 Di Matteo
said.

=93That=92s thanks to the players already here, particularly with Oscar, as
the Spanish and Portuguese players have helped him integrate quicker. I
speak a little bit of Spanish with Oscar. He understands English if I
speak slowly. Eden understands English OK. Hazard has slotted in very
easily, like Mata last season, and they seem to have a good
understanding.=94

Mata gave an insight into the =ADsystem. =93The three behind the striker
[Fernando Torres] always try to play with movement, swapping positions
and trying to assist our striker,=92=92 said Chelsea=92s No 10. =93We have =
to
work in training but we are players who play like this naturally as
well. I don=92t think it is a surprise. Oscar, Hazard, Fernando are top
players. If you can win and also play really well, it is the perfect
way.=94

The man who brought Mata to England, Andr=E9 Villas-Boas, praised the
style of his old club. =93This fluidity they have with those three players
behind Fernando is tremendous and you have Victor Moses and Daniel
Sturridge on the bench, so it looks good,=94 the Spurs manager said. =93It=
=92s
difficult because these are players who can beat their man. If you press
or stay low these are players who can beat this kind of systems. At the
moment they are playing at tremendous level and to counter them is
extremely difficult.=94

Spurs tried in an entertaining game at the Lane. The first half was
good, spiced by Gary Cahill=92s volley to give Chelsea the lead. Mata
twice went close, as did Clint Dempsey before the excellent Ashley Cole
cleared a Jermain Defoe effort off the line. The second half was even
better.

The home dressing room staged an important confab at the break. =93We told
each other to press higher up the pitch because their centre-backs were
playing much too easily,=94 Jan Vertonghen said. =93When we pressed them we
had a few good chances.=94

William Gallas equalised, then Defoe pounced drawing praise from his
manager. =93He=92s picking up form and looking sharp and works well with the
team,=94 said Villas-Boas.

But there is such technical quality in Chelsea=92s side, such will to win.
Mata struck twice in three minutes, then created Daniel Sturridge=92s coup
de gr=E2ce. =93At the moment they=92re in form,=92=92 Villas-Boas said. =93=
Levels of
form are difficult to keep. Sometimes it takes a poor result to affect
your run and you have to bounce back like we have to now. The
Premiership is about these ups and downs and we have to hope.=94

Di Matteo was certainly not getting carried away by a four-point lead
over United and City. =93There has been a 10-12 points=92 advantage given up
by teams,=94 he warned. Mata said they must build on the start. =93We have
to try to translate this momentum into the whole season. In November and
in December you have a lot of games so we have to keep fighting for the
title in those two months. November and December are the most important
moments in the season.=94

Mata added that he hoped Villas-Boas would succeed at Spurs. =93He gave me
a lot of confidence to play at Chelsea in the beginning and I wish him
the best luck, not against Chelsea of course, but he is a very, very
good guy,=92=92 said Mata.

Spurs are still rebuilding, still dealing with questions. Are they
over-reliant on Gareth Bale? The Welshman missed the game as his partner
had gone into labour. =93He would have made a huge difference, he=92s an
amazing player but we respect his situation of course,=94 Vertonghen said.

Can Defoe and Emmanuel Adebayor play together? =93An option of two
strikers is one of our strongest possibilities,=92=92 argued Villas-Boas.
=93They linked very well and so it=92s something that can happen.=94 Can Sp=
urs
learn to sustain form for two halves, not one? Is Gallas still worth
persevering with? =93He is our captain and an important player,=92=92 repli=
ed
Vertonghen. Youn=E8s Kaboul is much missed.

Talking of absent centre-halves, John Terry starts against Shakhtar and
Mata will welcome him back.

=93For me and for the team-mates talking about him, he is always about a
legend,=94 Mata said. =93I am really good with him, happy to train and play
games with him. He is a really good guy. As a defender he is a key
player for us.=94

Harry
