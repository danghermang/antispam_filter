Hey space cadets,

It=92s been a crazy few months! We have been hard at work on something we a=
re
dying to tell you about - but not quite yet. However, because a lot of
people have been asking, here is the date of our favorite upcoming event:

*International Pillow Fight Day* - April 6th, 2013

Event hosts will be able to post their events on
pillowfightday.comstarting around New Year=92s. More news about our
newest project coming soon.
Sneak peek: We have figured out a way to turn the world into a giant party.
Stay tuned!
