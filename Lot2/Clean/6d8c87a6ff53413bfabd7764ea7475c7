Subject:[meteorite-list] Poles Unearth 300 kilo Meteorite



Hi, All,
 
An interesting article: http://phys.org/news/2012-10-poles-unearth-rare-kilo-meteorite.html
                        http://phys.org/news/2012-10-poles-unearth-rare-kilo-meteorite.html

"Polish geologists have unearthed the largest meteorite ever found in Eastern Europe and are hoping the rare find will provide fresh clues about the composition of the Earth's inner core, they said Wednesday....."

A "cone shape" is described - possibly nicely oriented?

Cheers,
Pete
