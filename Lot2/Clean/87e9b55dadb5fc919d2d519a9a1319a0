There is another possibility...   don't discontinue anything to
non-LRSA signees, but retain the usage "tracking" data necessary to
calculate a fee assessment amount for legacy holders who have not
paid, according to the ordinary fee schedule,  all past unpaid fees
since a certain date,  plus compound interest at prime rate plus 5%
over that period.    Require payment of the tracked amount, and signed
RSA, before any resources can be transferred in or out,  or new
resources can be  requested.

In this manner,  legacy holders  are still assessed the fees.
If they fail or refuse to pay, they are not denied   "legacy services".

There are no consequences until they need to transfer resources in or out,
or obtain new resources from ARIN  (e.g. IPv6 resources or additional AS number)
