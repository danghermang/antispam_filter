Subject:Re: [Flexradio] RFI on 10 meter
Check the wiring on the mic cable.  If it is a Heil cable, the MIC- and 
ground may be bonded (connected) together (they should not be connected) 
and the ground/cable shield may not be connected to the shell of the 
8-pin Foster connector (which it should).

Then try a ferrite bead on the mic cable.

Get great reports on audio on all bands, (haven't tested 6 meter yet, since I don't have an antenna for this band), but on 10 meter they complain about really bad RF in the audio. What can be the cause, and what can I do about it?
