Subject:[CT Birds] Hooded merganser @ Woods Pond, Norwalk.
Bunch if hooded mergansers at Woods Pond in Norwalk.  Nothing special, just  
the first i've seen of them this year.

Still no power for me here in Norwalk.  Took a drive along the shore today,  
but most beaches and coastal areas closed.  Lots of flooding.  No remarkable  
birds Id'd yet.  Will check photos when power comes back on.
