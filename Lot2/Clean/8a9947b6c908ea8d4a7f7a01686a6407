Subject:[Chelsea] Captain tonight?
Assuming that Cech is rested tonight, and Lamps and JT are out, who will be captain in tonights game? Ashley is one of the more experienced, but supposedly, he is also out of the game. I think it would be a good sign of support of the club towards Mikel, if he would be made captain for this game. It would make headlines, at least. A more likely bet, however, is Cahill, or Mata, if he'll play.
