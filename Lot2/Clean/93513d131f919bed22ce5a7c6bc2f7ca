Subject:[Koha] Switching from default to fast add framework is very slow...
Greetings,

When adding a new marc record i usually change the framework from 
defauit to the fast add framework and it is extremely slow in the 
transition.

It takes about 20 - 25 seconds just to change the framework.

Any tips on how to improve the loading time.

Running Koha version: 3.06.10.000

Previous versions loaded much faster than now

Regards,
Amir
