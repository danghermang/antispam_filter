I'm surprised that we wanted to postpone the sunderland game, given
that we already need to find an alternative date for the southampton game,
and we may also have a few more league cup games to fit in to our busy
schedule.

Why not  simply bring forward the kick-off of the sunderland game by a 
couple
of hours ? That would allow the team to fly out to Japan on saturday night, 
arriving
in Japan on sunday, a good 72 hours before the semi-final.

I'd be more concerned by the Leeds game on the 19th. With the late kick-off 
for
the world club cup final (19h30 in Japan), the team won't be back in the UK 
until
monday morning at the earliest. As the Villa game on the following weekend
has been moved to sunday 23rd (late kick-off), why not play Leeds on 
thursday
night, rather than wednesday night ?
