 Grimm Fairy Tales
I enjoyed this enormously UNTIL Neil said (and Philip agreed) that the stories had no context, just event after event after event and that's their glory. Hey, guys--these tales arose in a particular time, and even when they have moved through time, mouth to ear, to reach us, they still have the fingerprints of their making and remaking whorled into the body of the tales. Wicked women/witches/stepmoms or dark strangers in the woods who want to kill you, or the little man with the big nose and unpronounceable name who clearly wants your baby for some unspeakable blood rite though he never says so and by the way changes money (or was that straw into gold.) There's lots of context. So get out your fingerprint kit and be surprised.
