Subject:Re: [ARIN-consult] [arin-announce] Fee Schedule Change Consultation
Then as part of the restructure, let's let those that were suckered into signing
LRSAs thinking:

	A) Fees wouldn't be rapidly increased on us and probably wouldn't be
		increased other than incremental cost adjustments.
	B) It didn't make much difference since it was part of the $100 we were
		going to be paying for our non-legacy resources anyway.

For whom this proposal is a complete and abrupt turning of the tables
opt out of either the fee increase or the LRSA (without de-registration)
and go back to not having a contract and continuing to enjoy the free
ride.

Sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, the current state of the current proposal
is ARIN picking a fight with the legacy holders that fell for the LRSA.
