Subject:Re: [anti-abuse-wg] [db-wg] RIPE NCC's proposed implementation of
 Abuse Contact Management in the RIPE Database
Dear Alessandro,

The design does ease the fine tuning of abuse handling. By default the 
LIR's ORGANISATION object will reference the LIR's abuse handling ROLE. 
This is the root for all abuse handling for the resources allocated to 
an LIR.

If at some point a customer chooses to do their own management of abuse 
handling for their assigned address space you simply create the 
ORGANISATION and abuse ROLE objects for this customer and add the "org:" 
reference to this customers assignment.

The RIPE NCC will provide a tool for doing this in a single step.

If the customer changes their mind again and no longer wishes to handle 
the abuse themselves, you simply remove the "org:" reference from their 
assignment. Abuse handling returns to the LIR by default. The 
ORGANISATION and ROLE object will be deleted by the RIPE Database's 
automated cleanup process, after a short time, if no longer referenced 
anywhere else.
