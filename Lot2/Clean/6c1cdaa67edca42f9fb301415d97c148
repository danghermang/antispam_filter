Subject:[child_lit] David Almond on Skellig
Hi All

Apologies for cross-posting, but I thought many might be interested in
this. Apologies, too, if it's been mentioned before - and it passed me
by.  

However, on BBC Radio 4, there was a half-hour discussion with him and
an audience about the novel.

Best

David
