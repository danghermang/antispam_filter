Subject:Re: [EVDL] Cross Country EV?
Well actually you changed the parameters a bit with your statement: "It 
seems that the technology doesn't exist yet to drive cross country in an 
EV without stopping for recharging every 100 miles or so, give or take a 
few miles." The technology most certainly does exist, you just can't 
afford it. However if you add "inexpensive car" into the equation, you 
are correct.

As for your fantasy vehicle I guarantee it will  NEVER exist unless you 
want to add an inflation adjustment in there. We're pushing the bounds 
of the $20k car now.
