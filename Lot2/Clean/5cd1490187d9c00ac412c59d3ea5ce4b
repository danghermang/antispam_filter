Subject:[Flexradio] PTT issues
I have  small problem I could use som help with.

When I enable the PTT control to allow a digital program to key my Flex
1500 it starts to cycle the transmitter one and off on its own. If DTR is
check it cycles on for 2 seconds and off for 10 or so, if RTS is checked it
just flashes on every 10 secs of so. It doesn't matter what com port
is specified or if there is something connected to the other side of the
virtual cable. It also doesn't matter if any digital programs are running.
For example it does the same thing if mini-duluxe is on or off and if
ddutil is on or off, or both are on.

I am using psdr 2.4.4 and windows vista on an HP slimline computer

any thoughts.
