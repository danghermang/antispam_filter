Posted a note to the List before leaving RI this pm - perhaps it will appear in the next batch.

Bird was seen until 9 am in the northwest corner of the marsh - a panne complex visible on google maps.  Presently the tides are running the highest of the year - so the best times to see the bird will be early in the day and late in day.  The bird was finally located around 4 pm at the very east end of the marsh in panne - solitary bird - tail wagger.  Dozen or so yellowlegs around.

Here is a link to a google map which will help with directions to the marsh:  https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=214395385069048084569.0004cc71b1e0839d54ede&msa=0&ll=41.50918,-71.374676&spn=0.004531,0.009527

To get to the northwest panne - follow the trail that runs along the fence by the sewage treatment plant - walk is marked - follow this to an upright white pipe - just beyond on the left is the trail out to the marsh - at the marsh walk to the right you will see flagging ribbon on shrubbery - probably should not proceed further.

Bird is tame.
