Subject:[Flexradio] USB drive will not load
I have been using 2.4.4 for months now with no problems but did not try 
the 1500 until today, so today I did.  I am getting an error stating 
that windows 7 does not recognize the hardware.  The driver window 
popped up first saying driver loaded but not working, something like 
that.  I have tried multiple USB ports and cables.  Does the drivers for 
the 1500 interact with the VSP drivers in any way?  I have been 
rebooting after every uninstall and install to allow driver loading, etc.

I have uninstalled and re-installed 3 times with the same result.

I did notice that the un-install program does not completely uninstall 
the software so I am wondering if the drivers are getting deleted 
properly to allow a complete reinstall.

Any ideas would be appreciated.  And by the way, where is the install 
log located on windows 7 for PowerSDR?  That may allow me to find all 
the drivers and delete them by hand, if need be.

The program works successfully on my laptop but not on the main machine.

Thanks
