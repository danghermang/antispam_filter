Subject:[child_lit] Is it just me receiving, um,
	interesting e-mails via child lit?
Still on the case on the porno spam, and in discussion with Rutgers O.I.T. 

Could I ask people who received these interesting emails before October 29th to contact me and let me know when your first email arrived? 

More soon! 


Best, 

Michael (Joseph)
