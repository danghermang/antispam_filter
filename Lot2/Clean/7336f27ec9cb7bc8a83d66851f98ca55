Subject:Re: [child_lit] Who are you today? (snurched from YALSA-BK)
I've been Mother Goose all day, mostly as an excuse to use the bodice I
picked up at the RenFaire. We have a large goose in our library puppet
closet, so I've had it tucked under my arm (even around town! I took it with
me to Sonic for lunch).

The teen book discussion list YALSA-BK has asked its members if they dressed
up to go to work today, and asked who they were. There are three 10th
Doctors so far, and my favorite, the woman who got a WAAF uniform on eBay
and who is going as Verity in Code Name: Verity.

How about you, child_lit folk? Who are you dressing as for Halloween?

GraceAnne, who has a pumpkin fascinator to wear when kids come trick or
treating.
