Subject:[CT Birds] Geese at Broad Brook
10/26  4:30 PM  Couldn't resist heading back to Broad Brook after Tim's 
report.
With Annie and sisters, Tim and Joe(?), had 2 Greater white-fronted, 2 
Barnacle, 1 Snow, and saw Joe's pic of a Cackling but before I could get on 
it another couple hundred Canada's descended and conditions became a bit 
chaotic.  Hooded Merg was hanging in there along with several Mallard, a 
couple Cormorants and the hundreds (and rising numbers) of Canada's coming 
in for the night.
