Thanks! :)  I graduated three years ago (mature - well OK older than the =

Thank you again, and agreed! TBH I've never been a shrinking violet =

I've also had my fair share of 'Argh! Why didn't I think of that?!?' =

That's odd.  I know (as I've mentioned before) I am in South Wales not =

Devon/Cornwall, but I'm pretty sure we share the same timezone :)  I've =

it happens again I'll mention specific instances.

Kind regards,
