Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Capture Area
Alan P

On crystal sets, I have searched through a lot of crystal sets on
google and they all seem to used a wire antenna, with the ferrite rod
employed as a tuning coil.  I believe this is because a ferrite rod
antenna does not capture enough power to give an audible signal in
headphones, although obviously it would work if it was sufficiently
close to a transmitter.

Have you any calculations of the signal power captured by ferrite rod antennas?
