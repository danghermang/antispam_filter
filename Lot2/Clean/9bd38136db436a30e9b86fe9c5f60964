Almost.  Actually, I suspect that you have that backward.  My guess is that =

To be fair, it probably does cost that much - maybe even more - to produce =
a =

very limited number of vehicles like this one.  Not much economy of scale =

there.  =


However, a company that expects and wants success will price aggressively, =

in order to promote the market.  Toyota reportedly did that with the Prius.=

I've also read that Honda did it with the Accord when they introduced it in =

the 1970s.

I hope I'm wrong, but it would appear that Ford doesn't expect or want =

success for their Focus EV.
