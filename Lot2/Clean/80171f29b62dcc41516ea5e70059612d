While on a walk around the neighborhood and Mystic River with my daughter, =
we had flocks of birds everywhere, especially white-throats and juncos.=A0 =
The highlight was 5+ medium sized bats and a tooting saw-whet owl at the sa=
me time near the house while it was still fairly light out (5:45pm).
