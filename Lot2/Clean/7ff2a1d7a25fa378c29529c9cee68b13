Oh really, you are right!
Just checked the current downloadable version and it's indeed the lastest fixed version from advisories.
Was there maybe a time where they lagged behind for amd64 based linux flashplugin? Thought that last time
i checked for versions available.

Though from what i seem now could entirely possible be related to me not realizing that 11.2 is their
stable line and still getting security support.

sorry for the confusion!
