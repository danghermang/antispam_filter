Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Weird BPSK31 Behavior
Thanks to Jim, Dave and Rich for the really helpful replies.  I think Jim
was on to it as I can make the spike issue go away by changing sampling
rates.  However, I am still uncertain as to what in the heck changed because
of the Win 7 failure (still assuming that was the issue).

Things really got spooky here for awhile.  Suddenly the autotuner stopped
working; then the links to fldigi failed.  All for no reason that I can
tell.  Probably something stupid I did trying to find what had changed in
the settings, but beats me what it was.

So, ended up doing a factory default reset of all the database and starting
over.  This time I will NOT forget to make a backup of the database with all
my settings in place!!!! :(s

All seems to be working nominally now.  Still scratching my head how to deal
with the second transmit spike, but that will wait for after the ballgame or
tomorrow morning.

Thanks all.  This reflector is sure a big help.

73, Tom

I would double check the sample rates between VAC on PowerSDR and on the VAC
lines in the Windows sound settings. If one is set to 48000 and the other to
44100, your signal would not look so good. Perhaps you're unexplained
shutdown reset something. I keep both at 48000.
