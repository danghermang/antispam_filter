Sorry Lee, you are correct. I misspoke. I meant that the production  
vehicle doesn't exist yet in the $20k price range.

As for the charging infrastructure. It's NOT already there and  
publicly accessible without planning and making arrangements ahead of  
time with folks who will let you charge at their home or place of  
business for 6-10 hours.

Unless you put public charging stations in gas stations, I just don't  
see it. Sure there are outlets everywhere but "access" to those  
outlets is a problem.

NOTE: An EV conversion is not ideal because of  
reliability/dependability issues. I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable  
driving cross country in a conversion UNLESS it was a proven design.
