Subject:Re: [CT Birds] unusually birdy year
I am getting jealous!   I looked out my back window in the drizzle around 
7:00 am to find a teenager raccoon standing on my railing, pulling out the 
seeds with his hands.  In the daylight, no less!!!  Where are MY juncos and 
sparrows? They are in PAUL's yard!!!  And the rest of you have all the 
siskins!!!  I'll trade you my bear and raccoon for a handful of your 
birdies.
