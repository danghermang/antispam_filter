It isn't Flexens considering where Flex Radio is based.

Subject: [Flexradio] Fwd: Gerald Youngblood to Speak on the Future of Ham	Radio this Saturday
Date: Mon, Nov 5, 2012 10:12 am


Flexonians,

Please join us next Saturday, November 10th, at 9 AM in Atlanta to hear
Gerald talk about the future of ham radio. His talk promises to be filled
with great technical details and insights.

You will have a chance to have lunch with him following the presentation to
talk one on one.

Here are the logistics: http://hamjam.info/

HamJam is an annual event to raise money for youth scholarships. *Admission
is free* and 100% of the net proceeds go to scholarships. There are over
two dozen great prizes you can win including a Flex 3000 radio. Raffle
tickets are $5 each or five for $20. A complete list of prizes may be found
on the HamJam website.

I hope to see you there and please make sure we have an eyeball QSO if
possible. A video of the event will be available later after editing/etc.
