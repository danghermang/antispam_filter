   Hello braun as Welcome to this Tech Resources update from The Register

   Blue Coat Systems 2012 Web Security Report
   http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/975/5613a/4d5/4e590deb?td=3Dm_wpe=
_h

      Malnets (malware networks) have emerged as the next evolution in the
      threat landscape, enabling cybercriminals to launch dynamic attacks
      that are often undetected for days, sometimes months. This 2012 Web
      Security Report highlights how the threat landscape is rapidly
      changing, how you can build an effective malnet defense strategy and
      prepare for the onslaught of mobile device attacks.

A Decision Maker's Guide to Hybrid and Cloud Computing
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/983/5613a/4d5/ff092722?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   More IT organisations are achieving tangible cost efficiencies from the
   intelligent use of cloud computing and hosting solutions. At the same
   time, vendors are busy rebranding their products as cloud or cloud
   enabled solutions. How do you work out what can and will work for your
   organisation?

   This guide cuts through the jargon and gives you a straightforward
   explanation of cloud services, so that you can find the right solution
   to fit your organisations' needs.

Backup and Recovery of Large-scale VMware Environments
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/99e/5613a/4d5/dbb6e4cb?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   Organizations begin with IT-based applications residing in the data
   center and, after discovering the benefits and becoming more
   comfortable with the technology, they begin to expand virtualization
   deployments. As they start virtualizing user-facing applications, new
   challenges arise.

   For those applications, consolidation is not the focus; high
   availability and data protection are. As a result, any task that limits
   productivity or scalability, such as I/O-intensive backup, must be
   examined carefully.

   Traditional backup processes aren't always the best solution in virtual
   deployments. They weren't built for the extreme data redundancy and
   hefty server loads of consolidated environments.

Achieving Compliance in Digital Investigations
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9ce/5613a/4d5/7643670e?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   As regulation and litigation increase, internal investigators must
   support an alphabet soup of compliance obligations: SOX, GLBA, FISMA,
   HIPAA, PCI DSS, regional privacy laws, and more. Although each
   regulation is different, reflecting specific risks and markets, these
   laws share common investigation requirements in three areas: policy,
   control infrastructure, and incident response.

   Rather than prepare for and resource each compliance mandate
   separately, this paper demonstrates how in-house investigators can take
   advantage of computer forensics technology that supports these three
   key functions within a single base platform. We show how a common
   investigative infrastructure can enable appropriate investigative
   processes for disparate industry regulations and frameworks, and how it
   takes away the guesswork and reduces the risk. Plus, with this unified
   environment, enterprise teams - including HR, IT, and audit - can be as
   efficient as possible in responding to events and preparing audit- and
   court-ready materials.

   In this effort to comply more successfully and efficiently, remote
   forensics can be a force multiplier. Your limited investigation
   resources can go farther, faster. Trusted by investigators around the
   world, EnCase Enterprise provides a consistent, scalable, industry- and
   litigation-proven framework for investigating fraud, HR and information
   security incidents.

Getting started with the cloud
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9fb/5613a/4d5/a9026f9b?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   More enterprises are moving applications to the cloud every day,
   seeking faster implementation, more flexibility, and lower cost. But
   not everyone has a master plan; these decisions are sometimes made on
   the fly with little forethought.

   To help you succeed, this whitepaper presents a step-by-step guide to
   moving to the cloud.

Harnessing the benefits
http://whitepapers.theregister.co.uk/d/9fd/5613a/4d5/e2f69554?td=3Dm_wpe_h

   The internet, is bringing speed and efficiency to the dissemination of
   information, improving access to transactional services and making
   citizen interactions simpler and more convenient - whether that be a
   school-leaver applying for a student loan, an entrepreneur setting up a
   business for the first time, or a neighbourhood watch group
   scrutinising crime figures.

   Local and central government also has the need for technology
   applications to connect, mobilise and reduce the cost of internal
   processes. That means equipping the civil service to operate flexibly
   and productively, eliminating avoidable travel and promoting
   sustainability. These aspirations (which not coincidentally support the
   rationalisation of Government's large and diverse property estate) are
   driving the need to exploit mobile technologies, collaboration tools
   and audio and video conferencing.

   This white paper examines how a "buy not build" approach, analogous to
   the consumption of electricity and other utility services, can better
   meet government demand for compute resource.

Many devices, one policy
