Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] Book, Tucson Meteorite Auction,
 Reduced Web costs and expanded services (AD
Hi fellow cosmic adventurers,
        
        Several interesting suggestions for list members to check out which
consist of the following:

1) Check out my 400+ pg book on The History of The Meteorite
Market from 1997 through 2010 for only $14 even. I have yet to
have a single reader express the slightest disappointment & I have
Received many very positive posts from the few dozen readers who
have purchased this tomb of information which evokes many a memory
Of days, people and Tucson Shows gone by.

Checking out - and, of course, many other goodies of note.
