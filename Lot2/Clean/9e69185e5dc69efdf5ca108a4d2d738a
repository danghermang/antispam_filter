Hi Mike,

I would try overhauling the brake calipers next.  I'm told that the caliper piston seals are responsible for pulling the piston back into the piston cylinder - just a smidge - after braking but this is enough (or should be) to stop the pads from rubbing on the disks when the brakes are off.  When the seals wear this stops happening.  Refurb kits are not expensive and it's definitely a DIY job if your have the time, facilities and confidence.

The other possibility is warped discs.  The most common cause is over heating the discs due to very heavy braking.  They get so hot (red hot) that the disc metal softens enough to warp. This will be evident if the drag is intermittent as you turn the wheel.  Only solution to this is new discs.
