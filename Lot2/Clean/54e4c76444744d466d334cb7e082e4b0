Subject:Re: [EVDL] Cross Country EV?
Back in the 70's there was the Great Electric Vehicle Race across country =

which Bob Rice who was on this EVDL work for the Electric Fuel Propulsion =

Company drove one of there EV's.  There was the only one that made it to =

California. The other EV's did not make it pass Detroit.

Type in your search engine - The Great Electric Vehicle Race -

The EFP Co. set up the charging stations which look like large pad mounted =
3 =

phase 50 kva 250 volt delta transformers that could charge up to 200 amps. =

Many of the charge stations was a 50 amp 125/250 vac receptacles install at =

the Holliday Inns.

At that time many people said, I would not buy a EV, because it is too slow=
, =

takes too much time to charge it and does not have the range.

So this cross country race was set up to prove that it can be done.  My =

first EV which is call Transformer I was first tested out to see how far it =

can go in 24 hours and how well it can perform range, speed and fast =

charging before I received this unit.

EFP Co. base in Troy, Michigan, drove the EV for 1056 miles in 24 hours fro=
m =

Troy to Detroit to Chicago and back for 24 hours testing the charging =

stations they have set up on that route. This is a average 44 mph with 20 t=
o =

30 minutes of charging.

This EV had 3000 lbs of lead cobalt batteries rated at 300 ah at 180 volts. =

Use a 11 inch GE DC motor rated at 165 volts at 175 amps at 32 hp with =

electric filter air cooling blowers. The controller was a modified CableFor=
m =

900 amp controller air cool.

The batteries where discharge down to 40-50% SOC and only charge to 80% SOC =

at charge rates that started out at 200 amp, quickly drop to 150 amp and in =

20 to 30 minutes the batteries was up to 80%.

Did not finish charge the batteries above 80%, because this would take too =

long, remember this charging method was set up for the race.

After this test, I received this EV and drove it for another 10 years =

replacing only three cells.

I still have this EV, but have a spare WarP-11 motor and a Caf=E9 Electric =

motor controller and 180 volt battery pack using 30 each 250 ah 6 volt US =

Batteries.  Reduce the weight of the EV from 7850 lbs to 6800 lbs with me i=
n =

it. Estimate range is now 55 miles at 50% SOC.
