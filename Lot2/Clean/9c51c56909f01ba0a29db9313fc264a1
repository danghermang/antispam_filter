Subject:[Antenna-discussion] RE< Dipole impedance in real installation and
 comments about broadband three /five wires dipole
Dear amigo Lou>
You are talking about the antenna with a 4 inches diameter elements to 
each side
of the dipole... Right?
Then that will change if one places the antenna at say, 0.5 wavelength 
above the ground
Right ?
So , IMHO, the best option is to use a broadband dipole element... like 
for example
3 wires that spread from the center to form a geometrical figure of a 
triangle.
In actual practice there is no need to close the triangle sides at the 
end with a vertical
connecting wire..
That type of 3 to 5 wires broadband dipole element works very well, and 
you can model
it with EZNEC * a program that I do no have * and find out is excellent 
broadband
characteristics, as you sweep the frequency 50 percent up and down the 
center
operating frequency.
Such a dipole for 20 meters using 5 meters long wires , three on each 
side that are
separated by 2.5 meters at the end , has a very smooth SWR behavior, but the
impedance at the center is NOT near 50 or near 75 ohms, so the best approach
is to feed it with an open wire 350 ohms line.
