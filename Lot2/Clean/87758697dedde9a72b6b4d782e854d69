Subject:[child_lit] Articles on paranormal young adult lit
Good morning!

I just read Alyson Noel's FATED and think that I ought to delve into the paranormal genre a bit more than I have. Is all the new age pseudo Native American cultural ways a predominant theme in paranormal novels?! 

Here's my review, and I hope some of you who know the genre can direct me to some critical articles...
