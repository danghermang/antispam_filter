Subject:Re: [EVDL] Pack Cooling
""Bogus" ?
-Probably not.  But maybe a creative marketing department?
Does it say at what C-rate they have done the lab test ?  
I never trust it when marketing department produces the lab-charts."

I don't think it is bogus, nor created by a marketing department, and likely
used larger sample sizes than a 1 cell in the freezer test.  

Of course you can get all the charge out if you discharge slow, that's the
whole point.  The voltage sag at large discharge currents prevents you from
getting all the charge out before hitting the low voltage cutoff.  So as
Hoegberg says, such behavior makes the cells useless for EVs in very cold
temperatures.

The paper discusses two types of resistance, not just Ohmic.  I would guess
that the largest source of resistance at low temperatures is concentration
polarization due to difficulty in ions moving in/out of films at the cathode
and anode.  The ions introduce strain in the films when they move through,
as they are too large to easily fit.  Lattice vibrations likely facilitate
movement through the films, limiting movement at lower temperatures. 

Seems to me a Peltier effect device for cooling cells may cause problems due
to uneven cooling of the pack leading to some unbalancing of cells over
time.  I also doubt that cooling of the plastic case of large format cells
is very effective in controlling the temperature of the foils/films inside
at large discharge currents (>1C) due to the thermal gradient through the
cell.  I think any cool air flow should be directly on the terminals, and
uniform over all cells.
