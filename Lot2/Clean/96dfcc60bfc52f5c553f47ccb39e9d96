Hi Braun As,

All your users has a home computer, maybe a laptop, definitely a phone,
and likes to log in from someone else's computer from time to time.
They're carrying your data around, but often not your security policy.

Its hard to match policy from device to device, location to location.
If only it were possible to create a single policy and apply it to
multiple devices...

That is what Blue Coat thinks it can do. And with the correct policy in
place, it can actively monitor your security levels, so that your most
secure day is not the day after you create your excellent new policy,
just before the users break it.

Sasi Murthy from Blue Coat is in the studio, joined by Andy Buss from
analysts Freeform Dynamics and The Register's own Tim Phillips.
