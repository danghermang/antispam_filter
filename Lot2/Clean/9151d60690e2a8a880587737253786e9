I would at least try that--is the motor oiled, with 20 wt. motor oil ?

Hi Rich,

There is a 3 amp fuse for the motor. I could try substituting a 2 amp to gi=
ve a little greater margin of safety. I don't imagine a 1/30 hp motor would=
 draw much current other than at startup.

Thanks,

Bill

Bill, John,
My worry on this would be "fire"--and as such, I would at least add a "line=
 fuse" in the motor circuit--say 2-3 amp-- Ron Rich=20

These motors can get hot, but should not be sizzling (spit) hot!

You have tried running the motor through a complete cycle by hand (unplugge=
d!!!) to see if there is any binding?
