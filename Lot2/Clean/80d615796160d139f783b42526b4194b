Subject:Re: [child_lit] Blind protagonists
Follow My Leader by James B. Garfield is one I still remember from childhood (boy blinded by fireworks, it's about his relationship with his guide dog)

The Trouble with Tuck by Theodore Taylor is about a dog with a guide dog.  The dog is actually buried at the Presidio cemetery in San Francisco (since I know that  you're a Bay Area person like I am).  :-)
