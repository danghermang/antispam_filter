Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Year of the woodswallow?
Can someone tell me where do the ratios of White-browed to Masked reverse? Up North it's mostly Masked with smaller numbers of White-browed, here it's the reverse. What happens in the middle? Are there evenly balanced flocks? Or is there just a line? Weird!!!!
By the way we have had flocks of woodswallows turn up over the last week and a half in the South East of SA.
