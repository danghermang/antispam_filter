Subject:Re: Iceweasel 17.0 problem and solution
Hello Everyone (new here!)

 * Everybody noticed that :
    # Issuing sync operations on an ext3 file system will lead to I/O
spikes, as every dirty pages in cache are going to be flushed to disk
(that can take ages)
    # The problem is ext3fs filesupport for barriers, which is kind of "bog=
us".
    # ext4 and XFS do support barriers.
    # you can mount an ext3 device ext4 on Squeeze

 * As it's been said,
    # the backports itself is not the cause of the problem.
    # However, installing IceWeasel~bpo will need users to
      1. upgrade their filsystem to get advantage of the features using fsy=
nc
      2. disable fsync in Iceweasel and pray for your data

 * One should try solution 1) as mounting ext3 to ext4 is supported on sque=
eze
    # try and mount all ext3 partitions to ext4 with default journaling sch=
eme
    # reboot, test IceWeasel -> should be much better
    # your can try different journalling options  data=3Djournal vs
data=3Dordered and
    # compare the perfs with IW17 + ext3 raw, then solution2, then
solution1 + different journalling options for ext4

Hope that can help. Won't have time to test this WE I'm affraid
