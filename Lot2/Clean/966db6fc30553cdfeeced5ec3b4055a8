Subject:Re: [child_lit] Younger reader/ MG titles with girl protagonists
	(Abigail Moller)
One of my recent favorites in this area is Clay Carmichael's "Wild Things,"
about a young girl from a troubled background who goes to live with her
half-uncle, and slowly learns that some adults can be trusted. It's an
immensely engaging story, and one of the best-written children's books I've
read of late. It also has a very winsome cat character (always a plus, in
my book).
