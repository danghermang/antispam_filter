But you clearly didn't see Mikel drop back into Luiz slot when he tried
his slalom run? Or the lucky ricochet that went to the Man utd player
who passed to Anderson...or the anticipation and movement that Hernandez
showed to run through our defenders?

It is true that one meter beyond the halfway line is technically "in the
opposition half". 

It is also true that if a central defender "runs with the ball" to that
position, then not only loses it, but more or less hands it on a plate
to the opposition, who then one millisecond, is no longer on the
opposition half, but on OUR half, being able to run directly with the
ball with several attackers at a defence with huge holes in it, due to
the horrendously stupid action of that now absent defender, then it will
be very difficult for the remaining defenders. 

I also saw Luiz make good interceptions. I also like centre halves to
run with the ball, but when they do, they have to do that with
judgement, in a way that is not equally crucial for an attacking player.
Otherwise, situations exactly like the Man U 1-2 goal yesterday happens.


Unfortunately, having "David Luiz" and the word "judgement" in the same
sentence is rarely adequate, unless there is a negation somewhere.
