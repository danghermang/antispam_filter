Subject:[CT Birds] Bats, not birds
From Frank Mantlik-
10/22. During my drive south on the Merritt Pkwy from Stratford to Westport, 6:00 - 6:30pm, I counted an amazing 31 flying/ foraging bats. They all looked to be a fairly small species, but of course that could be difficult to judge while driving the speed limit. I thought this quite noteworthy.
Earlier in the afternoon, I also saw a Red Bat over the Boothe Memorial Park hawk watch site.
