You *did* install using LVM2, right? Even if you didn't, resize2fs to
the rescue. It's pretty trivial to change partition/volumes sizes and
indeed most other disk parameters after the install.

Obviously you need to backup your data first though, just in case. I've
actually never lost data in all the hundreds of times I've resized and
modified disk layouts but I imagine the first time you're too confident
and don't bother backing up, that's when it's suddenly going to fail
mid-operation.

Personally I never define a separate /home partition and just leave it
under / so my OS disk layout is just /boot and / - this workstation has
16Gb RAM so I don't even have a swap partition.
