Subject:[EVDL] Advancing Motor Timing pros/cons/ accel efficiency

Hi,
I was just told that advancing the timing 12 degrees(hole setting) on my warfield Warp "Impulse 9" would would stop the uphill smoke smell at 500A at 3K rpm's 120Vdc on my www.evalbum.com/4346 2300lb Ghia while the new brushes break in.  Is there any science/studies that indicate less brush stress at 120Vdc 3K rpm's with advanced timing.
I generally have run neutral setting on my past motors (and this one) ADC, GE, Prestolite as I seam to get better efficiency (less amps on accel) at the neutral position and my max RPM's with a transmission are 3K at 60 mph going to work on the freeway (70 miles daily, 350 miles week).  I thought advanced timing only helps at 5K rpm's and at higher voltages and then for best accel has to start at 0 degrees & change (variable) with speed like a centrifigal ICE distributor.
