Subject:[burners] Ballot on Election Day, Tue Nov 6th from 7am to 8pm
Hello Burners, it=92s almost Election Day [Tuesday November 6th from 7am to=
 8pm] here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Guess what? Whether you like it or not, voting touches on at least three of=
 our eleven principles: Civic Responsibility, Communal Effort, and Particip=
ation=97and probably more.

Ya don=92t gotta if ya don=92t wanna, and no, I=92m not going to tell anyon=
e how I think they should vote=97this is a community civics email, not a po=
litical one. This is just to let you know what=92s coming down the Pike on =
Tuesday Nov 6th.

Here=92s a super-useful site that will not only tell you where you are supp=
osed to go vote (your polling place) it will show you exactly what is on yo=
ur particular ballot:

http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/

In addition to lots of government officials, this year there are three stat=
ewide referenda, and several non-binding referenda in certain localities. W=
hile the website above will have most all the info you need, I shall includ=
e the ballot question information for each in three separate threads to fol=
low.

And for anyone who has snarky doubts about the appropriateness of these thr=
eads, please understand that rather than discussing politics, these threads=
 are intended to discuss actual direct policy-making=97by us! How cool is t=
hat? Politics can go suck an egg. Policy is where it=92s at=97especially po=
licy that touches on Participation, Communal Effort, and Civic Responsibili=
ty.

All The Best,
