Ron,
  Darn, I guess it won't be that easy, BUT still doable,  apparently I misr=
ead your name earlier, many apologies.  I got a manual for the continental =
2 that was emailed to me off a cd manual.  I know the cd is supposed to hav=
e more info on it, but the seller "forgot" to include it when sent and has =
refused to respond to emails.  Even though it's a minor cost it's still fru=
strating that it was included but now I have to buy one again for the compl=
ete set of documentation.
  Still any  mm2 or 3 button assembly info would be much appreciated.  Even=
 a detailed wiring diagram of the button assembly off the continental 2 wou=
ld help.  If I can't find plugs I will just solder pigtails on the back of =
the plug wires and add newer plugs in place.  This will make my changes rev=
ersible.
Thanks for your help!
Ed

Ed,
You have mis-read--the Conti coil only operates for a "second" upon "power =
up" or a credit switch being "triggered", and after a selection has been co=
mpleted.=A0 If you turn the power off on the Conti, the keys will still "lo=
ck down". They "pop up" as power is applied, and/or a credit is added, so t=
hat it is not possible to make an un-wanted selection. Ron Rich=A0=20

Rob,
=A0 After reading the manual last night the continental does it opposite I =

ant to use the in place circuit for the mm3 latch coin while I already have=
 it.=A0 Rather than redoing it. Ed

Ed,
If memory serves me well, the Conti only "pulses" the latch solenoid upon p=
ower up, or after a selection is made to UN-Lock the latchbar.=A0 Later pho=
nos provide power to the solenoid and hold power on, as long as there are u=
n-used credits.=A0 This system relaxes the solenoid, when there are no un-u=
sed credits.=A0 Ron Rich=20

Rob,
=A0 Thanks, if you wouldn't mind sending me the page that describes the lat=
ch circuit for the MM-2, I bet they are close enough that I can figure out =
what the MM-3 is trying to do.=A0=A0=A0I should have both 30 dc and 30 ac a=
t the button panel, and even though the continental 2 operates the latch so=
lenoid the opposite way they both energize the latch relay the same way I s=
hould be fine.
=A0 Once I find extra sockets and plug I will start morphing the two togeth=
er.=A0 Soon I'll be able to actually use my continental!

Ed, I only have diagrams for MM-2 but as for voltages -all Rowe machines of=
 that era used 30vac for the latch solenoid which was controlled by a 30vdc=
 relay.

The solenoid should be easy since it was common to so many models, the link=
age -may- vary.

Hello,
=A0 I have a Rowe Ami MM3 button assembly, not the entire jukebox.=A0=A0=A0=
What is the voltage of the latch solenoid?
=A0 Does anyone have a diagram or schematic that describes the circuit for =
the latch solenoid?=A0 Maybe one for the selection circuit?
 I wish to use the original latch and hold circuit or something close to it=
.

=A0 I have asked a lot of questions but not specific enough and have gotten=
 no reply's, so here I go again.
