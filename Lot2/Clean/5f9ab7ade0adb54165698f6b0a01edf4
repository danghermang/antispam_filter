Subject:Re: [h-cost] h-costume Digest, Vol 11, Issue 242


 How many relatively accurate (for any period) premade historic 
embroidery designs are out there? Is it essential to digitize most of 
your own to get anything decent?

Not many pre-existing ones, but if you find a good digitiser, you can commission quite a few. Most charge by the stitch which can make it expensive for satin stitch and totally filled designs, but for blackwork and such, they can be relatively small and therefore reasonably priced. It all depends on how much you are really going to do. Claricia
