Though I may come to regret it, I'll dive into this pool. I haven't read ENDANGERED yet--I'm currently in Portugal and not having the easiest time getting new books--but I do remember THE HONORABLE PRISON quite well. The novel was published in 1987 or 1988 and covered events that took place in an unnamed South American country in the early 1950s, thus meeting the 20-year threshold to be considered historical fiction. Given that the author grew up in Colombia and stated that much of the novel (which grew out of a short story published in the New Yorker) was autobiographical, I assume she had her reasons for not identifying the country as Colombia even though the setting and events matched up. Perhaps she wanted to make the point that similar events took place in many Latin American countries at the time of the novel--as well as in the 1980s when THE HONORABLE PRISON came out. Perhaps she still had family in Colombia and didn't want to expose them; after all, Colombia was a pre
 tty violent place in the late 1980s. However, I don't think setting a historical novel in an unnamed country should automatically disqualify it for a content-based award, though it may be a red flag for other problems related to accuracy and authenticity. Antonio Skarmeta's picture book THE COMPOSITION, for instance, deservedly received the Americas Award in 2000 despite being set in an unnamed country. (The short story from which THE COMPOSITION is adapted is set in Chile, and Skarmeta is a Chilean writer.)

Hope this helps. Overall, I'm finding this to be a fascinating discussion.
