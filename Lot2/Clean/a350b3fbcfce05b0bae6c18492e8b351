Neymar seems a bit lightweight and flashy, does he have the substance to
succeed in the Prem straight away? Also prone to diving. I suppose we could
have asked if Oscar is strong enough to succeed and he is doing fine. And I
really haven't seen enough of Neymar to form a firm opinion. Perhaps doing
him a disservice, after all he is generally talked about in the same breath
as Ronaldo and Messi which is no mean feat.

By the way Falcao does free kicks too. Scored a nice one last night. Have
seen enough of him to be firmly convinced he is the best striker I have
seen, and is guaranteed to score a Boeing 747 load of goals if he comes to
us. So no prizes for guessing who I want.
