Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] The birds and the bees - nectar feeders
Musk Lorikeets returned to the Clarence Valley, north coast NSW, in late 
October after an absence of many months.  Last week I had the four lorikeet 
species at home at Coutts Crossing - Rainbow, Scaly-breasted, Musk and 
Little.  Maybe not large numbers but the flowering Silky Oaks and some 
eucalypts are keeping the lorikeets around.  The Musk Lorikeet is irruptive 
in our area and probably travels from more temperate regions such as 
southern NSW and Victoria when nectar is scarce there.

Subject: [Birding-Aus] The birds and the bees - nectar feeders

Hi all,

I've just heard an interesting report on ABC Radio Australia about the fact 
that commercial beekeepers, in terms of nectar production, are having one of 
their worst seasons on record. The report suggests, that due to our wet 
winter and cool spring, trees and shrubs are putting all their energy in the 
development of green growth rather than flowering. See

http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2012-11-12/falling-nectar-production-leads-to-honey-drought/1044622.

Anecdotally, I also think the lack of flowering has had an impact the number 
of nectar feeding birds i.e. our honeyeaters and lorikeets. Personally I've 
noticed far less lorikeets about the place. For instance, just this morning 
on my ride to work (through Royal Park in Melbourne) there were virtually no 
lorikeets. Interestingly the main type of lorikeet I did see (hear) was 
Little Lorikeet.

The report concludes that our plants are still growing but it will take 12 
months to see the benefits, and that this time next year we'll be having a 
good honey season. I'm speculating that the same applies to our nectar 
feeding birds, certainly across southern and eastern Australia. In theory 
spring 2013 will be the 'year' of the nectar feeders!

Cheers,

Tim
