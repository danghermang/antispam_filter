Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas

If you can find a lossless ferrite antenna it will be the first.  The
figure I quoted, 70 dBs loss at 1 MHz, is quite typical and I have
shown how that figure can be incorporated into a system design for
transistor radios, which is the only widespread application these
antennas have found in the market-place.  An important question is to
ask yourself why that is . . :)

At lower frequencies the losses become even larger, but lossy
receiving antennas are more acceptable because of the extremely high
level of external noise at low frequencies.

Alan P. has derived loss resistances between 1 and 10 ohms in a
typical case, while stating that a typical radiation resistance is
10^-6 ohms, implying typical losses of somewhat more than 60 dB, so
this idea of lossless ferrites is a misrepresentation.

You still refuse to consider details, but all you need to do is
calculate the radiation resistance and inductance of one of these
antennas.  As long as you continue to keep your head in the sand you
will stay as you are now - in a state of blissful ignorance :).
