Subject:Re: [EVDL] Precharge / Discharge
Lee and Cor,

Thanks your for your extensive replies.

The OpenRevolt controller is 12 volt powered and does not include any
internal bleed on the pack circuit.

The point is well taken about locating the +/- pack voltage on nearby
terminals, so perhaps the fixed bleeder is the best choice.  I like the idea
of a light bulb or other indicator.  However, it still isn't fail safe.  I
am puzzling whether to have an indicator which might be better than nothing,
or not to have an indicator since it's failure would impart a false sense of
security.  Perhaps I need dual discharge paths and dual indicators.  Or,
perhaps, I'm over thinking.

Thanks again,
Mike
