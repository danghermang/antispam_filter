Subject:Re: [Chelsea] It's Only Rock n Roll
I totally agree with all of that Dave.  The only nit picky point I'd make is that, by their own hand, they don't have to prove anything, just guess that he probably did or didn't.  And that the probability was lowered, by their own hand, only weeks before Terry's case was heard.  If someone heard it, or saw it on YouTube or whatever, no matter what the character references, no matter that those mic'ed up missed it, then it probably happened.  No?

The one element of the affair I find it almost impossible to comprehend is that all commentators and bloggers, scribblers and opinion merchants seem to agree that CFC were not only correct, but "duty bound" to raise this complaint once it had been brought to their attention by witnesses to the alleged Clattenburgian mis-speaking.

If they were "duty bound" to pursue the complaint as everyone agrees, how can the name of CFC be besmirched on the basis merely of having  raised that complaint? It just doesn't make any sense.......

A lot of people/blowhards/commentators seem to be in effect saying "CFC are so steeped in toxicity that irrespective of the outcome of this latest manifestation of FA-connived hysteria, they must suffer the consequences of simply being CFC - namely, a repository of all that's evil and rotten in the game".
