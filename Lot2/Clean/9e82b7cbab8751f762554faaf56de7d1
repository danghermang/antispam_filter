Hi Braun As,

Does deliver early, deliver often equal deliver badly? Some Reg
readers think so. This is what a few of you tell us about agile
development: "Often of a lower standard and the system will
inevitably be less reliable". "If you don't have good people,
you're screwed". "It leads to several wheels being reinvented in
disparate ways".

Ouch.

Not everyone agrees though. Perforce doesn't and nor do its clients -=20
small names like Salesforce.com, Pixar and Nvidia. That's why we have
Perforce's Mark Warren in the studio to discuss how to do agile
properly: why it's needed, the right way to go about it and how to
avoid the mistakes that hobble it.

He's joined by Dale Vile from Freeform Dynamics who is here to
tell you what you already told him when he researched it. Hey!
Don't blame Dale, he's an analyst, it's what they do. His slides
are world class.

Tim Phillips will be pretending to keep control, and putting your
questions to Mark and Dale.

Join us on tomorrow (September 18th). It's live and completely free!
