Subject:[Jukebox-list] Wurlitzer 1250 speaker grill
Hi all:

 

In the process of restoring my 1250, I found that the metal grill of perforated steel covering the speaker (now looking almost
monotone red and rust!) was originally painted, with a back bright orange color, and over it, some pattern made out one sort of
romboidal design painted in dark red repeated throughout the whole grill. The general aspect is red and the orange serves only to
make the dark red design stand out a bit when viewed up close. On top of all that, and only in the upper part of the grill, there is
another design, flowerish abstract type, which I guess should be painted in a contrasting color, gold or yellow, perhaps.

 

We were able to replicate the design (with the help of a friend doing design work and printing), and we have a few parts on which
the original bright orange and red can be seen well enough as to duplicate the colors, but my question is how this upper design that
gets painted over everything should be painted? I am asking about color. I saw a restored 1250 which had it in bright yellow and I
really didn't like it much. I sort of think that it should be done in golden paint. Does anybody know what color was that original
design painted?

 

Thanks,

victor
