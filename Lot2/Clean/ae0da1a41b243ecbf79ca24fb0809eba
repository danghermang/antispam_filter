Too true. There aren't even that many ICE vehicles available for under 
$20 any more. :-(

My old friend Bob Rice designed the Sebring Vanguard Citicar EV. In 
1975, it listed for $2795, and they sold *thousands* of them. A VW 
Beetle was over $3000 at the time.

But today, no one seems capable of selling an EV today for less than 
$40k, while ICEs sell for 1/3 of that.

Actually, it *is* if you live in the northern US. I've lived in NY, 
Michigan, and now Minnesota. In all these states, free public AC outlets 
are everywhere, and have been for many decades. They are put there for 
ICE block heaters, so your car will start in the winter. You will find 
them at every motel and apartment, and many businesses. Outdoor outlets 
have been required by the building codes for decades, so they are found 
on almost every building.

I've been driving EVs since the 1970s, and have *never* been denied 
permission to use them.

Whether a car is a conversion or not has little bearing on its 
reliability. This is really a quality and competency issue. There are 
some mechanics whose work is liable to leave you stranded or get you 
killed! And there are others that do flawless work, every bit as good as 
the factory.
