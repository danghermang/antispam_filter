Hey Donna,

Not sure if you're still looking for titles on loss and grieving, or if
these have been mentioned before, but here a few more great books:

MOCKINGBIRD by Katherine Erskine -- death of a brother, where the
protagonist is autistic

WINTERGIRLS by Laurie Halse Anderson -- death of a best friend, where the
protagonist suffers from anorexia

PLEASE IGNORE VERA DIETZ by A. S. King -- Death of a best friend, and
abandonment by mother

ELSEWHERE by Gabrielle Zevin -- death of the protagonist

THE TRUTH ABOUT FOREVER by Sarah Dessen -- death of father

Cheers,
Rilla

Hello everyone-



I've been a list member for a number of years and always find everyone's
contributions so helpful.  So, I am reaching out to all of you.  I am on
the board of directors for the National Alliance for Grieving Children (
http://childrengrieve.org/).  NAGC provides a network for nationwide
communication between hundreds of children's bereavement support
professionals and volunteers who want to share ideas, information and
resources to support the families they serve in their own communities. We
also promote national awareness to enhance public sensitivity to the issues
impacting grieving children and teens.  In 2008, Children's Grief Awareness
Day was instituted and this November it will on November 15, 2012.



We need your help.  We would like to build a "library" of relevant and
helpful books on our website and would like your suggestions for books
featuring children and teens who have experienced a loss and are grieving,
or books with themes of death, healing and resilience.  We are looking for
books appropriate for all ages, picture books, chapter, YA.



Of course, we'd like to cite you as a contributor to our library resource
section.



Thanks so much for your help!
