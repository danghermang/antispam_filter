Subject:Re: [child_lit] Request for titles-loss, grieving, resilience
Hi,

A few that I love:

Zetta Elliot (illus Shadra Strickland) - Bird. In this book the child is
grieving for his brother who has died as a result of drug abuse. It also
explores him coming to terms with the way the brother's actions before his
death have impacted on the family. I particularly like this one because it
recognises that the deceased might not be perfect, but that we grieve for
them anyway.

Judith Kerr - Goodbye Mog. This might have been mentioned before, but it's
so good it deserves a mention anyway. A family friend who was diagnosed
with terminal cancer used it to help her talk to her children about her
death.

Cynthia Voigt - Dicey's Song. This is part of the Tillerman cycle but it
can be read alone (this was the first one I ever read, in fact). Deal's
with the death of Dicey's mother after a long illness. I like the fact that
all the children in the family deal with it in their own ways.

Cynthia Voigt - Tell Me if the Lovers are Losers. This is a really old book
and I'm not sure if the 1970s context for the story would be offputting to
a reader now, but it's so good that I'm recommending it anyway. Deals with
a group of college girls and the death of one of them. Cynthia Voigt is
good at recognising grief as devastating while also focusing on the way you
learn to live afterwards.
Jacqueline Woodson - If You Come Softly and its sequel Behind You. Deals
with a young couple's love affair, the death by shooting of the boy, and
(mostly in the second book) the aftermath.
