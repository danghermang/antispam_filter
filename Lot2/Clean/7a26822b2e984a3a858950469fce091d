eed transparency in transaction pricing. &nbsp;Otherwise there will continu=
e to be black markets and unscrupulous operators. &nbsp;I view my job as fi=
nding buyers to match sellers and finding sellers to match buyer needs. &nb=
sp;Just as in stock markets, commodity markets, and housing markets, IPv4 m=
arkets require open pricing. &nbsp;Only then will most people give this mar=
ket legitimacy and most of the devious behaviour go away. &nbsp;</div><div>=
<br></div><div>Further, other RIR policies need to morph to support open-ne=
ss. &nbsp;For example, RIR's should not reclaim unused IP's now that they h=
ave value. &nbsp;Global barriers to trade (think inter-RIR transfers) have =
to come down so that prices in one part of the world are not different from=
 other parts. &nbsp; Although this is a little off-topic, the use of needs =
justification is a huge barrier to honest and open trade (as per Milton's w=
orkshop in Baku earlier this week). &nbsp;Companies are doing some very cre=
ative things to avoid the RIR justification process and as a result the reg=
istries are getting less accurate, and the RIR's spout community credos rat=
her than really look at the problem. &nbsp;The good news is these problems =
should be gone in 50 years when IPv4 is finally replaced by IPv6!</div><div=
