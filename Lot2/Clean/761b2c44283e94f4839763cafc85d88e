Jim.  I'm in Southern Ontario about 2 miles from the north shore of Lake
Ontario.  Sandy brought us wind gusts up to 100km /hr for about 24 hours =
on
Monday.  We are now pretty much right under the eye of what's left of =
the
storm and there's been a light rain for several days now. =20
Expect sunshine for the weekend.  No damage to property but did get a =
bunch
of leaves onto the backyard pool cover.
