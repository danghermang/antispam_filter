Subject:Re: [burners] Subject Line helpful?
On the controversy over posting commercial events on the BBurners list:
   Some have suggested that unwanted email can be evaded by looking at the Subject Line.  This is a hit-and-miss proposition.  For example, if the subject line is Burners Digest, with any Volume number and Issue number, you can usually figure that there will not be any Digest.

i once had a fleeting romance with a beer named Mirror Pond. it was
all fireworks and earthquakes at first kiss.
can't find her in Mass. but i believe she comes from Portland. find
her and love her for me.

 I miss you all.

 As much as I love being in VT for school... I miss Boston with such a
 passion. Nevertheless, I've found the perfect internship as a costume
 designer(!) aaaaalllll the way in Portland, OR! I'll be there for two
 months starting next year, and I'm checking out the Portland burner
list-
 but I'm wondering if any of YOU pretty people know where I can find
other
 people who are just as pretty!

 Got any favorites I should say hello to? The local bicycle makers
gang?
 Maybe a secret Portland warehouse that throws dinosaur/horn/sexy
themed
 parties? A place where I can ride a giant robotic six-legged beaver
(the OR
 state animal)? Give me your inside scoop!
