Subject:[child_lit] Appalled
I have a new blog with reviews of Kid Lit books about politics.  On Friday I
read a book entitled "A Kid's Guide to The Voting Process (Vote America).
It was published by Mitchell Lane Publishers.  I was surprised at the number
of inaccuracies.   An example is on page 42, where the text states that
Jefferson and Madison started the Democratic party.  In fact, Jefferson and
Madison started the Democratic-Republican party and Andrew Jackson and
Martin Van Buren started the Democratic party.  On page 30 "Every state also
has its own constitution.  Each of these important documents outlines all
the laws for that state."  ALL of them???  On page 25 "The candidate with
the most electoral votes becomes the nominee for that party."  At every
convention I've ever watched, it's delegate votes, not electoral votes, that
were important.

 

OK, enough ranting about inaccuracies.  After reading the book, I happened
on this Publisher's Note on the flip side of the title page "The facts on
which this book is based have thoroughly researched.  Documentation of such
research can be found on page 44.  While every possible effort has been made
to ensure accuracy, the publisher will not assume liability for damages
caused by inaccuracies in the data, and makes no warranty on the accuracy of
the information contained herein."

 

Has anyone else seen anything like this?  Is this some problem with Mitchell
Lane Publishers?  Do publishers really regularly publish non-fiction books
with such a disclaimer?  I can't find a disclaimer in any of several
non-fiction books I looked at.  How can a buyer, especially one buying off
the internet, tell if a publisher has published a traditional, fact-based
non-fiction book or if the publisher has essentially published a book that's
as reliable as Wikipedia?
