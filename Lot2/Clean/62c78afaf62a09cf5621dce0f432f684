Subject:[LUG] 3d engineering
I'm trying to get some work done in Elmer or gmsh  but find the model 
building a bit slow and error prone.
There's wings3d or blender which are a bit quicker at building models 
but cant convert to engineering grade formats.
Has anyone experience of weapons grade work of this sort and can point 
me to some converters or something?
Tom
