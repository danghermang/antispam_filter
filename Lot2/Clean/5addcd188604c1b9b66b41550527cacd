The "audit" that is referred to here is the small audit that we have =
always
done when evaluating an additional allocation request. It is not the
full LIR audit that we conduct as part of our Audit Activity, nor is it
something new.

It mostly concerns cleaning up exsting records such as:

- LIR contact details that are out of date
- PA approvals that are no longer in use
- Direct assignment customers for whom the LIR is no longer the =
sponsoring LIR
- Invalid assignments in the RIPE DB

Experience shows that in the vast majority of such evaluations, there =
are
at least a few records and registrations that are out of date and have =
to be
corrected and that this is rarely a lot of work.

The RIPE NCC has always considered this to be part of the basic =
due-dilligence
required to keep records correct and up to date.
