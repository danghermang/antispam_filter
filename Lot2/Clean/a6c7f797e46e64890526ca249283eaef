Subject:[bcp] ad-hoc Ride
If you want further information about this ride PLEASE CONTACT the ride leader(s). A new ride, which is a ad-hoc/Add-on has been added to the ride list.  This is a description of the ride: 

Sun November 11, 2012 -  Sunday Funday  (ad-hoc ride)  meet at Italian Fountain behind the Art Museum (http://phillybikeclub.org/newbcp/rides/class?id=4#4 is the link for information about the start location.). The ride leaves at 10:00 am. Class b-/b, 14.5-15mph, 25-35 miles, We don't know where we are going, but we sure know where we've been. If you are a decent rider and don't mind the unknown, this is a great ride. We often make it up as we go but expect a fair amount of climbing (about 1500 feet), maybe a lunch stop OR post-ride beers, a 1-2 pm finish time and good conversation. Over 30% chance of rain, possible hurricane, snow storm, earthquake or wet roads cancels the ride.
  Cue sheets will not be available. 

You may preregister until Saturday, November 10, 2012 at 8:00 pm 
 It is optional but if you wish to preregister for this ride then use the link that follows:
