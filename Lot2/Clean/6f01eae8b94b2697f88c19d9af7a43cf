<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:16px;">And really, calling it an MP3 player or a =

<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:16px;"><strong>With a 5 Megapixel built-in camera=
</strong>, you'll ALWAYS be ready to take the perfect picture. Plus it's de=

<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:16px;"><span style=3D"color:#ff0000;"><strong>Or =
maybe you want to record some video? Easy! </strong></span>You can record u=

 cool effects!</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:16px;"><span style=3D"color:#0000ff;"><u>It even =

upports pretty much any audio file you'll have, from MP3 to WMA.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:16px;"><strong>You don't even need headphones to =
