Star's disabled parking gaffe

Exclusive
By ALEX WEST

ROBIN van Persie gets into his car =97 after leaving it in a disabled
space for three days.

The Manchester United ace flouted car park rules to leave his flash Audi
A5 near the exit.

Van Persie, 29, parked in the disabled bay at Manchester Airport last
Tuesday before flying off with his team for a Champions League match in
Portugal.

He returned on Thursday afternoon to pick up his car, and drove off with
team-mate Alexander Buttner.

An onlooker said: =93He didn=92t seem to care that he left his car in a
disabled bay for 48 hours.

=93It wasn=92t even parked in the space properly. The disabled bay has
massive yellow lines so he must have known where he was parking. It=92s
probably just laziness.=94

The airport does not plan to take action against the Dutch star.

A spokesman said: =93It looks like a mistake on his part.=94

Van Persie and his agent could not be reached for comment.

ENGLAND skipper John Terry sparked fury by leaving his flash motor in a
disabled parking bay =97 while he enjoyed a long lunch.

Terry, on a whopping =A3100,000 a week with Chelsea, blocked the spot for
about two hours as he ate with his family.

And he seemed little bothered when returning to find a =A360 fine on the
windscreen of his black Bentley.

The star swept away, leaving locals furious at his =93arrogance=94.

Terry, 27, jammed the high street bay while lunching at Pizza Express in
Esher, Surrey.

Yards away is a 50p-an-hour public car park.

One shopper raged: =93He arrived at around 12.30 and went to Pizza
Express.

"I think it is just arrogance.

"Anyone with any sense of morals would say, =91It is convenient to park
there, but someone could clearly use it more than me.=92=94

He added: =93If you have money, you can buy your way out of doing wrong.=94

Surrey councillor Jimmy Cartwright branded Terry=92s behaviour
=93disgraceful=94.

He went on: =93He is showing a blatant disregard for the law and for
disabled people.=94

Terry =97 with wife Toni and one-year-old twins Georgie and Summer =97
signed autographs before driving away last Friday.

Last night an aide said Terry was sorry and pledged not to do it again.

Harry
