Subject:Re: [Hsqldb-user] Re g:Optimizing and increasing my performance in
 hsqldb

Hi Fred,
That was really awesome. I increased NIO size and the performance was so
good . 
But still joins are taking lot of time. Can you suggest me to get better
performance on joins.
I put indexes on the join keys on both the tables but still the join query
on sqltool is taking minutes to give the output which is very slow for me.

thanks in advance,
-sandeep.

Got visibility?
Most devs has no idea what their production app looks like.
Find out how fast your code is with AppDynamics Lite.
