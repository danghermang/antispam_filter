Subject:Re: [address-policy-wg] [Ticket#2012110601002595] Status of /24 PI
 IPv4 from last /8
Hello there people!
I've read this list for quite a long time now and finally achieved the
point when i would like to ask: how do we start voting process, or,
say, create a new policy proposal regarding the prohibition of PI/PA
space exchange between operators?
I strongly agree with my colleagues from LeaderTelecom: the transfers
definitely will occur, no matter whether RIPE NCC wants them to or
not, but if we create a policy that allows such transfers in a "legal"
(from RIPE's perspective) way, than those at least will become
organized. If by now policy does not change - i'm very much sure that
lots of origin ASNs will travel to new geographic locations :)
