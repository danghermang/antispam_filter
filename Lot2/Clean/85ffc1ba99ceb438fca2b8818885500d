W3C Invites Implementations of Content Security Policy 1.0

   15 November 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9633

   The Web Application Security Working Group invites
   implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of "Content
   Security Policy 1.0." This document defines a policy language
   used to declare a set of content restrictions for a web
   resource, and a mechanism for transmitting the policy from a
   server to a client where the policy is enforced. Learn more
   about the Security Activity.

CSS Writing Modes Module Level 3, CSS Masking Drafts Published

   15 November 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9632

   The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group has published a
   Working Draft of "CSS Writing Modes Module Level 3." CSS
   Writing Modes Level 3 defines CSS support for various
   international writing modes, such as left-to-right (e.g. Latin
   or Indic), right-to-left (e.g. Hebrew or Arabic), bidirectional
   (e.g. mixed Latin and Arabic) and vertical (e.g. Asian
   scripts).

   The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group and the SVG
   Working Group have published the First Public Working Draft of
   "CSS Masking." CSS Masking provides two means for partially or
   fully hiding portions of visual elements: masking and clipping.
   Masking describes how to use another graphical element or image
   as a luminance or alpha mask. Typically, rendering an element
   via CSS or SVG can conceptually described as if the element,
   including its children, are drawn into a buffer and then that
   buffer is composited into the element's parent. Luminance and
   alpha masks influence the transparency of this buffer before
   the compositing stage. Clipping describes the visible region of
   visual elements. The region can be described by using certain
   SVG graphics elements or basic shapes. Anything outside of this
   region is not rendered.

       learned from Do Not Track standardization and real-world
       implementations? Furthermore, undoubtedly support for
       privacy on the Web platform cannot end with Do Not Track:
       what should we look at next and beyond DNT?

       Today’s eBook market is dynamic, fast-changing and strong.
       eBooks compete with printed versions, and there is a wide
       choice of hardware and software available for eBook

       technical challenges in this market, some of which could be
       reduced or removed by standardization.
