Subject:Re: [Dixielandjazz] RADIO OKOM substitutes
Hello,

Another online music resource is WAMU's Hot Jazz Saturday Night:

http://wamu.org/programs/hot_jazz_saturday_night

Live Saturday 8-11 EST, or see the link on the page for last Saturday's
archived show.

I'll miss Radio OKOM. Particularly some of the Smith Street band live
recordings, which include audience banter I can only aspire to....
