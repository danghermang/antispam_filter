Subject:Re: [EVDL] Elcon PFC 1500 Died
Sorry to hear about your Elcon failure. Don't spend any money to fix it, its
way too small anyway. The standard now is at least 6kw for charging
preferably using the J1772. Anything less is a waist of time and money.
Don't give up on Elcon, I use a Elcon 6kw and most others I know use at
least a 5kw. You can say you don't need it, but am really saying you don't
want to spend the money. Upgrade.
