Subject:[CT Birds] LPP Golden Eagle
from Dana Campbell:
10/26 - New Haven - Lighthouse Point Park Hawkwatch -~ Juvenile Golden Eafle.  The HAMANA bird came to visit on  weak SSW wind.  Soon followed by a kettle of 15 Turkey Vultures for nice contrast.  I was just thinking about how bored I was.......  Never say die.
