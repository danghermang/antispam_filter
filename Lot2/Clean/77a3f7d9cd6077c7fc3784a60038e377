All good points, which leads me to wonder why there isn't a system that
offers both options.  Have a narrow band in the pedal travel that applies
no power and no regen.  Or maybe throttle release gives you coast, and
throttle back (press with heel) gives you variable regen.  Seems pretty
useful and simple, but no one's done it to my knowledge.
