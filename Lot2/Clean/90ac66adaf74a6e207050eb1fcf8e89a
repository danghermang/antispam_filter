I can't agree with you more. Here in AZ the summer heat is a real battery
killer as now experienced by some Leaf owners. I have a 2000 Insight Hybrid
and the NIMH battery pack throws a 'bad' battery pack code every day when it
is hot. I recharge it, rebalancing the individual cells by slow charging at
350mA (the BMS that Honda has cannot do this). Now that is it cooler, 80's
during the day, it takes 4 or 5 days before the pack throws the same 'bad'
battery pack code.

I've just gotten a new battery pack, made up of new, unused cells and am
going to install it today. I keep on thinking about an active cooling
system. The present system is just a fan that comes on (at 100 deg) to suck
air from the passenger compartment into and thru the battery pack. So the
'cooling', or 'heating' is the same temperature as the passenger
compartment. I've made some modifications, but not enough.

I envision something that is based on a Peltier system - does anyone know of
a module that can be inserted in an air stream that will cool the air enough
(delta T?) to cool/keep cool the pack?
