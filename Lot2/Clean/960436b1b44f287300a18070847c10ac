> Hi everyone. We've just returned from a cruise out to Fiji and Vanuatu. The cruise was mainly a holiday but we did keep our eyes open for new birds. While in Port Vila, Vanuatu, we took a taxi out to the Cascade Waterfalls about 10 km outside of the town. This site would be considered as lowland. There, in the carpark, high in a tree, we saw a green pigeon or dove that I so far have been unable to identify, although it reminded me of doves seen in Kalimantan. It was about the size of a feral rock pigeon; had a pale yellow head, neck and vent area (possibly female??) while the rest was a pale green with some possible blue/green on the chest & shoulders. The main identifying feature were the 5 or 6 pale yellow or cream circular dots on the outer wings. These dots were of irregular size. Any ideas???
