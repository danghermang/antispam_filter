Luckily I've never been in the position to make big mistakes :)  I think 
the stupidest thing I've done (just *after* starting my job in ISP Tech 
Support) was taking a call from a friend at home and we started 
chatting.  He mentioned a website of interest so I opened my browser to 
have a look at it.  On dialup.  Cue screech on phone line and a laugh 
from him with 'You just tried to connect to it didn't you?' and an 
embarrassed 'Uhh.. no?' from me.

Mind you one howler our business hostmaster did was change the IP 
address of the main mail server - the one that hosted all our business 
customers mail.  He told me in the car on the way to work, my immediate 
reaction being 'You pillock!' and he said the first alarm bell rang when 
they had the first of many calls from a customer saying they couldn't 
connect to their mail server and as the DNS servers refreshed over the 
next day it just got worse.

He didn't do that twice either :)
