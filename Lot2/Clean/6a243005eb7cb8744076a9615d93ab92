It would only allow them to transfer /28s if their target use was a valid q=
ualified use under 4.10. As such, I think I'm OK with that.

If people object to that, then I would suggest the following:

"Notwithstanding section 4.10, Current ARIN minimum allocation or assignmen=
t policy as defined in section 4 or section 6=85"
