Subject:Re: [Chelsea] suarez no friends
You're right - he may be a cheating c*nt, but he has at least one good point.

I wonder how outraged people would have been if, instead of a rather sickly expression of concern, he'd tweeted about the match without showing any concern at all

Another thing about him was that he stayed around JT while he was being treated showing, what I thought was, genuine concern. Did the right thing there as the collision was pure accident.
