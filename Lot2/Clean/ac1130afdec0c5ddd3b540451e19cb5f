Subject:Re: [EVDL] DC motors
Willie,

The switch will not last on DC because it will be made to handle AC
which is easier to break because of the alternating nature of the
current.

Most likely you have a universal motor in the chainsaw that will run on
AC or DC. An electromagnetic field coil is used that has its polarity
reversed along with the armature coil when the AC source reverses,
keeping the attraction between the two coils in the same direction.

These motors are not intended to run on DC, but they do.

You will need to change out the switch to something that will break your
DC voltage and last.

Alan

I just bought an electric chainsaw and it occurred to me that I might be
able to run it off my 120-156vdc packs.  Is that likely?

Label on the chainsaw says "120v 60hz 14.5 amp".
