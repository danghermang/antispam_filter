Subject:[meteorite-list] Classification for Novato (name pending approval)
Greetings All,

It is my distinct pleasure to have the honor of passing along the following=
 characterization of the "Novato" meteorite.  Here is the message that I re=
ceived from Dr. Alan Rubin:  =


I just finished analyzing the Novato "N01" stone:

It is an L6 breccia.  W0  S4
olivine Fa 24.1=B10.4 (n=3D21)
Low-Ca pyx Fs20.7=B10.5  Wo1.5=B10.2 (n=3D22)
Ca-pyx Fs8.0=B10.7 Wo44.7=B10.8 (n=3D5)
The chromite grains are somewhat richer in Al2O3 (6.4 wt.%) and MgO (3.4 wt=
.%) than unshocked OC chromite, but are more characteristic of shocked and =
shock-melted chromite grains.
Most of the metallic Fe-Ni is taenite with 77.7=B15.0 wt.% Fe, 21.4=B15.4 w=
t.% Ni and 0.51=B10.18 wt.% Co (n=3D18).  Only one kamacite grain was ident=
ified (7.2 wt.% Ni and 1.1 wt.% Co). =

The Co content of this single grain is intermediate between the ranges for =
L (0.70-0.95 wt.% Co) and LL (1.42-37.0 wt.% Co) chondrites, but is closer =
to L.

Plagioclase: Ab86.0=B10.6 Or7.0=B10.4 (n=3D14) is richer in alkalis than ty=
pical OC plagioclase, and probably reflects shock melting.

Troilite is essentially pure FeS; it contains no detectable Cr, Co or Ni.

And as I said before:

Silicates have weak mosaic extinction.  Plagioclase grains range from 50-20=
0 =B5m.  There are lots of troilite veins going through large portions of t=
he rock (silicate darkening).  Chromite grains are fractured; many have tro=
ilite veins transecting them.  There are a few chromite-plagioclase assembl=
ages.  =

I found one 12x20-=B5m-size grain of metallic Cu.  =

Some of the troilite grains are polycrystalline.  =

There are some patches where plagioclase has been melted and mobilized.  Th=
ere is localized melting around some of the metal and sulfide grains.  Ther=
e are a few silicate shock melt veins replete with small metal and sulfide =
blebs.  There are some chondritic clasts with far fewer veins that have mod=
erately large, highly recrystallized barred olivine and porphyritic olivine=
-pyroxene chondrules that are well integrated into the matrix.  These chond=
ritic clasts are much lighter-colored in transmitted light than the matrix =
of the rock.

Please pass this info along to all interested parties.

End of message from Dr. Rubin.

With best regards,
Bob V.
