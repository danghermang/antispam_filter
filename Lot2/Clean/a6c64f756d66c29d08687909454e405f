Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] RE: Seeburg 1950s DiNoc Cabinet Finish
	Restorations Vol 111, no 19
As I said in an earlier post, I distinctly remember the original roll of
Di-Noc I purchased in 1981/2 to restore a Wurlitzer 1100 was a thin veneer
so if Di-Noc came in other forms later on that could be the case, but I
know that mine came in a roll and was a very thin veneer. Of course in the
Wurlitzer factory they applied it much faster on the cabinet as they were
equippped to do that but when you are doing one machine at a time in later
years it is a different animal entirely. I've owned my 1100 since 1982 and
it looks as perfect as it did 30 years ago. The cabinet itself is a
beautiful walnut veneer and the door frame, which we saw stripped down to
its bare essentials was solid steel (I think aluminum) to prevent warpage
-- not wood. All in all, It was a quality product that still holds up
today...
