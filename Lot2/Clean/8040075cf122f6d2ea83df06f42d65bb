Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Thieft of archives
John, why do you think we have a login ? -- probably because it's a 
private list, don't you think? Trying to divert the topic in question 
to some personal debate is not welcome. Are you the person we seek? We 
will find out who is involved as we have in other occasions. We're in 
no mood to argue and you can read why further below.

And, don't start telling us what other members may think so there is 
no "us." Not all think like you.

We don't won't to debate this so it's best you help not hinder. If you 
just want to argue, you may unsubscribe (or be removed) because 
everything on this site is under copyright starting with the very 
front page. Moreover, we have mentioned the copyright on this list 
before. It's in the stolen archives.

Lucky for the members, we obfuscate the email addresses in 
anticipation of such harvesters.

Thanks to Mike Waters who just sent in a very helpful lead. Now READ 
it in the topic "Email Spies":

We're simply sick and tired tired of having to spend time and money to 
chase down thieves. On the cebik site alone, we have located and shut 
down eight or more sites. Two just within the past month including one 
on the other side of the globe. No matter who or where they are, we 
can find them and prosecute if needed.

Now  either help or butt out of our biz or unsubscribe..... we're 
seeking help well within our rights -- not arguments.

Rosie,

With all due respect for your best intentions, are you claiming that
messages posted to this list become the property of antenneX? That
seems to be the case since you can't prosecute anyone for theft (or
even "Thieft") of something that isn't yours.

The lengthy "Welcome" message I received when I subscribed gave no
indication that antenneX would own my posts and I suspect that other
members would be surprised and perhaps offended by this notion. Please
clarify this for us.

Thanks,

John, KU4AF
