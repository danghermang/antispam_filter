Subject:[CT Birds] WHITE-EYED VIREO - Westport
From Frank Mantlik, with Sunrise Birding group-
11/13 Westport, Sherwood Is. State Park- highlights: apparent WHITE-EYED VIREO, White-crowned Sparrow, 2 Northern Gannets. We had brief views of the probable Vireo, which was at the northwest side of the park, among the vine-covered Arbor Vitae trees near the Boating Office sign and maintenance buildings. We couldn't relocate this very late individual.
