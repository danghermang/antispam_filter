Subject:Re: [Koha] Improving the advanced search form
Hello
We too want to turn off or limit languages to ones that are actually =

available in our catalog.
It's not easy but possible : you need to modify 3 tables in the MySQL =

database :
- language_descriptions
- language_rfc4646_to_iso639
- language_subtag_registry

We are going to do this in my library (not done yet...).
