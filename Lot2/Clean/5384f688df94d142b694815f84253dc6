Subject:[Jukebox-list] Rock-Ola 507 Wallbox
I'm shortly taking delivery of a Rock-Ola 507 wallbox  that looks in good 
condition and I'm assured it was working when taken from the host machine, 
(you have to take these things on trust don't you?)
Although I've a couple or Rock-Ola jukes, I am hoping to convert this wall 
box to play mp3 files via a kit and an itunes nano.
Has anyone done this successfully?

I've made enquires about a kit, but my first job is to get a power supply 
for the mechanics of the box, to get it working.

I presume it's 25 volt AC 2amp,  as I also have a 500/504 wallbox and manual 
which gives these values.

Firstly, is this the right voltage and does anyone know where I can get a 
transformer for one of these?
It'll have to be 230/240 volt imput as I'm in the UK.

Regards,

Bob.
