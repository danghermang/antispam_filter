Subject:[Hsqldb-user] Comparing strings with null values
I am currently upgrading from 1.7 to 2.2
Possibly the biggest issue I am faced with is converting conditional
statements in the where clause from something like:

WHERE customer.name <> 'foo'

to

WHERE IFNULL(customer.name, '') <> 'foo'

It seems that if customer.name is NULL the first statement will no
longer return true.
Is there some kind of compatibility setting I can use to all this type
of comparison or do I need to manually eyeball every piece of SQL to
adjust each query individually?
