Has anyone mentioned Esther Hautzig's 'The Endless Steppe',  which is about exiles in Siberia, and includes a lot about hunger and deprivation.

The hero of Anne Holm's 'I Am David' suffers from both literal and emotional hunger.

Elizabeth Laird's 'The Coldest Winter' deals with people living in 19th century Ireland at a time of famine.

Just thought of a couple more:

The Arrival by Shaun Tan could spark some interesting conversation about immigration--hungering for a better life, missing the loved ones left behind, etc.

My Name is Sally Little Song by Brenda Woods features a slave family that finds out that two of the children are going to be sold farther south and they escape to try to join up with Native Americans.  Freedom themes, mom dies...


Also, the hunger for freedom is very eloquently voiced in Virginia Hamilton's version of the short story "The People Could Fly" in her book by the same name.

Cool theme!
