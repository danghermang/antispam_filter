Subject:Re: [Chelsea] DI MATTEO SURPRISED BY JAPAN DECISION [TOCFCWS]
Some interesting observations about the FIFA Club World Cup (CWC). New
Zealand have a club team in the A-League which if they are good enough
can compete in the Asian Champions League (ACL) as the A-League is
part of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The winner of the ACL
gets entry to the CWC. New Zealand also have their own local league,
the "ASB Premiership", whereby the top team at the end of the regular
season and the winner of the finals series are both invited to compete
in the Oceania Football Confederation's Champions League (known as the
O-League). The winner of the O-League also gets entry to the CWC. This
means it's possible for NZ to have two clubs in the CWC via two
different confederations.

The host nation of the CWC also get to nominate a club team to
compete. Which is why the winners of Japan=92s J-League also get a gig.
Now imagine if NZ were able to host the CWC...

Lastly, this year's CWC will mark the first time that goal-line
technology will be used in a FIFA sanctioned match.

Cheers,
Nelson
