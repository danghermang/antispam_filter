Subject:[Chelsea] Torres vs rooney
Watching the scum Utd yesterday and Saturday it was evident that once Rooney gave the ball out wide he dashed into the box and got his head to the ball and scored. Again for his second goal he was very much nearer the goal line than Torres. I think that Torres should be convinced he needs to head straight into the box ASAP. If he is offside then he will need to time his run better. He was unlucky with the 1 on 1 and he was no where really for the stud ge goal when he should have scored.
