Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Luiz another less than competent display.
It's not compulsory to move forward. If there's no-one available ahead
after he's run 30 yards (including straight past one of his
team-mates) it's not a good idea to attempt to run a further 50 yards
through half a dozen more players. Nor to pass to someone already
swamped by defenders. Presumably the rest of the team is somewhere.
The alternative is not just to hoof it. Hoofing it is for another
situation entirely, which may or may not be the best thing to do. You
can be as cultured as you like, but there's no substitute for that
kind of stupid.

Set pieces are pretty good. The opposition does tend to be a minimum
of ten yards away and not allowed to move until he's kicked it, so
it's the cherry on the cake. It's not the cake.

I'm as fed up of saying it as much as I'm sure you're fed up of
reading it, but a defender who gets 7 out of 10 things right is a
disaster unlikely to stay in a job. A forward who gets 7 out of 10
things /wrong/ is as near world class as you'll find anywhere. The
roles can't be compared because the demands and the risk\reward are
vastly different. To even raise that as a point is  misleading.
