Subject:[burners] I'm hanging in there, but I could use your help.
*[For those just joining us, this is a followup to a post titled "Personal
crisis", from earlier this month.]*

tl;dr: Ow, my life. Please call me, I'm sad. And please tell me who can
help fix my back and neck (using insurance).

I'll go from least to most important.

My car is pretty fucked up, from having been driven into. I was deemed Not
At Fault (At All) for the accident, since that's apparently what happens
when someone drives their goddamn truck into your stopped-at-a-light
vehicle. I will get a decent amount of money, given that my car was badly
damaged. It's a hassle and upsetting.

My back and neck are still stiff and painful from the car accident. I have
been unable to resume my exercise (and I am one of those people who goes to
the gym 5 days a week, who then goes out dancing on the weekends). I feel
geriatric. Normal activities like vacuuming or lifting a heavy bowl at the
dinner table feel dangerous to attempt. I have not yet identified an
appropriate physical therapist.* Please send recommendations for physical
therapists (PT) and massage practitioners who take insurance. *And if you
want to come over and help me with things like, well, vacuuming, I wouldn't
turn you down.

My very ill family member is finally improving, but not yet out of the
woods. It went up and down, and there were several dreadful days where we
were not sure what was going to happen. This is one of the most agonizing
things I have ever been through. I have the support of my friends, but
there are moments, like this grey morning, where I feel alone.

Things have been extremely, extraordinarily difficult for weeks.
And I had a very painful experience last night.

SO. This would be an awesome weekend to *reach out to me*.

I want to hear from you, whether by email or chat. I want your phone calls.
I want company. But I have a hard time handling scheduling.* The best
method is to offer specific, concrete plan suggestions* to me ("Hey, Erika!
Want to go to the Fruity Blergs festival with me this afternoon at 3?" /
"Hey Erika! Want to hang around and watch some classic standup with me? I'm
free Sunday all day and Wednesday after 6.") That would be way more helpful
to me than general "I am there if you need me" emails, because I don't
really know what to do with those.

Also I would appreciate help navigating the recovery from injury, both with
regards to methods of rehabilitation, and the legal end of things, whether
I should consider a lawsuit.

That's really all. I just want more support right now. I sometimes have
trouble reaching out to individuals, even when they have already reached
out to me, so if you tried already, feel free to try me again. And if you
don't write, but you see me at a party or whatever, please feel free to
come up to me and offer a very gentle hug.

Hope all of you are having a better October than this.

Erika
