Subject:[Maps-l] Updates in OSM-Gadget
Hello,
there are some new features in OSM-Gadget:
*As additional layer we support the tiles from Opengeoserver.at.
This service combines satellite and aerial images from different =

sources[1]. Best image quality is available in parts of Austria and =

Bavaria. The primary aim of Opengeoserver is to be a mapping tool for =

OSM. Please respect that if have not the server power of Google maps, =

buts a beginning.
The images looks interesting together with the transparent tiles we are =

using for multilingual rendering and with our hillshading.

*For a longer time is also a public transport layer (=D6PNV-Karte) =

available.

*OSM-Gadget is running now Openlayers 2.12 in a minimized version, so it =

needs only 400kB instead of 1MB at the first time.

Greetings Tim alias Kolossos
