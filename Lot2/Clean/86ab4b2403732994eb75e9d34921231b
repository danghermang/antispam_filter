Assuming that this radiator is a monopole -- then for good performance, a 
half-wave vertical monopole needs to be driven against either a set of 
buried r-f ground radials with as low an r-f loss as possible/justifiable 
within ~1/2WL of the monopole, or a counterpoise of several elevated, 
symmetrically-arrayed, 1/4-wave resonant radials.

Such r-f loss resistances are in series with the r-f current that can flow 
along a monopole radiator itself, regardless of its physical/electrical 
height, and will directly affect the radiation efficiency of that antenna 
system.

True.  For one real-world example, WLS in Chicago (50 kW omni, 24/7 on 890 
kHz) uses a vertical monopole of about 1/2-wavelength -- and it is driven 
against  _240_  x 1/2-WL buried radials.

WLS would not have installed such an expensive r-f ground reference if it 
wasn't needed to maximize the fields radiated by their ~1/2-WL monopole.
