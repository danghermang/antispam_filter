Jimmy,

At the risk of getting off on a tangent, the only reason we ended up
with 2 x /21 vs. 1 x /20 is that we have been extremely stingy with IP
space where our competitors have been handing them out like candy. At
one point we were charging $30/mo, per IP in order to conserve space.
We were able to survive on a single /21 for 4 years as a result. One
of our competitors who does not follow the same best practices has an
aggregate /16 or so.

The lesson i've learned is that wasteful companies receive
preferential treatment under current policies.
