Subject:[Jukebox-list] New member seeking help for about a Wurlitzer 1250
	finish
Hi: 

I just found and suscribed to the list. I am in the process of restoring a Wurlitzer 1250 and have a few questions with which I
haven't been able to find help on a couple of forums, so I am hoping there will be somebody with the knowledge of what I need here.

First, a little about myself: I live in Mexico and collect and restore a few old things. My main hobby is cars, but I do have also
fountain pens, and just a few phones, cameras, radios and 5 jukeboxes: 1937 Rock-Ola Imperial, 1950 Wurlitzer 1250, 1951 Wurlitzer
1450, 1952 Wurlitzer 1500 and 1953 Wurlitzer 1550. 

Only the 1450 and Rock-Ola are good looking and at my home and so far I have only restored the 1450, and plays well. I still have
the other 3 to restore. Basically good original but very abandoned juke boxes. I like to restore myself (with professional help
sometimes). I am a purist and like to restore things to back to how they were done originally.

Question now is how should I finish the 1250? I have seen several pics which seem to contradict one another in a few things, so the
details I need to know are:

1. Chrome and nickel. In my case, which seems to have been an unrestored 1250, the side pillars and up to the sides of the button
panel, my jukebox shows chrome (shines blue), while the button panel itself, speaker mouldings and upper moulding (hinge for the
cover) show nickel plating (shines yellowish). Is this normal to have both chrome and nickel? Should I plan to restore it the same
way?

2. I have seen pics of some 1250 with the sides of the button panel (same part as top of the chorme pilasters) painted in brown
color, and they appear that way in the literature and old pics, but in my case (and another one I found on the net) these were done
in chrome. It is pretty clear that in my case this parts have factory chrome. Were they done both ways? Perhaps a deluxe option? 

3. The base of the jukebox, or the bottom part, hiding the wheels and holding the bottom stainless moudling, in the factory
literature and some original pics, seems to have been painted black. In some others it seems to be the same wood color. Can anybody
tell me how it is supposed to be? 

Thanks for any help,
Victor
