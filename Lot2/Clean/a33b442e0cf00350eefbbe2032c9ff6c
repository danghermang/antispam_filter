Subject:Re: [burners] Creatures of The Night this Friday!
 -1 for forums.  (also, creating one place where you MUST go for your burner ness, generally fails, as a community tool... and actually serves to splinter community and create more moderation)

also, events = Yes please.  though I'd prefer for "this is zebbler" to "bassnectar is playing" but I won't object to any.  Radical inclusion of all messages.  :-)

But you guys promote for profit (but local) businesses all the time.

CBC, mom and pops, etc.

Mind you, CEMI is a non-profit, but the event mentioned is for profit.
However, it helps PAY ARTISTS, which sounds to me like it should be more
important then pretending you can erase the concept of currency exchange.
Decommodification is a beautiful concept, and I think there are ways and
ideas to implement it.  One of those ways includes helping to eliminate the
concept of 'starving artist' and allow these creative folks some ground to
stand on.  Who knows what they would be capable of if they were worried
about community and not how they were going to eat next week.

Can we just tag it?  Like, instead of [OT] we add [EVENT] or [CLASS]?

Oh, and +1 for forums (we're working on this :P )
