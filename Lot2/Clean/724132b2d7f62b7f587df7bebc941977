Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Pluvialis ID Required in PNG
Thank you to all those that replied with an ID and other information. My
apologies that I messed up the original photo link, the correct link as
some pointed out is:

should be accessible to anyone - even those on face book. I did a
short
blog post with the same pictures at:

If anyone finds themselves in Port Moresby I'd be happy to go birding with
you.

Thanks,
