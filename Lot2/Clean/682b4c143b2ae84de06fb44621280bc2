Subject:[CT Birds] EVENING GROSBEAKS are near
I, like so many others, are excited that EVENING GROSBEAKS are being seen this 
fall. 

I so remember when they were a common sighting in the State of CT during the 
winter.
I have a friend who lives in lower New Hampshire near Mt Manadnock that has 
these
birds at her feeder yearly, and she says they regularly nest in the area as 
well. She lives
about 70 miles north of Hartford CT and commutes to Hartford to work.
If she can do this trip, I can't see why these Grosbeaks can't as well. So they 
are really
closer to us to the north than we think.

Food for thought...Paul Carrier
