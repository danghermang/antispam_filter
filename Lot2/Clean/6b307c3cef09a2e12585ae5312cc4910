Harald

Thanks for the feedback.

Regarding the IXP discussion, based on Jerome Durand's I-D, it appears that=
 IXP prefix are sometimes longer than /48 and some people drop such prefixe=
s received over BGP. And, it there is no route the IXP prefix, then packets=
 generated with the IXP prefix as source address will be dropped by uRPF ch=
ecks. Using LLA in IXP will prevent any IXP customer to use the IXP prefix =
as a source address ;-)=20

Nothing magic but could be useful
