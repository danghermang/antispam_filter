Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Unusual markings inside baby cuckoo's mouth.
Well I just wanted to note my agreement with Graeme about Pheasant Coucal chicks (they are diabolically ugly as nestlings, so ugly to be almost appealing in a converse kind of way). We once reared some chicks from a few days old and we all agreed about their ugliness. Only a  mother would love them. However, later, at fledging, they became very attractive to our human eyes. "Cal" was the unimaginative name we used for one survivor who loved grasshoppers, mince and caterpillars. Luckily our kids collected the bush food. 

Just the last few days I have been surrounded by Pheasant Coucals calling around our house and I rather imagine Cal is one of them.

On the mouth markings, I have seen many different ones amongst the finches but also wonder how widespread this is amongst other groups. The function seems obvious in most cases.
