Are you sure?  After all, you anonymize these objects in the database
dumps, citing data protection concerns:

The latter is from the ripe.db.role.gz file.  (Curiously, the
"changed:" lines are left intact in the dump.)

I worry that most LIRs put quite a bit of effort into updating the
contact information, and then RIPE NCC decides to hide it because it's
considered personal data, like all the other contact information
currently in the database.
