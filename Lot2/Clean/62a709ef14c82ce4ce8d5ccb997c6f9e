Factoring primes. Hash cracking. Pre-computing rainbow tables. Etc.
Let's face it, outside of academia, that's what we want massive
parallelism for.

Except a Super Micro chassis with a bunch of PCIe v3 GPGPUs is the way
forward.

Even purely for fun, I'm not sure I see the point of bothering to
cluster Pis together. Weak CPU, slow interconnect, glacial performance,
buggy distributions... If you want to play with SMP stuff, surely your
main PC or even laptop has more than one core these days?

PS: Gordon's old job sounds really, really cool. Did you actually get to
work with Transputers? So envious.
