Subject:Re: [Chelsea] morning papers
Journalists gloating again -What a disaster - we are just about to go out
of the CL in the group stages - what has the club done to generate such
schadenfreude?

We win at home in two weeks time and we'll be level on points with the
'run-away leaders', draw in Turin (which doesn't seem too difficult a task
looking at the way Juve have played this season) and win at home against
Nordsjaellend and we'll top the group with 14 points. Draw at home with
Shaktar but achieve the draw/win against the others and we'll finish
second. Doesn't seem too difficult.
