I believe that would be a process known as "silvering" or "mirroring".=A0 Y=
ou can see a demo here=A0 http://angelgilding.com/PumpSpraySilverVideo.html

I had some M100C glass tubes made using this process by someone who made up=
 laboratory equipment - that is, he took some plain glass tubes of the corr=
ect size and applied the silvering internally.=A0 They turned out great.

Norman.

Hi All,
Does anyone know of a process to re-do the "reversed-chrome" on plastic par=
ts, such as used on some ( model R, V) Seeburg mech covers, and the "select=
ion now playing indicator" used in the AY-DS models?
TIA, Ron Rich=20
