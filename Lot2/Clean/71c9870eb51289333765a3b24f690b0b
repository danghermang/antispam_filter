Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Capture Area
For an interesting treatment of loops near small ferrite-front-end radios,
the late Mike Villard (Stanford) did a lot of work in this area.  He was
trying to design loops that Eastern European listeners could use to
selectively accept their desired radio stations' signals, and reject jamming
signals produced by displeased governments.  The loops he used were
air-cored, and were tuned.  Orientation of the loop with respect to the
radio/ferrite coil orientation,  all with respect to the directions of the
desired and rejected signals made for complex user activities, but
satisfying result much of the time.

	Well, a tuned loop placed near an AM radio with the usual ferrite
loop inside greatly increases the sensitivity and selectivity of the AM
radio.  There are examples on the net.  
	I have noticed that the time shown by my GPS receiver usually
differs by a a second or few from my 60KHz clocks.  I don't know why that
is.

Colorado and we are at the very edge of the range at 60hz or thereabouts.
It is a decent watch, though, so I don't really mind, but I wonder if I
wound a larger loop and left the watch near it for awhile if that might
help.  Or maybe reception will get better as atmospheric noise declines with
the onset of winter.  Actually I haven't reset it for awhile and it seems to
be withing a second of my GPS so that might have happened already, or am I
being too optimistic?
