Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] 1/2-wave vertical really needs a
	groundplane?
I am still waiting for a explanation of the J antenna (commonly misscalled =

the JPole) where a 1/2 wave wire is end fed with a 1/4 wave transmission =

line shorted on the other end. The transmission line does not radiate (very =

much) so it is not a counter poise and does not interact with a "ground" so =

it is not radials.. Another antenna is the Ringo where the 1/2 wave wire is =

fed with a 3/4 turn about 1/4 wavelength long. I think the Station Master =

antenna so popular in two way communications is also of interest where you =

have a string of 1/2 coaxes connected alternatively and fed with a 1/4 wave =

coax.

All of these geometries do not require any radials but the station master =

does have three 1/8 wave radials at the feed end. Perhaps the end fed 1/2 =

wave needs this small addition to be matched as I don't see how it would =

remove common mode on the outside of the coax. None of the above antennas =

seem to have radiation from the feed line.
