Subject:[Jukebox-list] Seeburg Rex motor overheating?
I have a late 30's Seeburg Rex that I'm getting back into working condition after many years sitting unused. The mechanism has been cleaned and lubricated, and appears to be working well.

After about an hour of constant operation, however, the motor feels hot-not so hot that I can't keep my hand on it, but if it were any hotter it would be too hot to hold. The motor also smells hot at this point. I've turned the motor off at this point so I don't know how much hotter it would continue to get if left on.

I cannot detect any binding in the mechanism, there does not seem to be very much resistance when I turn the shaft by hand. 

I'm concerned that this heat may damage the insulation in the motor, leading to a short and failure. Does anyone rewind these motors (it is a 1/30 hp 110 V AC motor)? Would a lower voltage be better for this motor? It is labeled 110 V but line voltage is around 120 V? Or is it normal for these motors to get hot?

Thank you,
