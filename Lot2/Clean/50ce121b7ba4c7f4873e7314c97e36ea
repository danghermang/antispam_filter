Hi Braun As,

Join All-About-Microsoft's Mary Jo-Foley; Reg regular and ITwriting
author Tim Anderson; MVP and co-author of the Great Big Hyper-V
Survey Aidan Finn, representing Microsoft; and fellow Reg readers in a
Live Chat to talk about what's in Windows Server 2012 and why exactly
it's starting to turn the tide on market-leader VMware.

We'll be looking at why enterprises are likely to upgrade now rather
than later and working out where Windows Server 2012 fits into a
Redmond cloud story that also contains Windows Azure.

Is this a "software data centre" or a "cloud OS?"=20

Speak your Brains on Monday 5th November.
