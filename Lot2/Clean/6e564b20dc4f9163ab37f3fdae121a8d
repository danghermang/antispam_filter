Subject:[cooperation-wg] RIPE NCC Report on IGF 2012
Dear colleagues,=20

The seventh Internet Governance Forum took place in Baku, Azerbaijan =
from 6-9 November 2012, bringing together more than 1600 people from 128 =
countries. The RIPE NCC participated in the event, working with fellow =
Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and industry partners to develop the =
IGF program, organise workshops and contribute to discussions.=20

Reports and session transcripts have now been published on the IGF =
website for the three workshops that the RIPE NCC was involved in =
organising:

Workshop 99: Moving to IPv6: Challenges for Internet Governance =
(Organised by the Number Resource Organization (NRO))

(Organised by RIPE NCC, AFRINIC and the Arab IGF)

The RIPE NCC also contributed to workshops on Internet Exchange Point =
development (Workshop 159), Developing a National/Regional Framework of =
Principles for Internet Governance (Workshop 170), and two sessions =
discussing output from the Arab IGF.

The main plenary session on Managing Critical Internet Resources (CIRs) =
considered issues surrounding the ICANN new gTLD program, =
Intergovernmentalism (focusing on the ITU, WCIT and the International =
Telecommunications Regulations) and IPv4 markets. Each of these =
discussions built on work done in earlier workshops, with APNIC Chief =
Scientist Geoff Huston representing the RIR community perspective on the =
panels. A transcript of this session is available at:=20

Looking ahead, APNIC Director General Paul Wilson spoke to the Closing =
Ceremony, highlighting the ongoing concerns regarding IGF funding and =
the importance of maintaining the IGF as part of a broader, =
multi-stakeholder, bottom-up system of Internet governance. There were =
also calls from many participants for the IGF to take a more active role =
in defining and facilitating "Enhanced Cooperation", a key concept in =
Internet governance processes since the World Summit on the Information =
Society (WSIS) in 2003.

The next IGF will be held in late 2013 in Indonesia. Paul Rendek will =
continue in his role as a member of the Multi-stakeholder Advisory Group =
(MAG), which will develop the themes and working methods for the event. =
There will also be opportunities for members of the general public to =
contribute feedback and ideas through Open Consultations, the first of =
which will take place at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris on 28 February =
2013.=20

We welcome any questions or comments regarding the RIPE NCC's =
participation in IGF 2013 on the RIPE Cooperation Working Group mailing =
list.

Best regards,
