It's not quite that bad, but I get your point. This is what happens if 
you try to convert a plain old heavy steel-bodied ICE car into an EV. 
It's too heavy, and can't carry enough batteries.

The Sunrise was built from the ground up as an EV. It is a normal 
4-passenger car, about the size of a Toyota Camry. In 1997 James Worden 
drove his Sunrise from Boston to NYC (273 miles) at freeway speeds in 
normal traffic on a single charge. That was with a 26 KWH nimh pack, so 
it was using about 100 wh/mile. Today's lithium cells outperform the 
nimh cells available back then, so a 500 mile range on a charge is not 
out of hand, and would only weigh 1500 lbs or so.
