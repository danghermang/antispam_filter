Subject:[OzFurry] <NSW> Kyell Golds coming to Sydney!
Hey Fuzzies, Kyell Gold , Author of Out Of Position, the Argaea series
and co-host of Unsheathed, is coming to Sydney in the last week of
November. He's expressed an interested in meeting fans and other cool
fuzzies...

I just wanted to see how many were interested in coming to a Coffee
meet/Dinner type thing! (possibly on the thursday?) Suggestions for
good places to go would be awesome too!

It's Probably easier if you prod me on Twitter, Facebook, IRC or here
(in order of preference) but yea.. Hopefully we can meet him and have
a cool time!
