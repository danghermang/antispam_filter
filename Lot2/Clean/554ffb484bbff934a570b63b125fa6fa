Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Microphone recommendations for 5000?
If you want to go all the way to the top, look at the specs on the Heil
Pro 40.  Adaptors are available for those who want "plug and play"
compatibility with their flex rigs.  I know, many will say that this mic
is an overkill.   For me, it was a good investment since I wanted
broadcast quality, durability and bragging rights.  Available new on ebay
for about $275....then, there is always the cost of the adaptors and the
PTT devise (hand trigger or foot switch).  You will need an inexpensive
mic stand or a more expensive mic boom with or without a shock mount.  A
"Pop Filter" is available which actually works!  Very cool.
