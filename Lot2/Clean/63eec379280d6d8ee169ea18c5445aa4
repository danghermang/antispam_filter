Subject:Re: [EVDL] EVLN: Focus guessometer-overreaction,
 too-much info for noob-driver
I was thinking about the many, first time EV-driving writers' pieces I
have read. In the beginning of the 2010 era of another set of production
EVs, a new set of media writers also had to spread far and wide how much
a noob they were about what they write.

In this piece ...
Instead of proving a piece that was informative of what they had learned
at the end of the 5 days driving an EV, they gave us a simple to create
blog-type of experience which was less EV informative and more about
just another noob riding the learning curve roller-coaster, with only a
paragraph at the end summarizing, EVs are not as bad as they were
hopelessly prejudiced against they would be.

If we believe that last paragraph, a journalist would have wanted to,
not so much support EVs, but spend the majority of the piece showing how
to over come all the fears other noobs would have. Just turning in a
blog to their editor is lazy writing. Makes me think this is what they
did in High School and if they even have a journalism degree, what they
also did in College. Then again, maybe their editor directed them to
write an EV piece with lots of emotional upheaval of their EV
experience.


fyi - the ratio of conservative/against EV newswire pieces is still
high. I would have thought (or rather perhaps wanted) all that negative
EV hoopla would die down after the election. But no, it is still running
3 against EVs to 1 neutral to pro-EV pieces. As I have posted in the
past, I do not post those unless there is something useful in them. The
latest tirades state: bought-n-paid-for so-n-so report sez EVs are
polluters, EVs are not-worth-it, EV-insurance-will-be-the-death-of-you,
+.

The tirades change every week or so like a moving target (like the
whack-a-mole game at a cheesy-rodent arcade). Its like they are being
manufactured akin to a munitions plant to fight the war on EVs eating
into their petroleum profits.


But back to noobs learning EVs ...
What does an ice driver have to know about how much dino-juice is left
when they drive their own ice for the first time? (keeping in mind, many
ice-drivers keep their simplistic ice mindset way past what they learned
in High School driver's Ed.).

Perhaps noobs should have a noob mode that runs the EV in Eco mode while
dumb-ing down all the bells and whistles (we do not want to confuse the
noobs, like a deer frozen in the headlights). Perhaps the how-much-left
meter should be more dampened (does not show large swings of readings).
After-all the fuel sloshing in the tank does not show on an ice fuel
gauge (its more of an average reading). 

But like the 'check-engine' light, there should be one red-light like
that but it goes on when power is being used wastefully/more than
necessary (lead foot driving, heater/air-conditioning on, etc.). I am
not so worrying about the second idea, as many ice drivers go on driving
forever with their check-engine lights lit (they wait until the car is
broken to fix it). But if the red 'your-mpge reading is too low' light
is on, they can not complain of a lower range than rated (they were too
dumb to heed the red warning light)

By Automakers only making EVs have a too-informative display, they scare
the noobs away. We need to make it easier for the ice-primates to learn
to drive an EV, not scare them away. Later, after a week of driving
their EV, then they can graduate from noob-mode to normal-mode.
