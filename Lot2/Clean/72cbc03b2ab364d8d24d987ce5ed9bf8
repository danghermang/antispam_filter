Subject:[Birding-Aus] Pluvialis ID Required in PNG
Hi.

I live on the campus of Pacific Adventist University outside of Port
Moresby in PNG. Given that there are no birding lists for PNG, I hope
you'll forgive my email. I am hoping someone can help me with a the ID of
the Plovers (Pluvialis sp.) that are currently on campus. Are they
Pluvialis dominica or Pluvialis fulva? Or have I got it really wrong & they
are Pluvialis squatarola? I have uploaded photos:

appreciate any ID help.

Thanks,
