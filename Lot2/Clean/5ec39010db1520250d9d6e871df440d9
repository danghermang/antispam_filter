I loved the books, which I definitely knew as the Bullerby books: The Six B=
ullerby Children; Cherry Time at Bullerby; Springtime at Bullerby. It makes=
 me feel quite nostalgic to think of them.

Dear Virginia,

There must have been many translations floating around. Ours (given to my
sister in 1964) was called Happy Times in Noisy Village. When I started
working in a bookstore in the late 70s, I could only find something called
The Children of Noisy Village, which wasn't exactly the same. I was
frustrated, because even as an adult, I wanted a copy of my own! I
learned recently from my sister (who's sharing her copy with the next
generation) that the title Happy Times in Noisy Village is once again
available. I never knew them as the Bullerby children.

I forgot about Kerstin being half a person. I remember the kids tying a
string to Olaf's tooth while he was asleep, and didn't one of the girls
bring a lamb to school?

Louise
