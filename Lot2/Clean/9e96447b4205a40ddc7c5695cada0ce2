Subject:[Koha] Catalog Error
I've trimmed down the cataloging process a lot for our very small library, but
when I try to add a book now I get the following error: 

Can't call method "fields" on an undefined value at
/usr/share/koha/lib/C4/Biblio.pm line 2438.

I'm a complete beginner with Linux, Koha, everything- I've struggled a lot to
get even this far, PLEASE HELP!

Thanks
