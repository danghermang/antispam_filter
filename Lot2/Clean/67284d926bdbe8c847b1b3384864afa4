I am puzzled by this - many plastic wrapped kitchen probes offer 0.1%  =

accuracy but are not suitable for automating but no-one seems to produce =

a suitable probe at anywhere near the price...
I think a hammer may be required.....
I want 0.1c resolution for OCD reasons as much as anything - though I =

will conduct beer mashing at that kind of accuracy out of interest...
