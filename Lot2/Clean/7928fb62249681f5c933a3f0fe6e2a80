Subject:Re: [Hsqldb-user] Why using coalesce on a foreign key,
 results in a non executable statement ?
What is your full SQL statement?

I tried an example and it works fine:
CREATE TABLE T (C VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY, CC VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE)
INSERT INTO T VALUES ('A', 'AB'), ('B', 'BA'), ('D', NULL), ('E', NULL)
SELECT * FROM T ORDER BY COALESCE(CC, 'AA')

BTW, HSQLDB's default behaviour for ordering nulls first or last is
configurable with two different URL properties. This may not apply to
your use, but when you want compatibility with one other database, you
can change the HSQLDB's default. Furthermore, HSQLDB supports explicit
NULLS FIRST and NULLS LAST in the ORDER BY clause.
