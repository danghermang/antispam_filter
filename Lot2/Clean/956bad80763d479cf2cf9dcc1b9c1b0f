Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Ratings v Spurs
Torres 6 and Cech 7? - that's harsh on Cech, he was much better than Torres :)

> Ratings:
> CECH, 7 -- Captain today and a calm, authoritative figure.
> IVANOVIC, 6 -- Had trouble with Defoe moving out to his wing and running at him. Got forward at every opportunity.
> CAHILL, 7 -- What a shot. He's done it too often to be a fluke. Solid outing but we miss JT's organization, particularly at free kicks.
> LUIZ, 6 -- Most egregious error was smashing through Dempsey to give away the free kick for their equalizer. Totally unnecessary and in my mind he was showing off. Same when he ostentatiously allowed a long ball bounce behind him and almost let in Defoe.
> COLE,6 -- Had trouble in the second half as Lennon ran at him, but rampaged forward effectively and made the defensive interventions when needed.
> MIKEL, 8 -- Ran the game in our half. All his qualities on display. He and Ramires allowed our terrific trio to express themselves.
> RAMIRES, 7 -- Can get up and down the field quicker than Frank and tackles better. Took a yellow card for the team when Lennon was in full cry.
> MATA, 9 -- Another superb display. Could have had four goals but more importantly was the chief creator.
> OSCAR, 8 -- Works exceptionally hard to close down the opposition and we know what skill he has. Doesn't do flash for the sake if it. Has adapted fast to the speed of the league.
> HAZARD, 7 -- Magnificent pass to send in Mata for the third. Was on the periphery until we went behind and then stepped up a gear. Needs to become more consistent over the 90 minutes.
> TORRES, 6 -- Was integral to our lightning quick moves and would have been an 8 if he could only finish. Still too hesitant when he gets his chances. Needs deeper discussions with Mata on how to finish.
