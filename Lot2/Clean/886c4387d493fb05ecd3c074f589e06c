Is there anything more dangerous than driving behind a birder?

Today, taking my shortcut to West Hartland from Goshen, I decided to look real 
good for a possible Shrike. 

Well driving East from Colebrook on Stillman Hill Rd, just at the corner of rt 
182A where a farm is, I spot
a white object on top of a bush - There, sits an adult NORTHERN SHRIKE!
It flew after a Bluebird! My dream came true!
