Subject:[Birding-Aus] Request for permission to use your photos
Hi Friends,

I am sending out a general appeal to give me your permission to use any bird
photos you have on the web on my website: http://worldbirdinfo.net

If you go the website, you can immediately see a statement of my aims, which
is,briefly,  to produce the maximum amount of information about every
species of bird in the world.

The site carries not a single advertisement, and not a single promotion. IN
other words it is totally non-profit. And If you agree, I will acknowledge
you in my acknowledgment page and also in every photo of yours that I use.
Many photographers have already kindly agreed to let me use their photos.
And If you are not a professional, that is, if you do not expect to raise
money from your photos, what difficulty would it cause you to have another
copy on the web, with full acknowledgment.

Thanks,

 

Dr John Penhallurick
