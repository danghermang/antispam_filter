Exclusive Juan Mata Interview

The accolades have come flooding in this season for Chelsea and Juan
Mata,  the Spanish matador at the heart of his club=92s new expansive
game.

But for the little schemer himself, what is more important than
anything is the courage Roberto Di Matteo=92s team have shown when the
going has got tough.

The Blues may have surrendered top spot for the first time this
season, although they are only a point behind Manchester United.

Yet even in their controversial league defeat against the Old Trafford
side, Di Matteo=92s team fought back from two down, just as they battled
to overturn a deficit at Spurs, against United in the Capital One Cup,
and beat Shakhtar Donetsk with their final touch in midweek.

And for Mata, even more important than the style of football that is
finally delivering Roman Abramovich=92s Chelsea vision, what really
matters is that extra element.

=93I think the football we=92re playing has taken the club, and my game,
to a different level,=94 said Mata, who aims to add to his seven goals
this season against Liverpool tomorrow.

=93We are playing the kind of football I have always loved to play, with
freedom up front, all of us trying to pass and create with quality.

=93But it=92s not enough to play in a good way. We have to win as well.
Our aim is to play good football. It has to be winning football. And
we can make it an amazing season.=94

Mata added: =93We always have belief in our dressing room and you see
that in the games against big rivals like Arsenal, Tottenham and
United.

=93United was a difficult game and so were both matches against
Shakhtar, but we are positive in our mind-set and that will be better
for us.

=93Of course, confidence comes from results. If you are winning, you
have that confidence, if you are losing you don=92t have it.

=93We have shown we have this strength, this power, to come back even in
the worst situations. When we were losing at Tottenham, for example,
we came back with =ADcharacter and with power.

=93So I think we have demonstrated we have those qualities. One of the
best things in this team is our belief in ourselves. We never give up.

=93Individually, we are always prepared, determined to do our best, each
one of us. If we want to beat Liverpool we have to be at this level.

=93When we are in a bad moment we want to show we are able to win, even
when, like against United, we are losing 2-0. We do not give up.=94

A huge part of that, feels Mata, comes from Di Matteo, whose quiet
dignity the former Valencia man picks out as a key attribute.

=93His speeches in team meetings are very clever,=94 revealed Mata. =93And
it=92s true that he knows how to go into each player. He talks with each
of us about our rivals and how important it is to win trophies for
this club.

=93With me, he always gave me =ADconfidence. Of course, when you are
playing well you don=92t need that.

=93But when you are in a bad moment, you do need it, and Robbie knows
when he has to say something and always gave that to me.

=93If you want to give 100 per cent, you have to feel that you are
important for the manager.=94

Mata=92s own intelligence shone out as he spoke with local school kids
at an event in support of Chelsea=92s Education Through Football
programme.

The 24-year-old=92s diminutive stature and inquisitive mind helped the
children identify with a player who admits his first thought each day
is to make his parents proud of him.

=93I=92m the way my father taught me to be,=94 he added. =93One of the best
things if you are a football player is to see the faces of the kids,
when they see you and are dreaming of being like you one day.

=93That=92s a big responsibility, to be a good image for those kids. A
football player is more than just a football player.=94
