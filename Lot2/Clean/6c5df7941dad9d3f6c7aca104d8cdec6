Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Typical FA
Actually the definition of "I don't give a monkeys" is an abbreviated
version of I don't give a monkey's toss".   I used it when I lived in
London without really knowing it's derivation.  It is apparently a
reference to the propensity of chimps  and another apes to masturbate
as when they were tossing off.   If Clattenburg used this idiom in this way
then it is entirely possible that John Obi misheard him not being familiar
with the idiom.  However, it would have been better to use the expression
"I don't give a shit" and the there would have not been any confusion.
