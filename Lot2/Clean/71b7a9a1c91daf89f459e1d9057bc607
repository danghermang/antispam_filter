Subject:[CT Birds] Rocky Hill Meadows
11/9 - I went searching for lapwings this morning with no luck but did see 2 juvenile brandt (all black in front, no white) sitting in one of the fields. Not something I've seen in the fields before. Also had about 30 horned larks, 15 American Pipits, Bald Eagle, Cooper's Hawk, Northern Harrier,, and a murder of crows.
