Yeah, exactly what Martijn said with the following extra provisos:

If your host doesn't use SFTP, they're idiots and you should try and
bend their arm into not being useless and lazy. FTP should have died a
long time ago but sadly lives on.

Martijn's threat assessment also glossed over one element, the unsecured
wifi bit - FTP passwords are cleartext, so if someone is on the same
network segment as you any basic traffic sniffing tool can pull your
password/user data straight out of the air, or off the wire. He's still
completely correct, but I'd go further - on ANY network you don't
completely trust or own yourself, you absolutely 100% must initiate a
secure connection over SSH or VPN to a known good system first, and
subsequently use that connection for all further traffic. Even a WPA2
secured wifi network in a reputable coffee shop or restaurant can't be
trusted. I've had a lot of fun with my tatty old laptop in coffee shops
and the like (purely research I should add, for mischief not evil!) and
you'd be horrified if you could see what 4 wifi interfaces with modded
injection-capable drivers are capable of in even vaguely skilled
hands... Let's not forget that quite recently, a simple Firefox plugin
(FireSheep) turned everyone briefly into a Starbucks hacker.

Treat all networks as hostile, you'll be a lot safer.

Cheers
