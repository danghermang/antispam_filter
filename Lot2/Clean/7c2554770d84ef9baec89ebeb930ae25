	but you're the smartest group I know. Possibly meaning of Waterloo
The Dutch (in the Netherlands) and the Flemish (in Belgium) also do not dub their t.v. shows or movies, so people are exposed to English from childhood.  So they're pretty good in English even before they study it in school.  I did not know that about babies though, that's fascinating.

I do know that my family (mono language English speaking daughter and Turkish as second language husband) can follow my conversations with my Flemish family pretty well.  I always thought it was because they know me so well, they can tell what I'm talking about, but also, yup, the languages can be very similar, so there are words that jump out at them

You all are just confirming my 'smartest group I know' perception.  :-)

Even before birth, the unborn baby becomes accustomed to the sound and stress patterns of their mother's speech, and when born, prefer listening to speech in their mother's language. Thus, English babies prefer to listen to English than to Japanese, etc. An exception is English vs Dutch. English babies will listen to Dutch just as readily as to English, and vice versa. This all seems to be based on the stress and prosody of the languages, not on actual words, which tiny babies don't yet recognize.
