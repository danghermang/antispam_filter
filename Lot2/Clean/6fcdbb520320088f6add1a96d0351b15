Subject:Re: [Dixielandjazz] Learn Dixieland Style for Trumpet
1) Go to YouTube, search for Louis Armstrong, turn your computer volume up
as high as your neighbours will allow, do your very best to keep up, but
don't worry about getting it 'right' for at least the first forty or fifty
years.

2) Listen, listen, listen to every player you can find.  When you find a
player, find out who they listen to and find their music too.

3) experiment and play, take something really simple that you already know,
Happy Birthday or When The Saints, and try to play it "Like Louis" or "Like
Bix" etc etc.  Start by adding just the articulation, the start and stop
and sustain of the notes, the playing with the time, worry about whole
improvisations later, just take what you know, take what you've heard, and
then go* jazz it up!*

4) if at all possible, find some other musicians to play with.  your
community may have a community band who might play at least a little
dixieland and probably marches and hymns that were the foundation of
dixieland, go join up and again, listen listen listen, learn the vocabulary
-- as a child, you didn't speak your mother tongue perfectly for a long
long time, but that didn't stop you from having something to say! :)
