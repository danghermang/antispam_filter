Many spam filters flag mail received with your own address as the "From"
as more likely to be spam, especially if they come from an off-network
address.  This is because spammers often forge the recipient's address
as the sender.  The curiosity factor of getting an email from yourself
that you didn't send causes people to be more likely to open it.

See if Gmail is putting your own posts into the junk folder.

You can also check the archives at any time to see if a post made it to
the list.
