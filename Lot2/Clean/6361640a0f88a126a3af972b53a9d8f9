Subject:[CT Birds] Golden Eagle over Mansfield
At 415pm, while taking a break from chores and watching the feeder in Mansfield, a juvenile Golden Eagle came out of the northeast and slowly glided to the southwest over the yard. It was losing altitude as it was gliding as though it was looking to put down for the evening.
