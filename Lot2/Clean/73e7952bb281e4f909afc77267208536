Subject:Re: [burners] Sandy prep & after-math
Happy to host people at our place, have a couple of nice big grills
and a gas stove. If the power goes out and it gets cold i'll be tying
the furnace into a battery UPS or borrowing a generator.

<sarcasm> And if the power *is* out, this email list is definitely the
best way to keep in touch</sarcasm>

Keep a phone charger in the car in case outages last a while (maybe those of us with cars could also coordinate  this resource with others).
