Subject:[Chelsea] A better way
The one consensus in the Clattenburg affair is that this is a mess that will end badly, probably for Chelsea. 
What could have been done differently? Here's my view in magnificent hindsight. 
No decision should have been made in the emotional post-match atmosphere when Chelsea had completely justified outrage at one of the most inept reffing performances in a top match. 
When the allegations surfaced in the dressing room, a Chelsea official, perhaps RDM, should have gone to see the ref and report the concerns. He should have told him the club would be holding their own inquiry before deciding to lay a complaint. 
The club should have kept silent publicly instead of releasing an explosive statement at 8 pm. RDM managed to get through his post-match press conference without mentioning it so it was possible to keep it from the media. 
Then they should have brought in the outside legal adviser, as they have done, to ascertain the strength of the case when post-match tempers had cooled. 
Only when the interviews were completed should they have made a decision to go public with filing a complaint or not  
That approach would have shown the players their complaints were being taken seriously, an important factor in today's climate, without dropping the race bomb on Clattenburg before due diligence had been done.
Some will argue that Chelsea haven't made a formal complaint to the FA, but that statement Sunday night ensured the shit hit the fan. We shot before we has established a legitimate target. 
If Chelsea decide not to file a complaint the club will be damaged. Not necessarily by the FA, unless the post-match ruckus in the ref's room provided an opening, but the club is trying to be a worldwide "brand" and PR types will tell you that this will damage the "brand". Most of us couldn't care, but rest assured that Roman probably does. 
The biggest casualty of all this will probably be Ron Gourley who has been involved in every misstep. 
It didn't have to be this way.
