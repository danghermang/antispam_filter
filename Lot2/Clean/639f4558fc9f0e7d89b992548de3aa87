Actually, I think the IPRAs are reading something in there that has
not been the intention by the WG (and it should be obvious from the 
discussions that it wasn't, because the case "what about a LIR that
has more than one /32?" was never discussed)

For non-native speakers (like me), the sentence above is perfectly fine 
to be interpreted as "... extensions of *any of these* allocations up
to a total of /29..." and not "... up to a total of a /29 across all 
IPv6 stock the LIR has".

We've been there with the "80% utilization" in IPv4, where the IPRA
interpretation was more strict than what the WG intended, and it seems
that this is another of these cases...


Anyway, to give clear guidance to the NCC, I think having Jan and Emilio
draft new text, have this be cross-checked by the NCC for interpretation
leeway, and then formally accept it via the PDP, is the right way forward.
