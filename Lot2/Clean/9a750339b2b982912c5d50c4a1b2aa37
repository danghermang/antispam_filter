Subject:Re: backport request
Please don't top post to the list.

Have any of you interested parties checked to see if the Wheezy version 
is installable on Squeeze in which case it wouldn't be a candidate for a 
backport?

As well as posting a request here another avenue to explore would be to 
contact the Debian maintainers of the package to see what they think, 
they might not routinely follow the list
