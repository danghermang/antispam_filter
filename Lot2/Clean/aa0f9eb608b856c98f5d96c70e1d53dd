Subject:TECH PANEL :: Are you really going to cloudify everything?
Hi Braun As,

Thank you for your continued support of The Reg Tech Panel. We have a
new Data Centre study that we're keen for your input on....

Given the chance, any IT vendor or service provider sales rep will
launch into their company's vision for the future.=20

If it's Salesforce.com or Google, that'll be a future in which you
wave goodbye to all of your servers, storage and networking kit.

If it's IBM, HP or Microsoft, their crystal ball says you will be
living in a world of hybrid clouds, mixing and matching internal
systems with external services to create a nirvana of choice and
flexibility.

But what do you think?

Get started right here...
