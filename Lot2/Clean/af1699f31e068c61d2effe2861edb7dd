Subject:Re: [EVDL] 3D modeling
Say we compare the battery setup with existing prismatic cells to the
now presented concept.

We know there is a lot of other stuff to support the active materials
in the cell. The plastic or steel casing. Foil assemblies with the
poles. More  space is used outside the cell also with inter connects,
BMS, fuses..

Adding the supporting structures to the enclosure, insulation.... and so on.

The amount of energy which you got in your conversion with all the
bits and pieces can be fitted in more smaller and lighter setup. Just
with 'hand made' cells.

If you require more power the active material and/or maechanics can be
chosen accordingly (smaller particles, thinner layers on the
foil/separator). More processed material usually costs more so it's up
to you what you see useful in the conversion.

So how this helps ? We'll leave more tolerance to ensure the right
fit. Think about 2" off from each dimension what you now have.

How to make it all right will be tricky. Has to be admitted. But the
trade-off could be a killer solution for converters. And we know there
are plenty new battery innovations in the labs that will be here now
or bit later.

This would not replace that much of existing cell sales but would
encourage more people to go for it. Privately or with conversion
business.
