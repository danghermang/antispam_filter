Team Utah grabs Mini Iron crown at little cluster compo
'Didya Hear the One About the Traveling Salesman?'

Until this year, the annual SC Student Cluster Competition focused
entirely on seeing how much work teams of university students could
wring out of 26 amps of juice. They can use any hardware/software
combination that will run the required apps; the only limitation is
that their configuration has to be shipping by the time of the show.
(For an overview, click here.)

Team Boilermaker: We hammer the code... not the booze
Student cluster compo kids signal possible move to hybrid HPC
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/28/sc12_cluster_competition_1/

We had a chat with Team Boilermaker on the last day of the SC12 Student
Cluster Competition. While the team did visit several of the vendor
parties the night before, they assert that they didn=E2=80=99t overindulge,=
 and
claim that the absence of some team members is due to meetings, not
hangovers. I think I buy that explanation; the Purdue teams take a
businesslike approach to their cluster battling.

NUDT on HPC battle: Total cluster supremacy - Who needs it?

High school kids fend off university challenge in student cluster
battle
For a little bit, at least...
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/27/sc12_cluster_competition_high_schoo=
lers_triumph/

The SC Student Cluster Competition (SCC) has seen university teams from
around the world vying to prove their cluster competence. But this year
has been marked by a number of firsts, including the first team
composed entirely of high school students. The Skyline High School
Eagles, located in Salt Lake City, entered the LittleFe Division of the
SCC and competed against three teams of older and more experienced
university students.

10,000 cities, 1 salesman, 6 nodes: It's LittleFe cluster CRUNCH TIME
Slippery Rock races against clock on final day of mini-cluster match

It was the last day of last week=E2=80=99s SC12 Student Cluster Competition,
and Pennsylvania university students Team Slippery Rock chatted to us
during the LittleFe battle. In this competition track, teams of
university students (plus a high school team) pushed their six-node
LittleFe mini-iron to the limit, attempting to find the best solution
to a 10,000-city Travelling Salesman* problem.

IBM recasts Power 775 Blue Waters super as big data muncher
GPFS storage servers don't need no stinkin' RAID controllers
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/23/ibm_gpfs_storage_server/

IBM has yanked the chain on the petaflopping 'Blue Waters'
supercomputer that it was going to install at the University of
Illinois this fall because it was too expensive to make at the budgeted
price.

But that doesn't mean the Power 775 server nodes that comprised IBM's
Blue Waters machine are not useful. Ditto for the PERCS software stack
that IBM created for the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
which partially funded the development of the machine. And so IBM is
gradually commercializing bits of the Blue Waters/PERCS machine,
starting with two storage servers tuned up specifically for big data
jobs.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/23/sc12_cluster_competition_venus/

We spent a few minutes on the last day of the SC12 Student Cluster
Competition (SCC) talking to Team Venus from the University of the
Pacific. This is not only their first year in the cluster competition,
but also the first time any of the students have done anything at all
HPC-related.

Under the mentorship of Oak Ridge National Lab and their hardware
sponsor Appro, the team gave it their best against much more
experienced competitors. They posted a respectable 2.33 Teraflop/s
LINPACK, which was good enough to put them into fourth place going into
the application round of the competition.

them they=E2=80=99re personable, friendly, and modest.

Very modest. Too modest. This is a team with a serious pedigree that=E2=80=

Team Venus disappears at computer sports smackdown
Cluster warriors: On your marks... 'Oh, no what was my password again?'

It was an exciting start to the real-time, non-stop 48-hour cluster
challenge, in which the teams of undergrads design and assemble a small
cluster and race to demonstrate the greatest sustained performance
across a series of applications.

Here=E2=80=99s a short video covering the beginning of the SC12 edition of =
the
Student Cluster Competition. It begins with co-chairs Doug Smith and Dr
Peter Molnar going over the logistics and rules (faculty advisors and
coaches - say goodbye to your team!) with the huge crowd of student
clusterers. Someone blows on what looks a lot like a ram's horn... and
the competition begins.

At last, I can reveal the final configurations of the systems the SC12
Student Cluster Competition (SCC) warriors brought to Salt Lake City
last week.

Here=E2=80=99s the gear they were running=E2=80=A6

First, kudos to all of the sponsors who generously provided so much
equipment at no cost to the cluster crown competitors. (There isn=E2=80=99t=
 a
real crown.) How about next year, all of you chip in and we get an
actual Cluster Crown that can go to the winning team? Maybe make it out
of old motherboards and chips and stuff?

SGI UV 2000 supers are Intel and Nvidia inside
Cheap flops flip bits in shared memory super and rackers
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/20/sgi_uv2000_rackable_accelerators/

Supercomputer makers used to stuffing processors and networks into
machines to build clusters or shared memory systems have to adapt their
machines to take advantage of various kinds of compute accelerators
that offers cheaper flops, and Silicon Graphics is no exception.

To that end, the company has reworked its high-end UV 2000 shared
memory supers and its Rackable hyperscale machines to borg the latest
Intel Xeon Phi and Nvidia Tesla coprocessors.

HP ProLiant SL270s Gen8 beast masters eight coprocessors
Nvidia Tesla, Intel Xeon Phi =E2=80=93 do my bidding math
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/19/hp_sl270s_gen8_server/

If you have decided that you want to build a grunting number-cruncher
that crams a hefty number of Tesla or Xeon Phi coprocessors into a
single chassis, then Hewlett-Packard wants to talk to you about the new
ProLiant SL270s Gen8 server.

The new SL270s Gen8 slides into the SL6500 "scalable system" modular
chassis, which makes it somewhere in between a rack and a blade server.
The SL6500 chassis comes in 2U and 4U variants, and is distinct from
the "Argos" SL4500 big data scalable systems that HP announced last
week, which are targeted at big data jobs that need to put lots of
storage on a node. With the SL6500s, the design is about packing as
many coprocessors in a chassis as possible to maximize floating point
computing per watt.

Chinese baby war-boffins bust 3Tflops, snatch student LINPACK crown
Aw jeez, the zero button on my calculator's broken
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/15/sc12_cluster_competition_linpack/

Salt Lake City is abuzz with news that China's NUDT team has once again
snared the LINPACK benchmark crown at a student cluster-building
competition. The team's record-breaking score of 3.014 TFLOPS topped
all other competitors and marked the first time a student cluster team
has broken through the 3 TFLOPS barrier.
