The US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory has
hooked up with HP, Intel, and partners to design a new hybrid
supercomputer and an energy-efficient data center wrapper for it that
will =E2=80=93 among other green gains =E2=80=93 use the exhaust heat from =
the
supercomputer to heat adjacent offices.

Intel teaches Xeon Phi x86 coprocessor snappy new tricks
The interconnect rings a bell
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/05/intel_xeon_phi_coprocessor/

It took fifteen years for Intel to shrink the computing power of the
teraflops-busting ASCI Red massively parallel Pentium II supercomputer
down to something that fits inside of a PCI-Express coprocessor card =E2=80=
=93
and the Xeon Phi coprocessor is only the first step in a long journey
with coprocessor sidekicks riding posse with CPUs in pursuit of
exascale computing.

Supercomputing takes a slight pause in Q2
Big systems drive HPC sales
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/04/idc_q2_2012_hpc_server_stats/

With all of the relatively cheap computing power available today, and
with the expanding focus from traditional supercomputers to clusters
that can run simulations or big data workloads, you'd think that the
HPC market would be growing like gangbusters. Not so.

That's the latest news from the box counters at IDC. But there's good
news, as well: in terms of sales, the HPC space helped prop up the rest
of the server racket in the second quarter of this year, and looks to
do even better in the second half.

Fujitsu to embiggen iron bigtime with Sparc64-X
So is this the Sparc M4 on Oracle's roadmaps?
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/04/fujitsu_sparc64_x_processor/

While Fujitsu has made some very respectable Sparc64 chips aimed at the
supercomputing market, it has been a long time since the Japanese chip
and server maker has put out a new Sparc64 processor that went into
general purpose servers.

That changes in a big way with the forthcoming Sparc64-X processor,
which will be used in both plain vanilla midrange and high-end servers
as well as in the PrimeHPC supercomputer clusters.

Mellanox rips covers off virt-SAN beast, claims Fibre Channel vanquish
Preparing a whuppening for VNX ass, one might think
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/31/mellanox_vsa/

InfiniBand vendor Mellanox has demonstrated a Fibre Channel-beating
virtual SAN appliance at VMworld, claiming it's six times faster than
FC SANs.

Virtual SAN appliances (VSAs) are becoming more serious. They started
out as SAN try-outs using server SW and the server's local disks to
produce a shared block-access storage area network (SAN) system without
the actual Fibre Channel or iSCSI Ethernet-connected storage arrays.
The server SW was basically the SAN array controller software.
