Subject:Re: [child_lit] OT,
	but you're the smartest group I know. Possibly meaning of Waterloo
Hi!

Yup, knew it was in Belgium.  :-)  That must be older Dutch, since currently 'nat' (naht) is wet or damp and water is water (thereby making Flemish/Dutch one of the EASIEST second languages for an American to learn)  :-)

Thanks!!

The second element is lo(o), an ancient word for "forest" or "clearing in a forest", coming from the Latin words lucus (forest) or lucum (clearing in a forest), cognate with the English place name suffix -ley or independent name Leigh. The early settlement was located on a marshy clearing in the Sonian Forest."
