Subject:[Flexradio] Upgrading XP to windows 7
My radio computer isn't working. Recently it has been running slow and I
decided to upgrade. I added a new video card to replace the on-board one
with sharesd memory and added more memory (2-8gig), and am now changing to a
64 bit version of W7 to use it. 

My first attempt to upgrade (just testing without changing I thought) hosed
up the boot into XP. I've got a temporary W& install (not validated until I
get the hardware finalised), and fortunately most data is intact (I've got a
backup of my DXlabs log from immediately before on  my linux server but not
much more as anofficial backup) but the disk seems to have errors which I
think was the cause of recent errors/slowness. I was not able to run the
windows 7 upgrade advisor as the computer locked up

I've taken the plunge and tomorrow a 128gig SSD and a 1Tb hard drive should
arrive early.

Any advice on how to set up would be appreciated. Any gotchas? Where to find
and where to copy configuration files.

I was using PSDR 2.4.4 , vspm, VAC4.12, DXlabs, FLdigi, JT65-HF and lots of
other goodies. I'm new to Win 7 but not computers.
