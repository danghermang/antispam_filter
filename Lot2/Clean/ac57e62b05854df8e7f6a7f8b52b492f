I don't think that's quite fair to say.  Most of the production EVs are 
indeed priced realistically - that is, in line with what it costs to build 
them in very small numbers with limited production components.  

OTOH, ICEVs are built in massive numbers.  The economy of scale kicked in 
long ago, and in most cases the engineering is derivative and was amortized 
years since.  So of course they are cheaper to build.  

A new product can be priced higher than the old version as long as it 
provides tangible benefits that the customer is willing to pay for.  
Regrettably, much as we all love the EV grin, an EV's benefits >to the 
customer< are still relatively subtle.  This is especially true since ICEVs 
have in recent years become quieter, smoother, and more reliable despite 
their mind-boggling complexity.

Until liquid fuel gets much more expensive - and, more importantly, a lot 
harder to get - an EV's benefits are mainly to society as a whole.  I'll 
stop there, and leave the rest as an exercise for the reader, since politics 
is a no-no here on the EVDL.
