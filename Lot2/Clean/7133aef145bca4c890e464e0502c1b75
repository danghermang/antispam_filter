Just to note that in ANTENNAS, 3rd edition, p. 219, John Kraus shows that an 
antenna consisting of 10 turns of 1 mm OD enameled copper wire wound on a 
ferrite rod 1 cm OD x 10 cm length having an effective relative permeability 
of 50 has a radiation resistance of 191 microhms at 1 MHz.

He also calculates its aperture efficiency as 0.06%, Q = 162, and HPBW = 
6.17 kHz.
