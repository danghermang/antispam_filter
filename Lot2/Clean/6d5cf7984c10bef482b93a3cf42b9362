Like Joseph, I was feeling somewhat 'left out' when I learned that others 
were getting (tempting ?) 'suggestions' from someone whose "name" keeps 
changing and I wasn't. However, apparently I've been added to his/her list. 
I've now received three such messages in the last 24 hours. My solution is 
Sharon's: hit DELETE.
