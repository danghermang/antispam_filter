Subject:[Flexradio] PowerSDR with WSJT-X JT9-1 Operation?
I am decoding JT9-1 signals just fine, but no one has been able to 
decode my signals including myself while running full duplex into a 
dummy load. This new experimental program has separate selections for 
the different VAC drivers available. I am using the WDM-KS in both 
PowerSDR and WSJT-X.

Has anyone had a successful JT9 QSO with a Flex-5000 using VAC and WSJT-X?

WSJT-X is an experimental release, so may be a bug or my setup.
