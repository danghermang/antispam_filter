Subject:Re: [Hsqldb-user] re   g: load only required columns
TEXT table indexes are stored in memory. You do not need any explicit
index or primary key for your table, therefore only one internal index
is created.

You do not need to change the text cache settings.

There may be a line in your text table which cannot be loaded because it
is not formatted correctly. Alternatively, memory may be running out,
which can be fixed by increasing the Java heap space.
