Subject:[Birding-Aus] 27 days to make a submission to Parks Victoria and
	ban dogs in a National Park
There are 27 days to write a submission to Parks Victoria.

During the 2011/12 summer  98% of breeding attempts by Hooded Plovers in the Mornington Peninsula National Park failed, (BirdLife Australia/Parks Victoria). Previous breeding seasons were not much better, see hoodedplover.com  It is suspected there are fewer than 600 Hooded Plover in Victoria, (BirdLife Australia).

One of the reasons for this poor breeding success in this National Park is thought to be the regulation that allows dogs on ocean beaches where Hooded Plovers nest. To rectify this anomaly of allowing domestic animals in a National Park, Parks Victoria are seeking submissions to a strategy that considers a ban on dogs. 

Below is the link to the Parks Victoria web site where information on the strategy is located as well as instructions on how to lodge a submission.

Please read the options carefully and lodge a submission thereby helping to protect Hooded Plover Chicks in this National Park.
