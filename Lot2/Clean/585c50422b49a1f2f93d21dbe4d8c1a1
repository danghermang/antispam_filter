Subject:[rescue] 256MB PC100 ECC Reg. DIMMs needed
I recently got a IBM B50 (rack mount version of the 43p/150), but the only
memory I had in the parts bin that worked was a
single 128MB DIMM.

Anyone here have some 168-pin SDRAM ECC Registered DIMMS to sell? According to
the docs PC100
up to 256MB works, but I don' t know about PC133 or larger sizes - this is
IBM, so it might work, or it might '888'.

I'm in western Washington.
