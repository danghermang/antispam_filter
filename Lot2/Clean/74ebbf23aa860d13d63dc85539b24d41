As proposed, there would be a $100/yr end-user maintenance 
fee for each of the IPv4 block and for each AS number (for a 
total of $200/year in your example)

There has been some discussion to include end-user maintenance 
for 1 IPv4 block, 1 IPv6 block, and 1 AS number for a single $100 
annual fee, and $100 for each additional resource.  If that change 
is adopted, your total would be $100/year.

FYI,
