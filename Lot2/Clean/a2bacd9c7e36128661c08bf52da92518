How is that possible ? Between  1st July 2011 and 30th June 2012,
we bought Mata (23m), Lukaku (20m), Meireles (12m), Courtois (6m),
De Bruyne (6m) and Cahill (7m). Not sure about Hazard - the deal was
announced in May 2012, but he might have only officially joined in July
2012. But while some players left for free at the end of their contracts,
our only significant outgoing transfers during that 12 month period were
Alex (5m) and Zhirkov (13m). Difficult to see how this generated a 29m 
profit.
