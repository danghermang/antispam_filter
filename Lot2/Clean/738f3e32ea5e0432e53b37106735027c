Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] OT- Hurricane Sandy
Hello Listers
=A0
One thing guys dont forget to pack up there meteorites :)
As for me I am staying in Brooklyn, I think for the most part
NYC will be fine. Last year the hurricane came and went =

and everything was normal for the most part of the Big Apple.
But else where, like NJ and other areas, there was a lot of
flooding. Good luck to all on the eastcoast.
