Subject:[CT Birds] Pegasus Ibis Stratford
From Frank Mantlik,
10/23. Stratford, Short Beach Park- minutes ago I saw a dark immature Plegadis IBIS (probably Glossy) fly out from the tidal lagoon, across the river, then NE heading to the Charles Wheeler salt marsh at Milford Point. Very late.
Also lots of the usual sparrows (and Myrtle Warblers) around.
