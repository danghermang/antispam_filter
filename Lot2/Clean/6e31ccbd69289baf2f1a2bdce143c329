 As I understand it, you do not support changing from a single 
 $100 end-user maintenance fee for unlimited number of resources 
 to having a $100 maintenance fee per resource, is that correct?

 If the proposed fees were modified (as has also been discussed)
 such that the first $100 maintenance fee covered 1 IPv4 prefix,
 1 IPv6 prefix, and 1 AS number, would you then be in support?

Thanks,
