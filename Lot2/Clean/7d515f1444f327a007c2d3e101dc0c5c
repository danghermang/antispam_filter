A friend of mine recently made an embroidered ruff (1575-ish) using the
simple stitches on her regular machine.  And she says, when you look at the
portrait she was copying (Lady Lincoln), it looks almost exactly like the
hand embroidery--same design.

Subject: [h-cost] Machine embroidery

Although it would be nice to do hand embroidery, realistically I have too
many other things on my schedule.  For a while I toyed with the idea of
getting a  high-end sewing/embroidery machine, but I already have two
perfectly good sewing machines and a huge price tag is a bit intimidating.
I am thinking of buying a Brother PE770, which is a fairly inexpensive
dedicated embroidery machine.  It takes a flash drive so I can import
designs from my computer.

I want to do historic embroidery designs and I want to create or at least
customize my own.  I'm used to using graphic design software (scan editing
and draw programs), but I know little about embroidery design software.  Any
suggestions?
