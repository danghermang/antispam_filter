Subject:Re: [SLED] Examples of Counseling & Preaching in Second Life (or
	other virtual worlds)
I am still looking for examples of counseling and preaching (or as close as
you can get to it) classes in virtual worlds. Many of our students come to
us with credentials from Liberty University Online and there is a feeling in
many in our leadership that counseling and preaching cannot be taught
virtually. I am trying to make the case that it's a matter of development
and methodology. Counseling and preaching could be taught, perhaps not in
the way Liberty is doing it now but in virtual worlds, with improved methods
and development and the right equipment. In fact there could be all kinds of
additional benefits such as the backchannel discussions we all know is so
valuable at virtual conferences and classes.

So can anyone give me proof cases of classes where counseling classes and
something like preaching or other classes which are usually done
face-to-face can be effectively done online (and any metrics would be an
extreme help).

Thanks.  Paul V
