I understand there is no DBD-mysql package because there simply is no
MySQL install on the package builder. But the benefit for me of using
a binary distribution such as ActivePerl is the fact that I do not
need to bother about compiling these modules myself. I had some issues
when I wanted to compile DBD::mysql on the system perl which is why I
wanted to use ActivePerl in the first place.

And yes, it would be very helpful for other ActivePerl users if
someone at ActiveState would make sure there is a DBD-mysql package
available on OS X.
