Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Mills Zephyr Amplifier Question
Peter,
What you are describing sounds like a old wax capacitor.  It is not only pos=
sible but probable that this part has gone bad. It is common but not good pr=
actice that someone took the time to rebuild the amp but not replace all cap=
acitors. I've seen it many times. At least, all old capacitors need to be ch=
anged along with any out of tolerance resistors and tubes should be checked a=
s well.  If you are not comfortable or knowledgeable working on tube amplifi=
ers I would highly recommend finding someone who knows these amps well.=20
