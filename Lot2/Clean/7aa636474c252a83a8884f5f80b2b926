> It corresponds to about 50 references, collected most of them one by one, over the years. The references (books and article offprints) span from the late 19th century to nowadays. Authors include Buchwald, Fletcher, Nininger and many more. The lot also contains a rare series of Russian articles, all signed/inscribed, from the Brian Mason estate.
