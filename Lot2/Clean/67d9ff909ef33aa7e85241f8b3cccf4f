Subject:Re: [MG] [Ag Meinungsfindungstool] International E-Democracy Talk
Hi Ed,

Currently we started with a wiki page that we can use to organize our 
E-Democracy Talk. Maybe we can move that page to metagovernment.org later or 
sync or link to or whatever. The wiki page is not ready yet, but I hope we 
got this managed by end of the week.
http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Meinungsfindungstool/E-democracy_talk

And we have two next possible speakers on hold, and there are others of 
course. So we may need to establish a kind of process to find out the next 
E-Democracy Talk session first...

Cheers
marc

Then let's move on to the more fun aspect of this administrivia (and back to 
marc's original question)... what should the next topic be. Or more broadly, 
what should the theme of these meetings be?

Suggestions? If we have numerous suggestions, then we can formalize the 
selection process, but for the moment, please speak up if you have an idea 
for anything that would be of interest to the community of people working on 
our various democracy projects. Guest lecturers; topic debates, addressing 
cross-project problems, collaborating on outreach, organizing a 
cross-project funding mechanism... what do you think?


P.S. If it hasn't been evident, my participation has been rather low as 
there have been several heavy demands on my time. I will do what I can to 
facilitate these meetings, but would certainly appreciate any help anyone 
would like to volunteer.
