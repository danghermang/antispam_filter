Subject:[Koha] Koha Config All stored in Database?
Hello,

When setting up a Koha server using the debian packages is the koha 
configuration all stored in the mysql database? I would be very happy if 
that wasn't the case, as I then could track my configuration follies using a 
VCS as git ...

Thank you for any insight into the matter.

Sincerely, Joh
