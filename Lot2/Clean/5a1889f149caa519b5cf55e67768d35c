Today we did neither well. Torres was normal (ie useless), the attacking 
trio did no find each other. Rami needs to start. Mikel was mostly ok. 
Romeu had his chance and blew it.

Anyway start playing Bertrand, not Cole. Azpi did nothing for attack so 
Brana needs to start at full back.

Could have been 0-0 or even a defeat. Get Terry and Mata in and we are a 
different team. I hope. We cant lose to Shakhtar.

Well, a few Laphroighs should ease my pain.
