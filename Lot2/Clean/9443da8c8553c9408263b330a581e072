Subject:Re: [arin-ppml] REVISED: Draft Policy ARIN-2012-8: Aligning 8.2 and
 8.3 Transfer Policy
TL;DR I don't agree with forcing people under RSAs especially the
latest one just "because".

I've been on the other side of the "which version of the RSA"
discussion.  ARIN refuses to allow you to re-sign or sign a copy of
the RSA that applied at the time of the registration/transfer/action
unless it is the current RSA.  All ARIN really has to do is refuse to
accept the RSA.  ARIN is a monopoly, if they do not accept a document
from you, there is not much you can do.

Remember, because of ARINs own mistake (and I very much do thank John
for researching and correcting it) I was caught in a circle where I
could not update a ASN that I had the right to update, that I paid for
every year.  Had John not found the issue, there would be over 2000
other organizations caught in the same limbo.
