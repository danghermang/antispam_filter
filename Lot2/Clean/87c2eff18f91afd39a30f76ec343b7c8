Subject:[child_lit] Locations in Children's Lit - The LIST!
Dear friends,

Wow thank you! What a wonderful list, and such fun to think of where to put
my guests. I had already thought about whether or not to include Panem
and/or District 12, and decided against it based on the fact that I don't
want my guests to starve or die :o)

In case you're interested, some of my other ideas, since these can also
work for library and school programs:

   - I'm going to make a sign that says "This way to the Wild Rumpus!" for
   the front of the building.
   - The candy bar will be called "Charlie's Chocolate Factory."
   - The drink table will be called "Wonderland" with little signs that say
   "drink me."
   - We will set up game tables for Settlers of Catan, Scrabble, Taboo,
   Harry Potter Scene It and Trivial Pursuit Booklovers Edition
   - My centerpieces will be 2 or 3 books with a vase of flowers. I wish I
   could theme each table according to the children's lit location, but ala=
s,
   budgetary restrictions.
   - Escort cards will look like old school card catalog cards in American
   Typewriter font
   - Our photo booth props will include the Suess hat, sorting hat, and
   other children's lit costumes
   - Kids bins including coloring books, crayons, puzzles, picture books to
   keep the little ones occupied :D

And here's the wonderful list you came up with (I added your suggestions to
