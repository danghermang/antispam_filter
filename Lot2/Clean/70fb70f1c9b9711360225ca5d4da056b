They at least have free trails so you can try it before you buy it. Astrid

Subject: [h-cost] Machine embroidery 

Although it would be nice to do hand embroidery, realistically I have 
too many other things on my schedule. For a while I toyed with the idea 
of getting a high-end sewing/embroidery machine, but I already have two 
perfectly good sewing machines and a huge price tag is a bit 
intimidating. I am thinking of buying a Brother PE770, which is a 
fairly inexpensive dedicated embroidery machine. It takes a flash drive 
so I can import designs from my computer. 

I want to do historic embroidery designs and I want to create or at 
least customize my own. I'm used to using graphic design software (scan 
editing and draw programs), but I know little about embroidery design 
software. Any suggestions?
