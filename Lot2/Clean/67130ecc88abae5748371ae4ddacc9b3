So, to recap right now at 158ish volts I'm pulling ~17a through one element.  I'm about to raise my voltage to 183v nominal.  The elements are very nicely imbedded in the heater core, it's actually a very nice install.  I'd LOVE it if I could keep the heaters in there physically as they are.

It is my understanding that if I rewire it so each element is (+) (empty) (-) (empty) (+) it will split the four elements into two series pairs, and run them in parallel.  This should reduce the current, and the heat output.  But if I wire both elements up that way and have them on together, I'm hoping the heat output should be comparable to the single core running overloaded like I had before.

Yes, right on track. Use both elements; otherwise you're getting cold 
air blowing in through the unused element, diluting your heating effect.

With resistive resistors, you would expect that if the 4 sections in 
parallel draw 17 amps, then the same 4 sections wired for 2 parallel 
pairs of 2 in series would have 4 times the resistance, and thus produce 
1/4th the heat.

But these elements are *not* resistors! Their apparent resistance 
changes drastically as a function of their temperature. Rewiring them as 
2 series pairs in parallel will cut your current about in half, and give 
you *half* the heat. But wiring both elements this way (left and right) 
will bring you right back to about the same 17 amps you had. But each 
element is now under a lot less stress, and will be safer and last a lot 
longer.

The best way to regulate the amount of heat you get with ceramic 
elements is to control the airflow through them. The more airflow, the 
more current they will draw, and the more heat they produce.
