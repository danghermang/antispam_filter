Does anyone have any experience with either the Canon Powershot SX40 
or SX50 digital camera?

Using Google, I have read one review of the SX50 that does not 
recommend it for wildlife photography.  It appears that the SX50 is 
the newer model for the SX40.

They both seem to suggest that they have a 0.5 to 0.7 second delay in 
taking the photo, which could be a problem, but then I found 
reference to a 0.15 second delay if you have pre focussed the shot 
for both cameras which should be fine.

One review compared the SX40 to the Nikon Coolpix P500.  Does anyone 
have experience with this camera?  Or what appears to be its 
successor the Nikon Coolpix P510?
