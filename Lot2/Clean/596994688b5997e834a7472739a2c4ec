Subject:[Coral-List] Two PhD scholarships - Nutritional interactions in
 cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis
Dear All,

I'm currently inviting applications for two PhD scholarships, to study nutritional interactions in cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The project is a collaboration with Prof.. Virginia Weis at Oregon State University and Prof. Arthur Grossman at Stanford University.

Applicants should have an outstanding academic track-record, and have completed either an Honours or Masters degree in an appropriate subject. A good knowledge of cell or molecular biology is highly desirable, as is a capacity to learn skills in proteomics and/or metabolomics. Further details of these scholarships, and how to apply, can be found at:

The closing date is 30th Nov 2012 (or until the positions are filled), with a preferred start date of 1st March 2013 (and 1st April 2013 at latest).

Further details can be obtained from Assoc. Prof. Simon Davy at simon.davy@vuw.ac.nz.

Best wishes,

Simon
