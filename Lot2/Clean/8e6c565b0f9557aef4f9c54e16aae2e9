Subject: Making Beacon Street better for bikes... October 15
To:


Greetings Somerville Cyclists,

There's a plan afoot to create Somerville's first ever cycle-track on
Beacon Street<https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1Y_jIpLYtpycEZNOUVTNUYxQVU/edit>.
Cycle tracks are protected bike lanes where you are physically separated by
some kind of barrier from cars.  The plan has been through one meeting
where there was a lot of support, but also some push back (the cycle-track
would involve taking out parking on one side of Beacon Street).

Beacon Street presents a first-in-the-city chance to unlock some of the 60%
of the population<http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/158497>who
are interested in biking but are too concerned about safety. About 5%
currently commute by bike in Somerville, yet we already have over 430 bikes
per hour on Beacon Street in the morning, or 50% of all vehicles! With
Cycle tracks, the number of cyclists would grow further.

If you want to encourage a cycle track on Beacon Street I recommend you
attend a meeting next Monday October 15th at 6:30 p.m. at Argenziano
School.

Also, if you want to be an official bike-nerd you can attend a fascinating
talk at Harvard that's happening that same day, but just before it.
Details are here.<http://www.livablestreets.info/event/cycling-and-walking-sustainable-cities-lessons-europe-and-north-america>

On the good news front... Bow Street bike lanes have gone from pilot to
permanent at the latest traffic committee meetings.

Please pass this along to other Somerville Cyclists. If you want to get on
(or off) this email list please email me.

Thanks for all your help!

Mark
