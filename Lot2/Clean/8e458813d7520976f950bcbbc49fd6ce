Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] NASA SETI Misappropriation of Tax Payer Funds
Hello Greg and List!

It was my understanding that the airship rides were contributed.  Is
there reliable information that they're plunking down NASA-dollars
for that?  Because I agree - that'd be pretty criminal.

Believe me, no one could possibly be any crankier about
misappropriation of tax-payer dollars than I!  I just want to make
sure we string up the "right ones".
