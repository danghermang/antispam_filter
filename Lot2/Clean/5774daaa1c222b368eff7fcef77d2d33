Subject:Re: [child_lit] Penguin and Random House merge
Via Bookslut, here's what Dennis Johnson of Melville House has to say about
the merger:

The new entity would control reportedly 25% of the U.S. book market. This
will probably intensify the winner-take-all trends that have been growing
in publishing lately. I'm guessing author advances will go down, especially
for the midlist authors -- the fewer bidding entities there are, the less
motivation to outbid the other guy.
