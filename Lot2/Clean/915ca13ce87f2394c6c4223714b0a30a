Subject:[EVDL] DC motors/chain saw
>From: Chris Tromley <ctromley@gmail.com>
 If it binds, you muscle it to stall and hold it until it fries
(do these things typically have a breaker or fuse?) or hope you can
separate the plug with your foot.  Or it goes flying.  Is there some other
scenario I'm missing?

I did have some thoughts about doing this better , one was to use the
ground wire to control a contactor back at the plug/battery pack . the
saw switch would feed power to the ground wire which would switch on
contact or and make both other wire's hot . You'd need a 150v coil on
contactor and re wiring of saw. A fuse just big enough to blow if the
saw binds . and last which would have worked out nicely for me as I
had a controller on the mower , some kind of 0 to 5k throttle so as to
use the mower controller for all my tools that I powered with the
mower .
