Rival platforms (such as S2) are simply eliminated until a single
platform is left standing.  That platform becomes the de facto
monopoly.

Personally, I don't like this outcome.  T3 could easily be Votorola
and S2 could be Outcast.  I chose to work on those, and I don't want
to be forced out of my work, or to lose my freedom of choice.  This is
where I have a personal concern with the common platform that's being
mooted by AG Meinungsfindungstool.
