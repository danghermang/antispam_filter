John,
It has been my experience, that when any Micro-Switch ( or any other "seale=
d", brand switch) "adjustment" changes--the switch needs to be replaced !=
=A0=A0 Ron Rich=20

Hi Shankar,

Along with the other suggestions, is the machine making the normal write-in=
 sounds "Bzzzzz-Click" or are either of=A0 those sounds changed? A longer B=
zzz usually means a problem with either the Stop or Reversing microswitch i=
n the selection assembly. With luck it is only an adjustment - do that to t=
he manual, but do check the switch resistance with an ohmmeter to make sure=
 the internal microswitch contacts are under 1 Ohm between C and NC and NO =
when relaxed/tripped.
