Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Well .......
No, I am not.  When he plays next to JT, he seems to be kept under control
a bit better but when left to his own devices his decision making can be
suspect.
It's as if he has a 'mad moment'.

It gives me no pleasure and is definitely unscientific, however some journo
quotes from the papers:

*It was a silly mistake by Luiz who brought the ball out of defence and was
**easily caught out by Rafael's challenge*. - Independent

*...the Chelsea defender then reminded us of his own capacity for inviting
trouble, running over the halfway line with the ball and being caught in
possession.*
*The Lu=EDz slalom undoubtedly looks good when it comes off, but it also has
a **habit of endangering his team when he loses possession.*  -  Guardian

*Chelsea fans were then treated to the bad side of Luiz, the careless side.
He lost the ball in midfield, allowing Anderson to release Javier
Hern=E1ndez, who placed
his shot unerringly past Cech. Roman Abramovich and his friend Andrei
**Shevchenko
looked at each other in frustration*.  -  Telegraph

*Unfortunately for Chelsea, there is far too much nonsense with David Luiz.
Carrying the ball across the halfway line does not constitute*
*nonsense =97 even if plenty of coaches in England might disagree =97 but *=
*doing
so with reckless abandon does*.  -  Times

*The Brazil defender played more of a role in United=92s second goal, taking
the ball up field before watching it cannon back into Chelsea=92s*
*half. With the centre half stranded, Hernandez exploited the huge
gap....* -  Mail

*Unfortunately for Chelsea, that goal seemed to convince Luiz that he was a
striker rather than a centre-half and charging recklessly*
*forward, he lost possession to Rafael and left a gaping hole behind him
for Anderson to thread a pass through to Javier Hernandez.

Roman Abramovich, sitting next to Andrey Shevchenko in his executive box,
slumped deep into his seat as his team suffered yet another*
*self-inflicted wound from the =A322million Brazilian.*  -  Sun

Don't get me wrong, Luiz entertains me and can produce some magical
moments, but I am not so blinded by this that I cannot accept his
weaknesses.
I think if I were looking for an ideal description for him it would be that
he can be a 'loose cannon'
