Thanks for you blog reference Michelle - it was really interesting and
helpful. I referred to it on my Create a Kids' Book Facebook page, and
probably will in my monthly bulletin as well. =


I wondered if you needed the learning difficulty specifically named? Because
there are a couple with sidekicks who are "slow" - "The Turbulent Term of
Tyke Tyler" for one (I can't remember his/her friend's name) and another
really great Australian one I read a couple of years ago, and will chase up
if you think it would be helpful.

And do you want picture books? The ones that come to mind are:

 "Arabella" by Wendy Orr and Kim Gamble (the wheelchair is never mentioned
in the text, and nor seen clearly until the last page after his adventure is
over - when you can go back and find it subtly on many of the openings) This
says (without saying it in words) that kids in a wheelchair can have
exciting adventures, and that the wheelchair is the least important thing
about them - just lovely. =


"The Red Tree" - Shaun Tan (depression of child)

"Big and Me" - David Miller (mental health of an adult and child coping with
it - in the form of machines)

"The Race" - Christobel Mattingly and Anne Spudvilas (deafness)

"The Black Book of Colours" - Menena Cottin - Rosana Faria (to explain
colour to blind kids, and lack of colour to sighted ones) =


I'll probably think of more, if picture books are of help.

Subject: [child_lit] HIT: Main Characters with Learning Problems (all
levels)

Hi Everyone!

Thank you all so much for your suggestions of book titles. I received quite
a mix of 'learning problems'. The list is quite long so i posted it on my
blog (link below).
http://librarymom.edublogs.org/

I figure that would be easiest for everyone to read/save. I was looking for
books with main characters that have learning problems/disabilities.
If anyone can think of other titles that has a main character with learning
difficulties such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, etc., please let me
know, I'd love to add them to the list.

Thank you all again!
Michelle
