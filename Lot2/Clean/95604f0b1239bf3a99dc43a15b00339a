Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] 1/2-wave vertical really needs a ground
	plane?
Hello Greg,

All end fed antennas require radials or a counterpoise. If we don't use
one, then something else (such as the outside of the feedline) will become
the counterpoise, and that can cause problems. See AA5TB's new article at
http://www.antennex.com/library/Nov12/Nov512/intro_nnotes-efhalf.htm

I have a page about grounds at
http://www.w0btu.com/Optimum_number_of_ground_radials_vs_radial_length.html.
