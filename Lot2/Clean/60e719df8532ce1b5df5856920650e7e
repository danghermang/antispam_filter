Subject:[EVDL] How do I drive my EV?
I've been a member of this listserve for a few years now, but mostly a lurk=
er.=A0
Got my EV up and running this summer and have been working bugs out since t=
hen (mostly battery issues).=A0
Here are the specs:
1979 VW Bus
ADC 4001 Motor
Open Revolt DIY 144v 500ah controller
No Clutch- direct drive into stock manual tranny
Stock tires (185 R14 -yes, that's correct) inflated to max PSI
120v pack of 6vx20 Sam's Club ECG2s=A0
voltmeters on every set (2) batteries, so I can watch closely voltage sag a=
nd whatnot.=A0

So at first, I was driving it like I would normally hypermile an ICE- slowl=
y, keep the RMPs LOW stay mostly in 2nd gear, even when starting off. But m=
y pack would only safely last me about 20 or so miles before my DOD would g=
et too low.=A0
I found a very informative PDF about driving an EV in the EVDL library, whi=
ch basically said to stay in 1st up to 25mph, and keep the RPMs HIGH for ef=
ficiency. All of a sudden those torque drawings started making sense =A0(I =
always thought they were written backwards or something). =A0So now I keep =
it in 1st up to about 25-30 mph and my mileage has gone way up! But I start=
ed wondering about the Redline or Over-rev of my motor. How high was too hi=
gh? I have a good *feel* for torque and motor response and throttle input, =
so I can feel when it' time to shift UP to 2nd to get more torque to climb =
a hill. But I can't find the actual "redline" for my motor in official docu=
ments anywhere- I've *read online* it's anywhere from 5000-8000, but I can'=
t find anything really narrow it down.=A0
99% of my driving is in the city of Philadlephia, so the speed limit is bet=
ween 25-40mph. Shifting isn't easy, so I *like* to leave it in one gear, bu=
t sometimes I wonder if I'm getting too high in 1st, or loosing too much of=
 my batteries if I start out in 2nd and stay there.=A0
I did some calculations to figure out my RPMs from my MPH, but I was gettin=
g about 6000rpms @25mph! That seemed really high, but, like I said, the mot=
or *felt* fine, not like I needed to upshift.=A0
I'm sure this is covered often, but my "search" didn't come up with much mo=
re than I already learned.=A0
Can anyone help me out?
Thanks!
Joel in Philly=A0
