When I'm due an upgrade next year I'm going to be looking at the Samsung 
Galaxy S3 as I already have a Galaxy S, however I'm not going to rule 
out what else is out there too (I believe LG have brought out a new 
fancy Android and the new Sony phones look quite nice).

Big thing for me is what offers I can get on contract too.
