Subject:Re: [address-policy-wg] [Ticket#2012110601002595] Status of /24 PI
 IPv4 from last /8

Hi Tore,

To clarify: the original proposed transfer policy had no limitations
included whatsoever. We ended up with all the limitations in there as a
compromise to get any transfer policy reaching consensus at all within the
RIPE NCC service region, being the first region in the world with a
transfer policy in place back in the day. As other regions have now
adopted transfer policies as well, the one in hte RIPE NCC resion is now
by far the most restrictive, and I would encourage anyone to do a proposal
to remove some or all of the limitations in current policy.

Best

(one of the authors of the current transfer policy)
