Subject:Re: [Hsqldb-user] Comparing strings with null values
Versions up to 1.7.2 (8 years old) had this deficiency in comparing NULL
to a value.

As suggested by A.S., adding a DEFAULT clause with NOT NULL constraints
on the relevant columns looks like the best solution.

If you are inserting / updating your data in too many places, you can
add a "BEFORE" TRIGGER to the table to check the relevant values for
NULL and replace them with the default value.

However, you also have the following options:

1. Standard SQL option of using IS DISTINCT FROM for your comparison
when the column value could be NULL.

WHERE customer.name IS DISTINCT FROM 'foo' =


2. Standard SQL predicates which allow an index on the column to be used
for searching, which improves the query speed with large tables.

WHERE column.name IS NULL OR  column.name > 'foo' OR column.name < 'foo'
