Lauren, Thanks for the link!!

Not a lehenga choli like those pictures. No. The top is a *tunic* and  
not a choli. It's as if you were to take a Punjabi pantsuit *tunic*  
and place it over the long lovely skirt from the Lehenga choli.

I'll find time later to post the pic of me wearing it. I'm  
unforgivably paleface, but the outfit is nice :)
