Subject:[EVDL] water pump orientation
I picked up a Topsflo 15PV 12VDC pump to use with the hot water heating 
system in my EV.

This pump uses a magnetically coupled impeller. The documentation doesn't 
mention anything about pump orientation. I am thinking that this pump can 
only be used in the horizontal position because otherwise the impeller would 
rub against the pump housing.

Does anyone know for sure whether this type of pump can be used in anything 
other than a horizontal position?

Thanks, Al
