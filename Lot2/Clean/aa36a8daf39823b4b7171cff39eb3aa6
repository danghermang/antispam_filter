Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Wire for 1939 Mills Zephyr jukebox
Modern wire is OK, and replacing it with a larger gauge is also OK. I
wouldn't use a smaller gauge because it may not be able to handle the
current the box requires and you risk overheating or in the worst case, a
fire. In my restorations, I've used cloth covered wire, actually a
lacquered cotton braid finish, from Antique
Electronics(http://www.tubesandmore.com). It looks fairly authentic and I
have been happy with the results.
