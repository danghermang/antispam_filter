For Bix Beiderbecke
(The Ear Inn, March 13, 2011)
Didja see this
Will Friedwald article in the Wall Street Journal?
  He talked about the EarRegulars and
featured us among his Valentine's Day date recommendations.
http://on.wsj.com/fYum6c
Nate Chinen
included The EarRegulars in
his JazzTimes article
about the 10
most memorable performances he saw during in 2010,
"
Traditional jazz has a hardy roost in the
Ear
Inn
, a historic Lower Manhattan bar where trumpeter Jon-Erik Kellso and the guitarist
Matt Munisteri hold court on Sunday nights.
"

Today, Sunday, 11/11/12 8-11:00-ish at
the Ear Inn:
Joining me will be
Grant Stewart
on tenor sax, Chris Flory on guitar and
Jon Burr
on bass. Psyched to be back at the Ear!
It's best to get there early to secure your spot, and bring an appetite if you'd
rather sit at a table than at the bar.
The Ear Inn is at
326 Spring St.
,
between Washington and Greenwich streets,
way out west in Soho near the Holland Tunnel.
It's one of the oldest bars in
New York
with a very interesting history going back to 1817.
No cover or minimum, but please visit Phillup DeBucket
(that's our less-than-subtle way of letting you know we have a tip jar).
Come as you are and say hi to Michael & J.P., our wonderful new bartenders. Food's
yummy and inexpensive. It's always a fun hang!
Parking's usually pretty easy there, or
you can take the 1 train to Houston
, exit via King St., then walk south 3 blocks and west 3 blocks,
or take the C or E train to Spring St., and walk west a few blocks.
Sneak peek coming attractions at the Ear:
Nov. 18th Scott Robinson and I will be up to our old tricks, and trying out some
new ones.
Dec. 30th bassist Nicki Parrott will be anchoring the EarRegulars.
