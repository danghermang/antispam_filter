Subject:[CT Birds] Presumed Tundra Swans-Oxford
Yesterday morning there were at least 6 non-Mute Swans flying near
Jackson's Cove in Oxford. I didn't have the best looks as they flew with
timber in my way, but I could see they were not Mutes. Also friday morning
near my house in Cos Cob I had a few Redpolls overhead.
