Subject:backports kernel: support for t430s laptop in backports?
Hi folks,

on my shiny new t430s laptop the external display is not detected
at run time (HD4000 graphics). Especially I cannot make use of a
beamer, which is highly painful. For Wheezy there is no such problem,
but unfortunately Wheezy is not an option yet.

lspci shows me for Squeeze's backports kernel (3.2.0-0.bpo.4-amd64):

00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Device 0154 (rev 09)
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Device 0166 (rev 09)
00:14.0 USB Controller: Intel Corporation Device 1e31 (rev 04)
00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation Device 1e3a (rev 04)
00:16.3 Serial controller: Intel Corporation Device 1e3d (rev 04)
00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection (rev 04)
00:1a.0 USB Controller: Intel Corporation Device 1e2d (rev 04)
00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation Device 1e20 (rev 04)
00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device 1e10 (rev c4)
00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device 1e12 (rev c4)
00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device 1e14 (rev c4)
00:1d.0 USB Controller: Intel Corporation Device 1e26 (rev 04)
00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Device 1e55 (rev 04)
00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation Device 1e03 (rev 04)
00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation Device 1e22 (rev 04)
03:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation 6000 Series Gen2 (rev 34)
04:00.0 System peripheral: Ricoh Co Ltd MMC/SD Host Controller (rev 07)

If I boot wheezy with kernel 3.2.0-4-amd64 (of course I tried),
then lspci recognizes all the hardware:

00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor DRAM Controller (rev 09)
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)
00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB xHCI Host Controller (rev 04)
00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 (rev 04)
00:16.3 Serial controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family KT Controller (rev 04)
00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection (rev 04)
00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #2 (rev 04)
00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04)
00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev c4)
00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 2 (rev c4)
00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 3 (rev c4)
00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1 (rev 04)
00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation QM77 Express Chipset LPC Controller (rev 04)
00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 7 Series Chipset Family 6-port SATA Controller [AHCI mode] (rev 04)
00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller (rev 04)
03:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6205 (rev 34)
04:00.0 System peripheral: Ricoh Co Ltd MMC/SD Host Controller (rev 07)

Actually both kernels should be the same, so how comes that
the Squeeze backports kernel doesn't recognize the hardware?
Is this an udev issue?


Any helpful comment would be highly appreciated
