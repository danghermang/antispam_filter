Subject:[CT Birds] Magnolia Warbler Stamford
Late this after noon while out on a first walk through my neighborhood in Shippan since Sandy, there was a Magnolia Warbler sitting on the barrier wall at West Beach near Rippowam Rd. & Wampanaw Ave.  There was also a juvenile Black-crowned Night-Heron in the cove behind the A&E building at the end of Harbor Dr. along with 3 Brant.

The following post on Mass Birds was of interest and motivating to go out hoping to see some warblers:

Massbird,



It is probably obvious to many already, but the aftermath of Hurricane

Sandy has yielded yet another very interesting avian event. Over the past

few days the southwesterly winds seem to have brought a number of really

odd passerines to the area. I think it is clear that the southwesterlies

have triggered this event.



I strongly recommend careful checks of any known coastal migrant traps or

good spots for late lingering birds in the next few days. The effects of

this passerine arrival may be seen for up to a week or more, but the sooner

you get out looking, the better.



I expect coastal spots to be best and maybe the southern coastline (s

Bristol Co., s Plymouth Co., and s and e shores of Cape Cod) will be best,

although checking the South SHore and North Shore is certainly important if

only to help us learn how widely this phenomenon occurs.



A short list of recent unseasonal sightings includes:



- Eastern Wood-Pewee at Allen's Pond 31 Oct, photographed by Paul Champlin



- Bay-breasted Warbler (clearly recent arrival off ocean) and Northern

Parula in same coastal thicket at Gooseberry Neck 1 Nov (with

Orange-crowned and Clay-colored Sparrow). Photos now added here:

- Yellow-throated Warbler in Rhode Island 1 Nov



- Multiple Cave Swallows and a Western Kingbird in Rhode Island 1 Nov



- Tennessee Warbler in Arlington 2 Nov (Marj. Rines)



- Cape May Warbler at Wellfleet Bay WS 2 Nov (M. Faherty)



Causality is not always clear when rare birds turn up, but in this case,

the combination of favorable southwesterlies and the above list of birds

(including several at coastal thickets indicating recent arrival) seems to

make things pretty clear. I am catching up from a week of storm-chasing

south to PA and MD (VERY interesting!) so am writing this off the cuff,

without looking at listservs from other states or detailed weather maps. So

it would be great to have others add to the species list above from news

elsewhere or to the weather component.



Mostly, I wanted to raise the alarm and make sure folks check coastal spots

for landbirds if they can! I checked Manomet Pt. this morning but other

than Blackpoll and Western Palm (both expected) and House Wren (slightly

late) had nothing unusual.



And, of course, we should *expect* there to be more lapwings around.

Cumbies, Argilla Rd., airports, golf courses, southern Bristol County

fields, Waltham athletic fields, and any other spot good for Killdeer

should be checked for lapwings as soon as possible. Remember that the 1927

weather event involved *hundreds* of lapwings (in December, but still).

Surely more than three survived the trans-Atlantic crossing, and our

challenge now is to find them. Be alert also for other shorebirds from

Iceland, like Eurasian Oystercatcher, Common Redshank, European

Golden-Plover, etc., just to be safe!



Best,



Marshall Iliff
