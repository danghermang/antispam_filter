Subject:[Birding-Aus] Pt Lookout, N Stradbroke Is, SEQ 28.10.12
A seawatch from Pt Lookout (8-10.30) today produced the expected
Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (100/hr) and much fewer Short-tailed (35/hr)
and 4 Artic and 6 Pomarine Skuas, and a single unexpected Sooty
Shearwater - all heading south in the 30+ kn SE winds.
At least 2 Lesser Crested Terns roosting near the water taxi terminal
seemed a bit late in the season for Moreton Bay? 

Cheers

Colin
