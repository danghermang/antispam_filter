Subject:Re: [routing-wg] MERIT Darknet Experiment and RPKI alerts
Overall, I think this is very dangerous approach, and the wrong way to start with.

There might be very good reasons, why a full block of (IPv6) addresses, or a
subset of, ist not (yet) globally visible. Announcing/Hijacking those addresses
may seriously interfere with local tests or pilot deployment.

IMHO this should be strictly opt-in, instead of opt-out!
