What's new in ActivePerl
========================

ActivePerl 5.16 is now based on the 5.16.1 release. You can read about all
the changes since Perl 5.16.0 in the perldelta document:

  http://docs.activestate.com/activeperl/5.16/lib/pods/perl5161delta.html

In addition, the 64-bit version of ActivePerl 5.16.1 for Windows now
automatically supports building and installing additional modules with
MinGW64 and dmake. These tools are available via PPM the same way MinGW
has already been supported in the 32-bit version.

Also improved is the way Perl will automatically configure itself on
Mac OS X to the installed version of XCode to locate the GCC compiler
and tools.
