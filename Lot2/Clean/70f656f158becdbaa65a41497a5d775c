Ward,

Various comments:

1.   All too many textbooks retreat, when pressed, to statements like 
"Kirchhoff's circuit laws
apply only to static circuits".

It is true that these laws were originally stated for DC circuits.

But the entire field of electrical engineering depends on being able to use 
Kirchhoff's "laws" in AC circuits with "good enough" results.

So, it is a shame that textbooks don't try to explain why these "laws" are 
"good enough" for engineers, even if they are not strictly "exact" except 
for DC circuits.

I recently wrote a tech note
http://puhep1.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/volt.pdf
in which I give my story as to where and why Kirchhoff's laws work as well 
as they do.

When I sent this note to 2 prominent educators at MIT who deal with 
undergraduate electricity and magnetism courses, they said this subject was 
too complicated for them, and they tell the students that AC circuit 
analysis is a kind of swindle.     I was appalled by this attitude.

However, antenna systems are cases where one has to be careful about using 
Kirchhoff's laws, as they don't always hold very well here.

2.  Something that is implicit in Kirchhoff's "laws" for AC circuits is that 
the currents considered in these "laws" can be "displacement currents" as 
well as ordinary conduction currents.

Otherwise, one couldn't speak of the current IN a capacitor (in contrast to 
the current into and out of a capacitor).

Similarly, in thinking about antennas, it is useful to consider that 
"displacement current" can flow from one arm of a dipole to another, thereby 
"completing the circuit".

3.  In an end-fed linear antenna, one can likewise consider that 
"displacement current" flows between the lone arm of the antenna and the 
"other" antenna lead.

This vision makes it easy to appreciate that the "displacement current" does 
not all flow onto the tip/terminal of the "other" lead, but can flow onto it 
over some distance (~ lambda) from that tip.

In particular, if the leads are in the form of a coaxial cable, and the 
"other" lead is the outer conductor, we understand that in general some of 
the "return displacement current" flows onto the outside of the outer 
conductor.    In this case the outer conductor of the coax is "really" part 
of the antenna, and we get into the topic of "feedline antennas"......

I have often pointed people to a nice article about tricks one can play with 
coaxial cables to make then into good antennas, in which the center 
conductor is extended to be an "end-fed monopole".   No ground planes are 
needed if you are content to use part of the outer conductor of the coax as 
part of the "antenna".

Folks:
   While I personally subscribe to the view conveyed by w8ji there
are detractors.  The argument starts like this, "Kirchhoff's law doesn't 
always
apply".  Then hands are waved and measurements presented.
   I happen to think Kirchhoff's law does apply but the arguments can
be compelling.  I know I can build an antenna which has radiating
elements which have NO direct electrical connection to the feed line.
Somehow, currents are induced and therefore Kirchhoff's circuit
law doesn't apply.
   I expect the physicists to say something like "Kirchhoff's circuit laws
apply only to static circuits".  Anyone?

   Just a flare to engage the brain cells.

The link below has an interesting discussion of this subject, including a 
section titled "Can we end-feed a halfwave antenna, or end-feed any antenna, 
without a ground or counterpoise?"
