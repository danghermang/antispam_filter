There is no museum in any of Kit Pearson's books, but there is a cemetery
with an angel statue in Awake and Dreaming and a library in the Sky is
Falling.

I apologize for how vague these suggestions are. I've had to place most of
my books and files in storage for a couple of years, so I don't have
physical access to them. Hence I often can't cite specifics, but maybe the
titles will jog someone's better memory or library. I'll begin with those
I'm sure of: 

In Noel Streatfeild's BALLET SHOES, the three sisters are taken on a walk to
see the dollhouses at the Victoria & Albert Museum most days. 

In American Jean Davies Okimoto's THE ECLIPSE OF MOONBEAM DAWSON, a pivotal
scene takes place in a museum (either UBC's Museum of Anthropology or the
Royal British Columbia Museum) involving artworks by the great Haida artist
Bill Reid. 

In Edward Eager's THE TIME GARDEN, don't the children visit Orchard House,
once the Alcott family home, now a museum, in Concord, MA? 

Australian Cassandra Gold's THE MUSEUM OF MARY CHILD features a created
museum. 

THE EDIBLE WOMAN, Margaret Atwood's first novel, which I would characterize
as crossover YA, set in Toronto, has a memorable scene inside the Royal
Ontario Museum's ancient Egyptian room. 

And works by other Canadian writers: I believe there's a museum in Welwyn
Wilton Katz's FALSE FACE. 

I have a feeling museums play a role in woks by Kit Pearson (AWAKE AND
DREAMING? or the Guests of War trilogy?).
