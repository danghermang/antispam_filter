Bit harsh bearing in mind their goal was a push on the marker. U can bet if our player did that it would be ruled out.

Worst case scenario is that it's career ending.

2 points lost today, and very unnecessarily so.
This time, I'll blame RDM (after all, Luiz didn't play). After 1-0, we seemed to start to play very deep, and counter attack. But with the players on the pitch, we're not a counter-attacking side. With continued pressure, we could have, and should have, killed this game off long before the equalizer. Instead, we gifted the game to Liverpool. And the other thing was an amazing frequency of sloppiness when we DID get our chances. Is the team suffering, psychologically, from the fixture list? Is RDM suffering from how amazingly well the counter-attacking tactics worked last year in CL? Is RDM, after all, a one-trick pony?
