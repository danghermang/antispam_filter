Can we perhaps come up with something that can be used to teach computer
security to school children perhaps,  If I get this TA job it's
something that I would argue should be on the computer science curriculum. 

Is there a set of ideas that should be included in a module on keeping
safe on line,  tips tricks etc

e.g if you hover overf a link,  the bar at the bottom of th browser /
mail client will generally tell you the real place the link is going to,  

This isn't complex but how many people know about it,   it's little
things that make the difference.

Keeping safe is part of the curriculum anyway but it's important educate
parents,  so perhaps the exwick ark people can look in to helping us run
workshops on the topic,   aiming at pre-school parents would be an
excellent way of getting in before problems set in.

It would be something I can look in to to see if there IS a need,  and
if there IS,   perhaps as a group we can look in to helping draw
something up.
