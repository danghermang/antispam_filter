Assuming you actually mean 200 kWh (kilowatt hours => unit of energy), 
that's a LOT of battery. At 100 Wh/kg for LiFePO4, that would be 2000kg - 
4400lb - over 2 tons.  That's a heck of a lot to carry, even in a truck.

If you really mean 200 kW (unit of power), that's much less of a problem.

PS - please, folks, say what you mean, so that the rest of us aren't 
confused.  KW != kWh.  I know this seems a bit pedantic, but it does make a 
difference.
