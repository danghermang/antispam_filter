Wake the fuck up.  

The Forbes article makes my point:  they are reporting on the concern (like the concern of a number of you), not ill intent as was suggested by the original article.  They talk about the disappointingly bad choice and unfortunate conscience and saying that it was a bad idea to have any ties to any company having anything do with voting machines.  They clearly state that they don't suspect any form of voter fraud...  they make a big point of saying that specifically, several times.

I see that you have now posted the message you said you wrote last night but weren't going to post, but you sent to me privately, saying, "I didn't post this because it is insulting and I don't mean to be insulting," but now apparently you do.  First of all, saying "I don't mean to be insulting" and then being insulting (e.g., "wake the fuck up") is still insulting. Second, I will now paraphrase what I said to you privately.  Have you not read or heard anything about the Bush elections?  Are you wearing some kind of "It can't happen here" blinders?  I think your "wake the fuck up" to me is mis-aimed. I did not say ROMNEY IS DEFRAUDING VOTERS (although we have already seen the video of his supporters doing this with their registration drives), what I did say was it is important that any indication that Romney may be defrauding voters be investigated.  I don't think that is

Problem is that Hart Intercivic appears not to be publicly held so they seem not have any requirement for reporting their ownership.  In any case there is nothing readily available about it.  To me that's a problem because there is no way for the public to know about potential conflicts of interest.  The one thing that is visible on the Hart website is that 3 of 5 directors are from HIG Capital, which gives them control of the company.  The connections between HIG Capital and Bain are pretty clear, with one of the HIG Capital founders a former partner at Bain.  It's enough to raise questions that need to be addressed.

I put the "Let People Vote" bumper sticker on my car that the ACLU sent me, but when she said "like-minded people", she basically said she assumed other people on the list wouldn't see through this sort of Rush Limbaugh style making something out of nothing story and that we're equally gullible.  Not the case here.  In fact, I it disturbs me to think that some of the people I like (the like-minded people on this list) fall for this kind of bullshit and are encouraging other people to do the same.  "Wake the fuck up, it's just manipulative bullshit that happens to support your point of view..." is what I wanted to say.

She thinks she's doing a good thing, and bless her for it, but the fact that she's been taken by this ruse makes me angry...  not at her, but at the people manipulating the simple minded people of this country.  If everyone wasn't so goddamn stupid and self interested, we might actually pull together and move into a new era of peace, prosperity, growth, and scientific breakthroughs.
