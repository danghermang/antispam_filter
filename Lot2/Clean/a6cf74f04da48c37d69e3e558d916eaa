Subject:Re: [EVDL] 3D modeling
Jukka,

That would be cool.  It would be nice to order in the exact size and "C"
rating you wanted.  One way I could see this working very well:

If a conversion shop specialized in a certain model of car, it would be
worth taking the time to get the packs set up just so.  Once modeled
carefully, assembly sequence clarified and system tried out on a car, it
would be easy to sell kits or converted vehicles from that plan and model.
