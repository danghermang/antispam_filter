I agree he didnt look too bad at preseason. Pity he had the injury. A few 
weeks ago I saw him play one half for the reserves and he was quite bad. I 
think he also played some minutes against Wolves in the League Cup and 
didnt play well there either. I dont know whether it is his fitness, 
skills or attitude (well, probably fitness ;), but he from those games 
must improve significantly to start games. 

Some percentage of signings always fail and Haza and Oscar have been 
successes, so based on probabilities I guess Marin has to be a failure ;)

So: good luck to Marin - hope to see him soon!
