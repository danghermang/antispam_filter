Subject:[EVDL] Rolling Resistance: wide vs skinny

Hi Folk's,
 
Based on what I've googled, I think I'll change my 165 80 15's on my www.evalbum.com/4346 to wider Prius LRR tires 185 65 15's or 195 65 15's (if the 195's won't rub the rear fenders on a 74' Ghia.  It's counter intuitive but it looks like *wider* tires pressurized to the *same* psi have *lower* rolling resistance than skinnier tires due to the longitudnal contact patch/deflection.
 
Thanks Bruce for all the great LRR info, now I know enough to be dangerous :-)
 
Have a renewable energy day,

>From gassavers.com:
It is commonly thought that narrower tires have less rolling resistance and a smaller contact patch. This is not entirely true. They do offer weight and aerodynamic advantages, though.

Given that everything else is equal (construction, materials, tread pattern, air pressure), the wider tire will have LESS rolling resistance. Rolling resistance comes mainly from sidewall deformation -- look at where the tire meets the road, it's partially flattened instead of perfectly round, and the sidewall bulges to make that happen.

Some people are concerned about flex in the tread blocks causing RR; comparing most car tires, tread squirm should not make much difference in RR, though for knobby off-road truck tires compared to normal road tires the difference would be large. Perhaps even particularly aggressive treads on high performance road tires could have a little extra RR, but I doubt it would be much.

Now, on to why wider tires have less RR. The contact patch size is determined by the weight on the tire and the pressure in it. At 50psi (pounds per square inch) with a 500 pound load, that's a 10 square inch contact patch. If that tire is 5 inches wide, it will have a 2 inch long contact patch -- so only 2 inches of sidewall must deform. If the tire is 2 inches wide, it will have a 5 inch long contact patch -- so 5 inches of sidewall must deform. The narrower tire in that extreme example will have far more RR.

How and why did I learn this? I was an avid member of rec.bicycles.tech and a bicyclist with tired, achy legs. When it's your own legs, sweat, and pain on the line, it becomes much more important to really understand and reduce losses than when it's just fuel economy. There's some very knowledgable folks on that newsgroup who have done the in-depth scientific research about things like this. On a bicycle the narrower tire is usually rated for higher pressure, so it ends up with equal or better RR anyway. On a car, that's not usually the case.

The other advantage for wider tires is better cornering, so you can carry more of your momentum through the corner.
Best Regards,
Mark
