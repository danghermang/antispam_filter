Thanks Luke!

45 Minutes after someone gets them at Hammo (Madison), we'll check for them at the mouth of Morris Creek (ie, Lighthouse Park, New Haven).

Hi All,

I'm still on the listserve for Genesee which is the local list for Braddock Bay on Lake Ontario NY. It looks like the last few days have brought them decent numbers of Cave Swallows - they have to go somewhere right? http://birding.aba.org/maillist/NY04
