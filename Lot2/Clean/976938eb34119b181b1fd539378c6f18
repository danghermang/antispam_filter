Rudine Sims Bishop has written about this in her book Free within Ourselves: The Development of African American Children's Literature. Definitely worth a read.

Subject: [child_lit] An African-American friend...; Black canon query

Catherine asked a question that no one has responded to yet, and it's one
I'd LOVE to know the answer to:

"Is there, in fact, a black American canon that tends not to get
acknowledged in the white-dominated media?"

IS THERE?
I admit I am kind of excited at the thought that perhaps there is some kind
of substantial black canon of children's literature that has been under the
radar of white, and educated-by-whites, me. Even if such a thing doesn't
exist on the scale I'm imagining, are there texts that are considered
canonical for black child/YA readers but are not (yet?) part of the
"mainstream" - i.e., white - canon?
