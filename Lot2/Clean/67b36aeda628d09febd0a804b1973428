Subject:Re: [Birding-Aus] Rainbow Lorikeet bullies Magpie
As a boy I kept parrots and size does not matter - nothing stands up to a rainbow in a mixed collection that I've seen yet - rosellas are territorial, pugnacious, bossy and will bite each others toes off through wire in adjacent cages, but no match for and give way to rainbows.

The magpie incident is interesting, as I haven't seen rainbows and magpies interact, but I'm not surprised......

Rainbow lorrikeet lands, strides purposefully across table, like a slightly drunken sailor in search of more whisky - HEADBUTTS Magpie straight in the breastbone - magpie falls appx 4 ft to the ground....picks self up in a 'yes sir, anything you say sir' kind of way, and continues to peck about on the ground...lorrikeet takes charge of entirety of table.  no ifs, buts or maybes

I know rainbow lorrikeets are ratbags but am unaccustomed to the concept of a magpie taking second place under any circumstance (have known a friend's cat to hide from magpies, after catching one....and copping the ire of its relatives ever after).  Have you seen such a thing?
