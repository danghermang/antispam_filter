Does this mean that you will publish a ROLE object in the bulk dump
once it is referenced from an abuse-c: field?

Right now, you're redacting ROLE objects=E2=80=94but as Kaveh said, ROLE
objects should not contain personal data, so there shouldn't be a
reason for redacting them.  That's where my confusion comes from, I
guess.
