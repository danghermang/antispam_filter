I modified the package in backports to not compress the *.js files:

underscore (1.1.6-1~bpo60+1) squeeze-backports; urgency=low

  * Rebuild for squeeze-backports.
  * Include uncompressed version of *.js to avoid a build-dependency on
    uglifyjs.

You probably try to get the build-dependencies for a different version
here.
