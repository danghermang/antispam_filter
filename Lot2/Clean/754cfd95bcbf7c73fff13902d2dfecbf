Subject:Re: [EVDL] how do I drive my EV?
If you get an inductive proximity sensor (I just looked and they are $3 on
Ebay) make sure to get one with a little led light on it.  This makes it
really easy to see that it is working correctly.  Here is the one I used
that has a 4mm sensing distance (more than most) and has worked flawlessly.

Your efficiency gains might possibly be attributable to other things (you
mention some battery bugs).  You can find out by using 2nd.  If your
efficiency goes back down, then it is likely better to start in first.  It
may be situation dependent with the equation being efficiency vs.
convenience.  How hard is it to shift from 1st-2nd?
