Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Take-off angle
Oliver

With the antenna several wavelengths high you can change the angle of
the beam by tilting the antenna upwards or downwards.  Most people use
horizontally polarised beams and I assume yours is horizontally
polarised.

But most people have their beam antenna nearer the ground, and then
the takeoff angle is above zero even when the beam is pointed
horizontally.

In that case the takeoff angle is controlled by the height of the
antenna, and a height of at least a quarter wavelength and preferably
a half wavelength is best.

A full wave loop has a beam that in free space goes along the axis of
the loop in both directions, which is not the best option when the
loop is horizontal (i.e. in the horizontal plane with the axis
vertical) above ground.  In that case most of the radiation goes at
high angles.  If a horizontal full wave loop is half a wavelength
high, no radiation goes vertically, but the takeoff angle is still
well above zero.

A vertical fullwave loop (as in half a cubical-quad) works well and,
but it is bi-directional, and if it's half a wavelength high it sends
the radiation at a reasonably low angle.
