o Possible Phyllosilicate Near Margaritifer Chaos

  The existence of clay minerals is especially interesting on Mars 
  since we want to know under what conditions these minerals formed. 
  Could it have been the presence of water?

o Chutes and Flows

  Some of the surface material appears to have breached the crater rim 
  and flowed into the crater by way of chutes.

o A Streamlined Island in Athabasca Valles

  Streamlined islands form by a rapid erosive flow (catastrophic flooding) 
  around an obstacle such as a resistant rock outcrop or surface armored 
  by impact ejecta.

o Only on Mars

  The South Polar terrain of Mars has a landscape unlike anywhere on Earth.
