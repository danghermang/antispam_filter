Subject:[Hsqldb-user] Re g: Text field  in postgres to varchar in hsqldb

Hi,
I have a table in Postgres which I am moving to hsqldb. I have a text field
in that table. I changed its type to varchar in hsqldb.
But that particular field can range from 0 to 3 to 30 to even 50,000. 
I put the field as varchar (50000) but a lot of memory is wasted because of
this. 
Is there a way to get through this with less memory wastage?

thanks in advance,
-sandeep.
