This is the reason for checking out various distros via VBox. I realise
that I need to move on from Maverick as soon as. By the way I never go
via upgrades, I always completely install any new distro from scratch.

I am beginning to feel that I won't bother, I will just choose whichever
distro to go for and install it.

I have looked at VMware in the past and did not get on with it, probably
because I am so used to VBox.

Agreed.

I have never tried Debian. My usual distros are Mint KDE or Kubuntu. I
have also used Mint Xfce and Xubuntu on laptops.

I have looked at Cinnamon, again via VBox, and did not like it. And I
hate Gnome with a passion. So whichever distro I end up with will use
KDE or possibly Xfce.

I will do some research on Debian Testing but the work 'Testing' worries me.

As I said, I don't do upgrades.

So, even more urgent than I realised!!

Thank you for taking the time to give me all this help and information.
I really do appreciate it.
