Chapter Elections & Topics for 2013

Saturday, Nov 17, 2012

Meeting Location: Rhythmix Cultural Works, 2513 Blanding Ave, Alameda, CA 
Visitors welcome, open to the public.

The 2012 year is winding down. This is our last monthly meeting of the year.

Earlier this month we voted on local, state & national issues. Now is the time for selecting our Chapter leadership for 2013. This meeting is our chance to unwind and reflect on what we've covered and what topics we'd like to focus on for the next year. Refreshments provided.

Besides holding our usual election / selection of Chapter leadership for 2013, we also are going to reflect on what has been accomplished during the year in the development of EVs and batteries. Come join us to share what topics you'd like to see us cover in this new year. 

EVs will be in the parking lot after the meeting.
