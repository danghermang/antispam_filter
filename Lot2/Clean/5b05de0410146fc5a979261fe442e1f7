Subject:Re: [Chelsea] The slow motion videos of referee Mark Clattenburg's
 confrontations with Chelsea's John Obi Mikel & Juan Mata [101GG]
The author seems to have forgotten how these cases are judged and the precedent set. It doesn't have to be proved, it's a matter of probability, with a lower burden of proof. 
It doesn't matter that people close by didn't hear the slurs, AF didn't. So that's moot.
