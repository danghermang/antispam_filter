Subject:Re: [CT Birds] Audubon's Warbler
The AUDUBON'S Warbler just took off and flew high and away to the north, till out of view. It flew in the direction of the corner of Access Rd. and Rt 113, near Access Pond.
Perhaps the McKinney NWR RR trail would be a good place to search.

He noted bright yellow throat and it lacks a pale supercilium. It is in the dune shrubbery along the right edge of the parking lot about 75 yards down from the entrance booth. He'll try to obtain photos.
