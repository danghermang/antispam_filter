Subject:[Chelsea] Local fans
We were massively outnumbered by local Chelsea fans in our section. I got to the airport 5 mins ahead of the team coach and there were about 30 locals insisting on having their photos taken with the players, who were patient but not looking like happy bunnies
Other than that flurry of excitement there's very little going on at the enormous Sergei Prokoffiev International Airport at 2 in the morning
