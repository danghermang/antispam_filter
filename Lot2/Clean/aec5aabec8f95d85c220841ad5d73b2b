I have an electric chainsaw, and it happens to have a universal (series) 
motor. I have no idea what the various makes/models use (and their 
marketing is mute on the subject).

It arcs both times, but it's the arc on opening that lasts long enough 
to do the damage.

If you can see the switch contact, you'll observe that the arcing is 
*drastically* worse on DC than on AC. It's obviously going to 
significantly shorten the life of the switch.

The big unknown is -- how much life and safety factor was designed into 
the switch in the first place? You might have an el-crappo switch that 
will barely last 100 cycles even on AC. Shorten its life by 10:1 on DC, 
and it will fail very soon!

Or, you might have a "heavy duty" switch, with snap-acting contacts and 
a 250vac rating for double the current it's actually switching. That 
switch might last 10,000 on/off cycles on AC, and will *still* last 1000 
cycles on DC -- that may be good enough to "get by".

My view: It's next to impossible to get parts for products today, so if 
the switch fails, you'll have a heck of a time finding a replacement. So 
it's better NOT to use it to switch DC directly -- rewire the switch to 
operate a relay that *is* rated for the DC voltage and current you will 
be using.

Indeed. Farming is a dangerous occupation, because they often *don't* 
worry about safety in the interests of getting things done.
