Subject:Re: [MG] How Much Change Is Enough?
Hi Ned,

I was hoping to get a rough sense of what you're proposing without
reading all the details.

Earlier you said:

I eventually found this page, which I read:
http://www.wiser.org/article/a1ad51d14fa5214ca243a64490e590b6

I see your proposal is based on a game.  Starting from there, can you
summarize the whole proposal in a sentence or two?

Mike
