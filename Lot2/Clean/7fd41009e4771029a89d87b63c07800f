Subject:[Jukebox-list] 6973 to el84 info needed.
Howdy, =20
  I'm getting close to finishing my ami continental 2.  I have all the tube=
s except the 6973s.  I have a pile of el84 tubes and have read I can use th=
ese as a sub.  I am ok with rewiring the sockets and I also understand I ne=
ed to change a resistor per socket.  According to the schematic this resist=
or is currently 470k and they are reading at 550k.
  Is there any info out there on what needs to be done for this conversion.=
  Any one know what value resistor I need to change to.
Thanks
Ed=
