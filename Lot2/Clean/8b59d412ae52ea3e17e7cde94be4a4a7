Subject:Re: [EVDL] Advancing Motor Timing pros/cons/ accel efficiency
Advance me the necessary materials and one ultralight from
www.electraflyer.com and I can advance the timing of when you'll see
extended-range low-audible & low-infrared-heat-emissions electric motorized
aircraft ........ under all except closely scrutinized doppler-type radar,
I presume . . . . . . . . .
