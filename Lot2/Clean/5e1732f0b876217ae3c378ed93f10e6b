Hi Mark -

I really don't have time for too much of this stuff. I would be very
happy if you would post this on the list! There is also a great clip
of Rex playing on the dance scene in Hell's a Poppin! Check it out !

Regards -

Rich

Goodness, Richard!
Why haven't you sent this to the list?
I've seen this clip quite a few times before, and have the LP as well.
 It features a lot of my all-time favourites.
My reply was to a specific statement, so I just mentioned two of my
favourite trumpet players.  I could have mentioned more, but I
preferred to refrain from mentioning such swing players like Buck
Clayton or Harry Edison.
I do not underestimate Bix, on the contrary - but still have to hear a
good CD remastering, with the "like a girl saying yes" sound, which
comes through on LP and tapes.
Only yesterday I listened to two Rex Stewart LPs, on on of which he
plays Petit Fleur with just teh rhythm section!
Best wishes
