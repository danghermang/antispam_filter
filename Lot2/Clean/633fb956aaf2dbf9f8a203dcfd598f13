Trip Details.

In 2012, the annual Kimberley Birdwatching's (KBW) eight-day Broome-Ashmore-Lacepedes-Broome expedition ran from 20-27 October. Logistics and permits were organised by George Swann of KBW. Personnel were Jim Allen, David Bullock, Chris Evans, Lizzie Fabregues, David Hair, John Lillywhite, Fran Standing, Jim Standing, Pam Smith, Mark Swann, Paul Taylor, Allan Volger, John Weigel, Rohan Clarke, George Swann & Mike Carter. Our boat was the air-conditioned 21 m MV Flying Fish V skippered by George Greaves. Jacqui fed and nurtured us and Maurice O'Connor assisted in numerous ways.  

            We sailed from the beach near Gantheaume Point in Broome on 20 October (Day 1) at 08.00 and spent the next two days and nights travelling at sea. We maintained a NW course throughout Day 1 but at night changed our heading to NNE. By dawn on Day 2 we were in waters reaching depths of 400 m or greater and cruised along the continental slope throughout the morning venturing into almost 1,000 m deep water by dusk, passing just to the west of Scott Reef after dark. We awoke on Day 3 sailing northerly in water with a depth of 780 m and continued in that general direction until ~10.00 when we turned to the east heading directly to Ashmore Reef. At  ~12.00, after passing the Australian Customs Vessel 'Ashmore Guardian' with it's complement of federal government (DSEWPaC) wardens moored at the entrance, we entered the lagoon and berthed.

        For the next three nights (Days 3, 4 & 5), we were secure at the inner mooring just off West Island. Most members of the party went ashore on West Island at dawn each day and on two afternoons, ferried there by three dinghies. These were also used to transport us to Middle Island, where we did not land, an adjacent sand bar, and next day to East Island where we were able to land. Neap tides were a benefit in enabling access to all islands but were disadvantageous in that shorebirds did not concentrate at high-tide roosts and that we had to wade to the shore of East Island.

        After a last visit ashore on West Island, we released our mooring at Ashmore at 09.00 on Day 6 (21 October) and sailed throughout the day on a SSW heading through waters of depths between 500-750 m. By dawn on Day 7, we were already over the shelf break on a direct course due south for the Lacepedes and were over shelf waters of mostly 50-60 m deep that day. We anchored off West Island, Lacepedes at 17.05. Next morning, Day 8 (23 October), we were ashore on West Island, Lacepedes, from 04.30 to 08.30. Back aboard and tenders stowed, we sailed for Broome, berthing at the wharf there at 17.00.

        Weather was mostly hot and humid with cloudless skies and therefore constant sunshine although it was hazy on the last two days and a brief downpour was experienced on our last night at Ashmore. Light winds and slight seas prevailed for most of the trip except on Day 1 when some found the conditions uncomfortable.  



        Observations will be posted in Report Part 2.
