Had AVB not been sacked we'd never have turned the tie around v Napoli, the simple fact of his leaving galvanised the team in the same way as Vialli's appointment and Gullit's sacking galvanised us to beat Arsenal in that League Cup Semi-Final.

Not sure if RDM got the champagne out pre-match mind you!

A nice book to read would be "Fooled by Randomness" written by Nassim Taleb and then watch our CL campaign again. For me, we were very lucky to win it. Alex and Anelka did not win us the CL for a start, Drogba was always going to leave at the end of the season and how much longer is Lampard going to play? Already he is no longer guaranteed a start. 


No, Anelka didn't win us the CL. But, I think that with him in the squad last year, instead of the hapless FFT, we would not have been worse off in that particular season.

Yes, I believe there was luck involved in our CL win. I think there is always luck involved in cup tournaments, and in leagues also, albeit to a much lesser extent. Football in not deterministic, even though AVB sometimes gives the impression that he thinks it is. That is one of his many faults, IMHO; he overestimates the extent to which he can control games with his self-professed tactical shrewdness. Lack of humility is, however, something that is sometimes overcome with age and experience, and AVB is, after all, very young. 

In spite of the luck we had in the CL, had AVB stayed I am pretty convinced that we would not have been so lucky - we would not have won the CL. And that statement alone tells you that I think there is some causality involved also, i.e. it's not only luck. Robbie managed to get the players (including the dead wood) to perform at their highest standard, and to show a fantastic determination (individually and as a group), and to thereby set themselves up for a position where, with a bit of luck, they might just win the CL, as long as they believed they could. That, again IMHO, is a much better measure of a manager than what signings that are made. As you said, it is not obvious exactly who controls the transfer policy, neither for us nor for Spurs. In the end, it should be the one who pays who has the final say, in our case Roman.
