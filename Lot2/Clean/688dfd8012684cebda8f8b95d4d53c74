Yes, we do block China domains and have for years. We blocked 2 more =

just today. But, some take investigation to determine their country of =

origin. We don't sell to them either.

For all domain web and mail ending in ".cn" are blocked. However, they =

are sneaky.

Actually, Romania is a good customer. We selectively sell to those =

with callsigns.

Fortunately we are in 217 countries and in many cases we don't have =

trouble selecting assistance in every country. China would be an =

exception tho.

Even Bill Gates can't stop their piracy of products. Only about 10% of =

Windows over there are legit.

Thanks again Mike, for the suggestions.....
