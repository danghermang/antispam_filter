I don't know if this is of use but I recall I had problems some time ago trying to install DBD::mysql when I tried to upgrade
ActivePerl to 5.8 on my Mac as this module wasn't available. I eventually solved this by installing the DBD::mysqlPP module instead
and that worked OK with my MySQL code.

I did have a problem though when I was trying to remotely debug with Perl 5.8 some CGI scripts that used MySQL with the original
DBD::mysql module, and I had to adjust the code so that it installed whichever DBD driver was available.
