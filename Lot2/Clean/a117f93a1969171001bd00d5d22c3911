Cool,  I think in this context its' probably Pi's but anyway i am sure
we can come up with some ideas,  if you can set them up so we can
connect a network cable and perhaps ssh into them (needs ssh server
running on the pi)  we can remote login,   i am sure someone on the list
can provide some guidance on this :)  Anyone ?
