Subject:Re: [child_lit] NY/NJ Child_lit folks
I live in Inwood, which has been fine--we had flickers and internet
outages, but very briefly. But I've been working at home all week because
the Lee & Low office, which is at 28th St. & Madison, is affected by the
huge power outage in lower Manhattan. I feel very blessed that this is the
only problem I've encountered--I know one editor who was stranded in their
Hoboken home, and have several coworkers who have been without power all
week.

By the way, I didn't originally share my writing contest with Child_Lit
because I know most of you are not writers, but given the storm I hope that
those of you who do have networks that include writers might pass this news
on:

Due to Sandy, we have extended the deadline for our New Visions Award
writing contest, which is Tu Books' companion award to Lee & Low's New
Voices contest. For more information, here's our blog post on the
extension:
http://blog.leeandlow.com/2012/10/31/hurricane-update-new-visions-award-deadline-extension/,
with a link on that page to the original submission guidelines. The New
Visions Award will be given for a middle grade or young adult fantasy,
science fiction, or mystery novel by a writer of color. The new deadline is
now Nov. 14.

Please share this news with your social networks, English and writing
departments, etc.--wherever such news might be welcome.

Best,
Stacy Whitman
Editorial Director
