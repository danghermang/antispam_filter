Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Wurlitzer 1500 and 1550 decal set
Victor -

I hope you *do *get lucky and have no major issues with your 1500. There
were many mechanical flaws in that model  -- one of which was having 2
trays come out at once and then the tonearm rises and the torque from the
motor crunches your records, not to mention jam the mech -- ugh! The manual
is awful and although complete does not address any of the constant
adjustments that need to be done. There is no link from one adjustment to
another to connect the dots, so you end up fixing one problem and 2 others
rear their ugly head.  I have heard from people in Europe who have restored
this model that once all the bugs are out of them they are reliable and
work fine. That may be true, but trying to rid this beast of its
engineering bugs is a challenge to put it mildly. I am about 90% complete
with my W1500A (see video) -- I am now in the process of machining new
parts to remedy an engineering defect in manufacturing, so we have gotten
into the "belly of the beast" so to speak and are now taking matters into
our own hands by building new parts to offset these defects. We'll see if
it works...
Aside from all this, the machine is beautiful when lit and will light up a
large room with its presence.
Sound quality is excellent for a 1-channel mono amp with a single 15"
dynamic range speaker but it is not even close to being equal to the
Seeburgs at that time. No contest. Wurlitzer might have won the selection
war with 104 selections over Seeburg's 100 but it came at a cost to
Wurlitzer, and I'm sure one series of models they'd prefer to forget...
