Continuing Work With Scoops at 'Rocknest'
Jet Propulsion Laboratory
October 29, 2012

NASA's Mars Rover Curiosity on Sol 82 (Oct. 29, 2012) used its Mars Hand
Lens Imager (MAHLI) to photograph the diverse rocks in the "Rocknest"
area and prepared for an overnight analysis of a soil sample by the
Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument.

On the preceding sol, the rover completed its third round of using
vibration of scooped Martian soil to scrub the interior surfaces of the
sample-processing mechanisms on the rover's arm. Also on Sol 81, the
rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument completed an analysis
of a sample of Martian atmosphere.

The rover continues regular monitoring of the surrounding environment
using the other instruments of its science payload.

Sol 82, in Mars local mean solar time at Gale Crater, ended at 1:35 p.m.
Oct. 29, PDT (4:35 p.m., EDT).
