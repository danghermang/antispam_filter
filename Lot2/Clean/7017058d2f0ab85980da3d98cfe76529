Subject:Re: [EVDL] Ceramic Heater elements
Scott,

I am currently putting in some heater elements in my Spitfire EV heater
box.  To solve the problem you could either cut off 2/5ths of heater
material of two separate typical elements.  Or get a space heater like
mine, which has two smaller elements.  Check it out:

Just yesterday I pulled apart my heater box and set them in for a dry fit.
 They fit perfectly.  By looking at the switches I can tell that they wired
up half of each element for "low" and both halves of each element for high.
 That should work just fine.  I also salvaged some things that look like
thermal fuses for some extra safety.

I really only need my defrost to work down here in LA.  I've put it off for
years but I'm finally going to do it!  I'm tired of carrying a rag to wipe
off the windshield so I can see.

-D
