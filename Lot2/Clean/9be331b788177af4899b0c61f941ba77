Subject:Re: [Dixielandjazz] Should "Live" bands use the same musicians
Oh, that there were both the discriminating public, and the extremely capab=
le musicians, that another Jelly Roll Morton could get bookings for a disap=
pointingly bad not exactly ensemble, by hiring Luis Russell's band during o=
ne of their breaks, and impressing bookers later to be dischuffed by the Ro=
se rather than Red non-Allen trumpeter and a more normally unsinging Jay on=
 trombone, et cetera ...=A0 According to Red Allen talking decades ago on t=
he BBC Jelly was much given to alternating the borrowed master-band to get =
bookings for men who couldn't command much by way of fees. =



Almost like a disbelief in live music. =


But who these days can afford to give themselves a bad name? =


Who doesn't give a damn if they're not asked back? =



Then there was the famous non-OKOM non-jazz Scottish group who not only use=
d the same musicians, they performed on-stage to dubs of the same backing-t=
racks played through the speakers=A0

alas without the potential delight of being caught miming to a disc with a =
jump groove =
