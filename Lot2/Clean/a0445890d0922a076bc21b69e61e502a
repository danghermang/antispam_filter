Subject:[EVDL] Best EV Tires

Hi Folk's,
I was curious about my www.evalbum.com/4346 74' Ghia going from the standard 165/80R15's 25.4" diam (only by 1 manufacturer not LRR) to about 1" wider Prius LRR tires either gen-2 185 65/15's 24.5"diam or Gen-3 195 65/15's (better 25.0" for speedo).  I pump my 165mm wide 35 psi tires to 45psi so if I buy new 5.5" rims & Prius tires, say 195mm (assuming they won't rub rear fenders) I wonder if that would improve my watt hours per mile? (presently 300 whr per mile at wall outlet).
Does anyone have any measured data (like Wh per mile or MPG) on wider vs skinny tires on LRR and going from a non LRR tire to a LRR tire and how to measure the LRR-ness of a tire?  TireRack etc just shows LRR not a percentage or number to compare from tire to tire.
Have a renewable energy day,markwww.REEVA.info
