Subject:[h-cost] machine embroidery

Fran asked:
how well *does* a good embroidery machine imitate blackwork?  Are the
results fairly plausible as long as it is not under the eye of a stitch
counter?

I never have the slightest trouble distinguishing machine from hand
embroidery. I suppose from 20 feet it might fool someone. . .
