The poor efficiency of rod antennas might come from the low value of
radiation resistance rather than because they are mass-produced, cheap
and nasty.  Alan P. quoted a typical radiation resistance of 1
microhm, and if the loss resistance is 1 ohm there is immediately a 60
dB loss there.

If the radiation resistance is the only resistance and a matched load
is connected, the capture area of the antenna follows the formula,
3.lambda^2/(8pi).  With a loss resistance of 1 ohm, then maximum power
is transferred when the load is also 1 ohm, and there is a 60 dB loss,
in other words the capture area is 60 dB less.

There is an interesting connection between the capture area and the
effective length, which comes from considering a lossless antenna.
The power available from the antenna is given in terms of the capture
are and the power density of the incident wave:

P = 3.lambda^2 / 8pi * E^2/zo, where zo is the free-space wave impedance;

The power can also be written in terms of the open-circuit voltage and
radiation resistance:

P = V^2 / 4Rr

Combining these two equations leads to the interesting result that for
any small antenna the radiation resistance can be written in terms of
the effective length Le, defined by the equation V = Le.E:

Rr = 789(Le/lambda)^2

and by using the induction law V = wNBA this formula can be adapted to
give the radiation resistance for an N-turn small loop antenna:

Rr = 20.N^2.k^4.A^2.

So both these formulas can be deduced from simple considerations.
