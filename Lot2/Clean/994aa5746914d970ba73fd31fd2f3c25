Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] Ferrite Antennas
Kirk

Just look at the two cases I calculated and you will see the presence
of the ferrite increases the power extracted by a large factor.  It's
fairly obvious, if you don't believe it, try an experiment, if you
don't want to do that, look at any transistor radio :).  But please do
anything rather than just sit there and argue, it's merely destructive
:).

I understand you are new to noise in radio systems so this is a
situation where you can learn something instead of arguing :).  In the
situation we are discussing we must concentrate only on noise in the
receiver, the incoming noise from outside the receiver is a good 40 dB
less than the incoming signal so can be neglected, you are off on a
completely wrong tangent there.  This is AM broadcast, not a
communications system and the noise calcuation is completely
different.
