Subject:[Flexradio] Flex Radio on MAC
I have run a Flex 1500 on a MacBook Pro using Parallels. It worked fine. I
had 8gb RAM and devoted 4 to the Parallels windows.

 

I have run the 1500 on an HP Envy notebook using Windows 8 Pro. It works
fine. I also run HRD and VAC and vspmgr and minideluxe. Last time I had it
going, I had QSOs with Belgium, France and England from the Oregon coast.
