Subject:[CT Birds] LPP Friday final
From Dana Campbell:
10/26 - New Haven, Lighthouse Point Park Hawkwatch - 55 migrating raptors
on very little wind including:  1 Juvenile GOLDEN EAGLE, 2 Bald Eagles, 23
Turkey Vultures, 2 Merlins, 5 sprey, 2 Northern Harriers, 5 Sharp-shinned
Hawks, 5 Cooper's Hawks, 1 Red-shouldered Hawk, 5 Red-tailed Hawks, 2
Unidentified Raptors, and 1 Juvenile NORTHERN GOSHAWK.

Also seen leaving town:  3000+ Common Grackles, and hundreds each of Cedar
Waxwings, Canada Geese, American Robins, Red-winged Blackbirds,
Brown-headed Cowbirds, and American Crows.  Also, 2 RUSTY BLACKBIRDS, 4
Common Loons, 2 American Pipits, 60 Black-capped Chickadees, and 20
Swallows (presumably all Tree Swallows, best I could tell.)

At one point a flock of 100+ crows rose up and suddenly two Red-tailed
Hawks high-tailed it out of the park.  Nothing like a little encouragement
to move.
