Subject:[CT Birds] Weekend in New Hampshire
Spent the 2-4th up in Ossipee New Hampshire, at Calumet Lutheran on Lake Os=
sipee.=A0 As I always go up to the area the first weekend in November,I hav=
e a long list of past birding species and numbers. Most years the Red Breas=
ted and White Breasted nuthatches are in fairly small numbers, similar to w=
hat I see up there in the summer.=A0 This year the numbers of Red Breasts a=
re probably triple from most years and the Whites are almost non existant.=
=A0 Noticed the pine cone and acorn=A0amounts were much smaller than normal=
, and that the number of red squirrels was also down.=A0 Also saw a huge fl=
ock of cedar waxwings, on Saturday morning and again right before leaving o=
n Sunday afternoon.=A0 Had a long hike up the Kancamagus, at a spot called =
Boulder Loop.=A0 Cones and acorns were just as scarce there, and other than=
 a raven and few blue jays, there were absolutely no other birds around.=A0=
 The man leading the hike said they had large flocks of siskins at the
 Conferance Center feeders back in early to mid October, but they haven't s=
een any in two weeks.=A0=A0 Also had a lone adult Loon in the cove on Sunda=
y morning.=A0 Usually only the young ones are around at this time of the ye=
ar, so it was great to see him/her.
