Subject:Re: [child_lit] An African-American friend asks who read what?

I wasn't exposed to the standard canon until I was in my 50s when I took a Children's Literature class at the University of British Columbia. Most of the students were in their twenties and almost all of them had read the 'standard' books that the instructor went through in the first class. I had read Wind in the Willows and the Alice books. My early childhood reading was limited by the lack of a library and a lack of money to buy books. We had a small school library nearby that was open once a week and I read books that looked interesting, usually not titles aimed at children or adolescents. Even in University in the mid 70s there was no such thing as a course in children's literature. Tolkien and Vonnegut were big in my teens and perhaps like Benjamin Button or Liz Hall in Elsewhere, discovering the literature of childhood as I move towards the latter half of my life.
