Subject:Re: [child_lit] Penguin and Random House merge
All eyes are on HarperCollins (Newscorp), S&S (Viacom), Hachette, and Von Holzbrinck.  There's probably another merger in the making.  I wouldn't be surprised if Google or Apple made a play.  Would Houghton follow Pearson's lead and peel off its trade publishing from its educational concerns?  How long before someone makes Richard Robinson an offer for Scholastic that he can't refuse?  This is probably the opening round of a major reshaping of the book industry.
