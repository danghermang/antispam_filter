Subject:Re: [EVDL] Calb battery issue
It is already built-in most vehicles and it is called AirCo.

We are back about 15 years, when the EV1 with NiMH batteries
had cooling problems and thus the GM engineers decided to
run the car's airco during charging - one of the reasons that
you will see a severely skewed charging efficiency for the
EV1 with NiMH batteries....

Getting off topic a bit but surely the heat pump is the best solution.  Eg http://www.visteon.com/products/automotive/heat_pump_system.html

... but I'm guessing nothing available yet that is remotely affordable, sadly.
