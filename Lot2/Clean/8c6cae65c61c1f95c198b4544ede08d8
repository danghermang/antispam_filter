Subject:[LUG] Unstable Ubuntu 12.04 ?
Hi All, 

Has anyone experienced an unstable mouse driver 
in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ?

Problem is the mouse darts all over 
the screen, clicking icons at random. 
The only way I have 
found to fix it is to hold the power button down 
to force 
a hardware shutoff, then restart with a cold boot. 

Your 
input would be most welcome. 

Regards etc,
Ray.
