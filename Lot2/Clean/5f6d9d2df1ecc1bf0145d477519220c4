Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Seeburg Rex motor overheating?
Hi John,

Thanks for your response.

There is more drag during the changing cycle, but it doesn't seem excessive. Most of the time the motor is just spinning the turntable, and there's little resistance while it's doing that.

The motor outside casing is not anywhere near 100C, but it gets hot enough to the touch to be uncomfortable to leave your hand on it. I'm not sure if the smell when it gets hot is normal, the insulation is 75 years old, but it concerns me that it might be getting hot enough to result in failure sooner rather than later.

Bill
