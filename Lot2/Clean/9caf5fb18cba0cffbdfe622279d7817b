Subject:[CT Birds] Waterford Yard Birds: Siskins etc
After being away most of this month it was nice to get home to a flock of Pine Siskins this morn, 2 RB Nuthatches, 1 YR Warbler, WT Sparrows on the ground, and my RB Woodpeckers who turned out to be very intimidated by this feisty flock of Siskins. 

No ducks showing up in the Niantic River yet.
