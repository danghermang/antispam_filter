Subject:[meteorite-list] Any New Novato Finds?
I'm curious if there are any new finds from Novato this week?
Sites/emails seem quite on finds at the moment...was there yesterday
to visit my Mom, but, ended up taking her to the Er for wound care on
her leg(She'll be OK), and, hunting was delayed.
Ty
Happy Hunting!
Cal
