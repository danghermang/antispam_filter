I hope it's readable in your mail reader.  Just in case, if anyone has
trouble reading the diagram, please see the list archive:

This is diagram (1), same as last time:

Okay, sounds good.  So let's assume that both T1 and T2 are compliant
plug-ins (i.e compliant with S).  This means the user can easily
switch back and forth.  This is the ideal, I agree.

Now suppose T1 and T2 are voting tools.  There are different kinds of
tools, of course, each with its own competing instances.  But I want
to look specifically at voting tools.  I see that voting is part of
the model under the category of "assessment", if I understand.

(I opened a separate thread to discuss model details)

Suppose further that these two voting tools (T1 and T2) are designed
to reveal and express the shape of opinion (M) as it forms.  Whenever
a user wants to know the general pattern of consensus and dissensus,
or related details, he/she can pick up his favourite voting tool (say
T2) and read the information from it.

How do you feel about this?  Are you comfortable with voting being
used for this purpose?  (Myself, I feel it's very important to reveal
the shape of opinion as it emerges.  And I think active, continuous
voting is generally the best approach for this.)

How do others in the group feel?  I wish I could ask my question in
German, because I'm interested in hearing the views of anyone who
wants to speak.
