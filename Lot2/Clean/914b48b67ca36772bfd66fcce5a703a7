Subject:[child_lit] HIT: Main Characters with Learning Problems (all levels)
Hi Everyone!

Thank you all so much for your suggestions of book titles. I received quite
a mix of 'learning problems'. The list is quite long so i posted it on my
blog (link below).

I figure that would be easiest for everyone to read/save. I was looking for
books with main characters that have learning problems/disabilities.
If anyone can think of other titles that has a main character with learning
difficulties such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, etc., please let me
know, I'd love to add them to the list.

Thank you all again!
Michelle
