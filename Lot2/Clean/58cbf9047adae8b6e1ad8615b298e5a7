Which can be tested on https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm bearing in mind 
the times given are for all possibilities to be tested.  I would suggest 
one basic password for websites, but append two or three letters to the 
end denoting what the site is, e.g. Ju1i@nH@11 with Ama (Amazon), O2 
(obvious :)), Anc (Ancestry.co.uk) etc on the end.  As long as you 
remember the root password you're still (relatively) secure from someone 
who gets access to one of the websites databases.

Have two as none of them are 100% accurate and they may cover each 
other's gaps.  Not two that use the same engine or database of course :)

Nicking the strap line from the PC game Wing Commander 'The price of 
freedom is eternal vigilance', which they probably pinched from 
somewhere else :)  The best form of defence is knowing what you're doing 
and being vigilante.

Unless as I pointed out your NAT router is supplied by your ISP and they 
keep changing the firmware without your permission, which as it's their 
property they're allowed to do, but leaves you open to the possibility 
they screwed up and made you vulnerable to attack.
