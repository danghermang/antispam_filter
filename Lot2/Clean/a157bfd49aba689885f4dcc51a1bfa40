Subject:Re: [EVDL] 3D modeling
World is changing maybe faster than expected :)

I've seen this done with a standard webcam.

Also this seems to be possible (not only in the vaporware regim)

I can see no reason why we could not calculate the data from a full HD
video. It will not take that much CPU power from the camera.

If it would be that easy already we all would be doing it. I'm looking
new ways to get this business evolve faster. Lot's of work to be done.

As you might already guess the next logical step is to build the
battery inside the pack with much less mechanics. We could cut the
cell exactly in the shape of the box and maximize the Wh/kg and Wh/l.
When integrating all in a factory it should be more efficient and
tamper free.
