Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Problem with high DPC count after upgrading to W8
 Pro
I have installed Windows 8 on a second internal had drive so that I can 
easily boot either WIn 7 or Win 8. I did a clean install on a 
reformatted hard drive and did not bring any files or applications 
forward from Win 7. I have now installed the full DXLab suite, PSDR 
2.4.4, CW Skimmer, DDUtil and PstRotatorAZ on Win 8 and nothing else so 
far. DPCs are about the same as they were on Win 7 with a maximum DPC of 
419 Us in the past hour. PSDR and my Flex-3000 are performing well. I am 
wondering if the folks who are having problems followed the upgrade path 
and brought everything forward from Win 7. That may be the difference.
