Subject:Re: [meteorite-list] NASA SETI Misappropriation of Tax Payer Funds
Greg,


If I could agree more than 100%, I would.

Some of the "blimp" reports claim the researchers are looking for likely ar=
eas to hunt.=A0 Crater or no, why can't they do this using Google Maps and =
Google Earth like the rest of us.

My second issue, is why is a private citizen being given a free ride.=A0 Wh=
at are this person's credentials that he can add scientific value or meteor=
ite hunting expertise?=A0 I want to go on the blimp - sounds like fun and a=
t least I know what one looks like.=A0 Even better why not reach out to the=
 professional meteorite hunters on this list who have shown success over ye=
ars of hunting in different countries, terrains and conditions and work tog=
ether towards a common goal.=A0 I'm willing to bet that 1 hour strategizing=
 with one of you pro hunters would pay off infinitely more than 1 month in =
a tax-payer waste of money blimp.

Finally, I have always been a strong supporter of NASA (National Aeronautic=
s and Space Administration). This sort of thing makes me reconsider that su=
pport, especially in TERRESTRIAL matters where they are not the experts.

Grrrrr ...

Mendy

a dime, a golf ball or even a basketball from an altitude of 1000 feet?
