Last Call: Publishing and Linking on the Web

   25 October 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9618

   The Technical Architecture Group has published a Last Call
   Working Draft of "Publishing and Linking on the Web."
   Publishing a page on the Web is fundamentally different from
   printing and distributing a page in a magazine or book. This
   document is intended to inform future social and legal
   discussions of the Web by clarifying the ways in which the
   Web's technical facilities operate to store, publish and
   retrieve information, and by providing definitions for
   terminology as used within the Web's technical community. This
   document also describes the technical and operational impact
   that does or could result from legal constraints on publishing,
   linking and transformation on the Web. Comments are welcome
   through 13 December. Learn more about the Technical
   Architecture Group.

File API Draft Published

   25 October 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9617

   The Web Applications Working Group has published a Working
   Draft of "File API." Web applications should have the ability
   to manipulate as wide as possible a range of user input,
   including files that a user may wish to upload to a remote
   server or manipulate inside a rich web application. This
   specification defines the basic representations for files,
   lists of files, errors raised by access to files, and
   programmatic ways to read files. Additionally, this
   specification also defines an interface that represents "raw
   data" which can be asynchronously processed on the main thread
   of conforming user agents. The interfaces and API defined in
   this specification can be used with other interfaces and APIs
   exposed to the Open Web Platform. Learn more about the Rich Web
   Client Activity.

Filter Effects 1.0 Draft Published

   25 October 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9616

   The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group has published
   the First Public Working Draft of "Filter Effects 1.0." Filter
   effects are a way of processing an element's rendering before
   it is displayed in the document. Typically, rendering an
   element via CSS or SVG can conceptually described as if the
   element, including its children, are drawn into a buffer (such
   as a raster image) and then that buffer is composited into the
   elements parent. Filters apply an effect before the compositing
   stage. Examples of such effects are blurring, changing color
   intensity and warping the image. Learn more about the Style
   Activity.

Nine HTML5 Drafts Updated

   25 October 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9615

   The HTML Working Group has published nine updated working
   drafts:

   http://www.w3.org/html/wg/
     * The HTML5 specification
     * HTML5: Edition for Web Authors
     * HTML5 differences from HTML4
     * HTML Microdata
     * HTML Canvas 2D Context
     * HTML5: Techniques for providing useful text alternatives
     * Polyglot Markup: HTML-Compatible XHTML Documents
     * HTML to Platform Accessibility APIs Implementation Guide
     * HTML: The Markup Language

   There is a "list of the changes made to the HTML5
   specification" since publication of the previous HTML Working
   Draft (March 2012). The changes are essentially fine-tuning
   refinements rather than major new additions, in keeping with
   the progress of the specification toward greater stability, and
   transitioning toward an upcoming Candidate Recommendation
   draft.

Linked Data Platform 1.0 Draft Published

   25 October 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9614

   The Linked Data Platform (LDP) Working Group has published the
   First Public Working Draft of "Linked Data Platform 1.0." A
   set of best practices and simple approach for a read-write
   Linked Data architecture, based on HTTP access to web resources
   that describe their state using RDF. Learn more about the
   Semantic Web Activity.

Last Call: Best Practices for Fragment Identifiers and Media Type
Definitions

   25 October 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9613

   The Technical Architecture Group has published a Last Call
   Working Draft of "Best Practices for Fragment Identifiers and
   Media Type Definitions." Fragment identifiers (fragids) within
   URIs are specified as being interpreted based on the media type
   of a representation. Media type definitions therefore have to
   provide details about how fragids are interpreted for that
   media type. This document recommends best practices for the
   authors of media type definitions, for the authors of
   structured syntax suffix registrations (such as +xml), for the
   authors of specifications that define fragid structures, and
   for authors that publish documents that are intended to be used
   with fragids or who refer to fragments within documents using
   URIs with fragids. Comments are welcome through 13 December.

Web MIDI API Draft Published

   25 October 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9612

   The Audio Working Group has published the First Public Working
   Draft of "Web MIDI API." This specification defines an API
   supporting the MIDI protocol, enabling web applications to
   enumerate and select MIDI input and output devices on the
   client system and send and receive MIDI messages. It is
   intended to enable non-music MIDI applications as well as music
   ones, by providing low-level access to the MIDI devices
   available on the users' systems. At the same time, the Web MIDI
   API is not intended to become a semantic controller platform;
   it is designed to expose the mechanics of MIDI input and output
   interfaces, and the practical aspects of sending and receiving
   MIDI messages, without identifying what those actions might
   mean semantically. Learn more about the Rich Web Client
   Activity.

   25 October 2012 | Archive

   http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9611

   The Multimodal Interaction Working Group a W3C Recommendation
   of "Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces." This document
   describes a loosely coupled architecture for multimodal user
   interfaces, which allows for co-resident and distributed
   implementations, and focuses on the role of markup and
   scripting, and the use of well defined interfaces between its
   constituents. Learn more about the Multimodal Interaction
   Activity.
