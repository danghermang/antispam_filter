At the time, I could not tell if Mikel had deliberately kicked the ball into
touch to allow Terry to get treatment or if he had kicked the ball into 
touch
because he had no other option. Either way, I noticed that Liverpool did not
give the ball back to Chelsea when play resumed.

After the Reading and ManU games earlier in the season, where both teams
kicked the ball into touch near our corner flag, rather than simply kicking
the ball down the pitch to Cech, it seems that the tradition of simply
giving the ball back to the other team, once play resumes, is going out of
fashion.

Chelsea also had possession when play stopped for Gerrard's injury. Howard
Webb seemed to have a long discussion with Carragher when play resumed -
as if he was trying to convince him that, yes, he had to give the ball back 
to us.
