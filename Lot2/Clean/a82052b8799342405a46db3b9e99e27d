Subject:Re: [Antenna-discussion] 1/2-wave vertical really needs a ground

Ward

An end-fed halfwave can be resonant but it only has one terminal - the
end of the wire.  Some other structure is needed to connect the other
side of the feeder to.  That other piece is also part of the antenna.

If the end-fed is fed from the centre of a coax cable, the current on
the inner side of the sheath wraps round and travels back down on the
outer of the cable, so it becomes a radiating wire :)
