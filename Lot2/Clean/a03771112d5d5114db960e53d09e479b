Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Torres
Someone else said he played ok until he failed to won a foul on the edge
of the box, the moped around for the rest of the game. Any truth in that
- I wasn't there.

Others have pointed out that his involvement during the second half
goals was just watching in confusion as the game went on around him. His
movement for the final goal, behind Sturridge, has been said to be in
marked contrast. Sturridge, ducking & diving behind the only defender,
Torres stationary behind.

I know which I believe, but a confirmation will help me feel
justified...

Harry
