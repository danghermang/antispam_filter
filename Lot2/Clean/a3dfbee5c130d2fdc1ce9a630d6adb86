Subject:Re: [Jukebox-list] Rock-Ola 507 Wallbox


Thanks, Jeff I've seen that, but the 500  is a Phonette box with 10 buttons 
vertically down each side and with the "book" pages.

The 507 has  a similar button display  to Rock-Ola jukeboxes of the 
seventies and eighties with just the ten buttons along the bottom and it has 
the  title cards on a roller.

I have e-mailed them to ask if they've a compatible kit,  but not as yet had 
a reply, but it was only a couple of days ago, so they might not have got 
round to  my e-mail.

Thanks anyway.

Bob.

Check out

It lists the various wall boxes it's compatible with (RO 500 is listed)
