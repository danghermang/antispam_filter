Using a radio signal as a test signal. Let me tell you the whole wierd prob=
lem with this jukebox. When I first powered up the jukebox, there were lots=
 of selections written in to the tormat that I had to cancel out to get the=
 juke to the rest position. During the zeroizing process, I could hear the =
audio and it was loud and clear. The guy told me that after it warmed up aw=
hile he would hear a crackling noise coming from the speakers. Well, after =
it warmed up a bit, I could hear the crackling and popping noise start , an=
d I lost all audio, at the same time, all selections were written into the =
tormat. Could a stray high voltage from the amp somehow feedback into the j=
uke and cause the tormat to go squirrely? Not sure if I have one problem or=
 two. Definately lost my audio though. Jim

Jim, you go from Pin 6 into 7, Pin 8 into 9.

It doesn't matter if that crosses channels.

As for the ground just connect whatever signal source you are using to chas=
sis ground, or you can Pin 1 on the V.C. plug.

What are you using for a test signal?

BTW: I see that Vern Tisdale has schematics for this amp:
