Subject:[Chelsea] Scum
There were four big referee decisions today.
Luiz & VPN had not been getting on together very well.  VPN elbowed DL in
the face. No Call.

Does Ivanovic make any contact with the Known Diver Young?  If the answer
is yes, then the send off is for DOGSO.  You can't have a simple foul or
caution in that situation.

Torres is fouled.  YC for Evans is expected.  Does the ref now have diving
on his mind???

The offside goal.  The poo were denied a good goal for OS today and Manure
were given a goal when OS.

Shame.
