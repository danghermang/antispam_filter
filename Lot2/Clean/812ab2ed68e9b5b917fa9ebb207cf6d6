Subject:Re: [Flexradio] [FlexEdge] Computer requirements for 6000 series
Good update Tim

I like your comment on wireless.   99% of the wireless Lans are only able
to accommodate about 5 connections moving data at the same time.  This
includes anything made by Cisco, Linksys, Apple, etc.  Certainly, anything
you buy in a big box store.

Meru, which most of you have never heard of, is the only brand that will
work, but it requires the use of their controller and their access points.
 I worked for a company that did commercial Wifi and we spent months in our
Lab showing that once you get past about 6 Wife connections on a single
access point, clients start to drop their connection.   I have bought Meru
APs and Controllers on eBay pretty cheaply, but setting them up is not a
simple process.

I am sure that most of you with kids are seeing that now with what seems
like bandwidth issues.  Don't blame your ISP.  It is your wifi.

I have another question.  I am thinking of using a 6500 at my remote base,
and I am curious if that is even possible?  My max upload is about 700kbs
and the latency is about 40ms round trip.

What would be your thoughts?
