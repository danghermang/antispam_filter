Subject:Re: [h-cost] Embroiderry software

I have a commercial embroidery machine and we recently lost useability of the digitizing programme I had. Watch that whatever you buy will work on subsequent computers if you are spending a lot. Pulse designed for 32 bit computers will NOT work on 64 bit !! The upgrade is a mere $5000. Pretty steep when it was them that didn't consider future compatibilty. Wilcom offers similar features and a similar price for a trade in. They really seem to be the biggest commercial brands (in English speaking countries anyway)Having said that, there is freebie stuff around e.g. Sofiesew and Thread. Both have strengths and weaknesses. For a full commercial grade software, I-cliqq is pretty good value for money, but it is still expensive for fully functional software rather than limited size/ stitch numbers or rearranging existing designs. You can buy or commission a lot of designs for the price of the software. If you do commission a design, specify what textural finish you want or you will!
  get satin stitch by default, which is not always appropriate. I know my requirements a different from a domestic machine, but if you are doing costume work you will also need to have options for underlay stitches and changing density to account for differing fabrics. Some of the cheaper domestic programs may not have many options.Feel free to contact me for any other information. I hope to have my new software in the next week or so and may be able to take digitizing commissions as soon as I am up and running. At least a fellow costumer will have a better idea of authentic look than some off shore cheapie firms.

Although it would be nice to do hand embroidery, realistically I have 
too many other things on my schedule.  For a while I toyed with the idea 
of getting a  high-end sewing/embroidery machine, but I already have two 
perfectly good sewing machines and a huge price tag is a bit 
intimidating.  I am thinking of buying a Brother PE770, which is a 
fairly inexpensive dedicated embroidery machine.  It takes a flash drive 
so I can import designs from my computer.
 
I want to do historic embroidery designs and I want to create or at 
least customize my own.  I'm used to using graphic design software (scan 
editing and draw programs), but I know little about embroidery design 
software.  Any suggestions?
