Subject:Re: [child_lit] I've written to Hotmail
Thank you so much, Michael!

It certainly hasn't dropped off for me: 6 new ones this morning... I think
about 30% of my mail is now spam of this sort: no longer always the
"Critical Terms" subject line... It seems to be spreading. I will track
back all I have received and send a note off to Hotmail, as well. Thank
you for the suggestion, Michael, and for all your work.
