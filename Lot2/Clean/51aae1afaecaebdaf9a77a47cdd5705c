Subject:Re: [EVDL] 3D modeling
Hi Jukka,

I would find the scanning and 3d model you could build from the scans
invaluable.  I went through rearranging my batteries and adding boxes around
them last winter.  Even though the batteries originally fit and I was making
fairly small changes, the process was still nerve-wracking because I was
working blind.  I was also turning the top battery pack around so it could
still clear the brake master cylinder when the box was added.

I increased the height of the batteries 3/4" when I added the box and top
cover.  I lowered the rack about 1/2" to compensate, but I was still very
concerned how it was all going to fit.  Luckily, the hood ribs were in just
the right places and I only had to round a corner or two to get the hood
closed.  I would gladly have paid a few hundred dollars for a service that
would have told me where the batteries and hood would be when I closed the
hood!  I had to make do with sticky notes and clay to see where the tight
spots were.

In a Honda del Sol, things are just that tight!

I would probably be less interested in the custom battery packs at this
point, but maybe if I ever did another conversion.

Mike
