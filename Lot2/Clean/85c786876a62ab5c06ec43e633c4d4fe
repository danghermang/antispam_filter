Subject:Re: [EVDL] Cross Country EV?under 20K
I really like the "mobile battery pack" concept.  (go from coast to coast,
pick up a new shipment of batteries at a port, and head back across the
country...)  RV park to RV park is probably the ideal way to go.  A natural
way to meet many customers, especially if you have a small EV in tow that
can be used for errands/marketing/joy rides.  The RV crowd also commonly
tows around a "gas" car which is used for small trips.  These could be
electric.  Finally, it might be worth a few extra bucks to stay at the
fancier RV parks as the folks who want to spend $5 more a night are the
same folks who have the cash on hand to pull the trigger on a conversion.
Cheers,
Marcus
