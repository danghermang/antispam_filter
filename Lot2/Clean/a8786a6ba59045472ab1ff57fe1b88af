Subject:Re: [Hsqldb-user] Re g: Not able to load a csv file into hsqldb
 using sqltool which is having the quotes(") in some columns

First CREATE the TEXT TABLE (you can use VARCHAR(nnn) as column type).

Then SET TABLE textable SOURCE with your file and separator settings.

Then INSERT INTO memtable SELECT * FROM texttable

Finally DROP the texttable
