Tore, hi

Well, there are probably many consolidated LIRs here. I personally know 
of few of them. Nick showed some numbers (thnx) - but I would suggest to 
ask RIPE-NCC staff for the "consolidated-LIRs-with-multiple-/32" numbers 
- what is this number we are talking about.

Good point, agree. We ran into small procedural inconvenience that 
should be fixed imho.
