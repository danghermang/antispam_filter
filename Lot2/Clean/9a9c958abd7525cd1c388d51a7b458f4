Subject:[Jukebox-list] storm prep
Greetings from South Jersey,
All equipment in my shop is up on blocks and pallets. Deptford NJ already
has 2500 without power. They are 10 miles from Philly. Winds are starting
to kick up. We're expected to see landfall in this area, between Atlantic
City and Cape May. I'm about 40 miles inland. Gonna get real wet here. But
I have enough beer for a week.
Gary
