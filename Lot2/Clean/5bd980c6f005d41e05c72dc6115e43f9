Subject:Re: [Chelsea] PFA chairman Clarke Carlisle defends FA and Chelsea
 over handling of Mark Clattenburg affair [Sky]
I wonder, as I do with other race based organsiations, what would happen if I, as a Caucasian male, were to apply were I to have the requisite competence. Things such as erm The Society of Black Lawyers, the Maori All Blacks, any women only gym. And could I accuse them of race or gender discrimination were I declined. 
It all seems a bit one way.
