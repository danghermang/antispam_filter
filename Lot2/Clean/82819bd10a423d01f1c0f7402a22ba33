Scope
Education is one domain that has accompanied civilization through the =

centuries, adapting its tools to fulfill the expectations of the =

students and the needs of the teachers. Such tools can be as obvious and =

traditional as pencils and a notebook, or as complex and innovative as =

websites and multi-user virtual environments. Typical in-person learning =

environments, such as classrooms and meeting rooms, are at times not the =

best solution to enable and maximize a student=92s ability to learn. =

Although they do fulfill their purpose of giving students the =

possibility of reaching course material and instructors, they also =

create a barrier that cannot be easily overcome.

Web-based instruction and multi-user virtual environments break the =

time-limited barrier innate to typical lectures and explore, through =

innovative technologies, a concept as old as humankind: socialization =

and the feeling of belonging to a community. Many universities, public =

institutions and private businesses are projecting themselves on the =

Internet and in virtual worlds to reach the customer at any time, giving =

them the idea of virtual presence that cannot be delivered through a =

simple website.

Topics to be discussed in this journal focus on (but not limited to) the =

following concepts:
=95 Teaching / Educational Models and Frameworks
=95 Accessibility and usability of web-based instruction in the classroom
=95 Best Practices
=95 Developing courses and content to be used in on-line educational =

environments
=95 Student engagement
=95 Experiments
=95 Impacts of on-line on traditional teaching and learning strategies

Unique Advantages of Publishing with ICST
ICST offers authors the revolutionary e-SCRIPTS system =96 a Web 2.0-based =

peer-review and manuscript management application that guarantees =

objective and fast reviewing, through an innovative reviewer bidding =

process that automatically matches the most qualified reviewer to the =

paper based on internationally recognized indicators such as H-index. =

Also based on that, acceptance decisions are expected to be now made in =

weeks instead of many months. In addition, ICST provides extremely short =

publication times by posting the paper on-line immediately after =

acceptance and extreme visibility/impact to the scientific community via =

synergies with the other ICST tools such as EU Digital Library and a =

broad abstract dissemination channel without compromises on the =

protection of authors=92 intellectual property. All these innovative =

aspects are coupled with traditional elements of technical excellence, =

such as indexing by ISI, EI, DBLP, INSPEC, Google Scholar, and all other =

major indexing organizations, as well as ISSN registration.

In short: fast and high-quality review; rapid publication; innovative =

publishing tools; and decision-making really open to the community.
