Subject:[burners] Fwd: [OT] Help turning scanned sheet music into midi or
	mp3
Hi all,

A follow up to those who are interested.  Jeff Mission stepped up and took
this on.  It turned out to be quite a project, involving changing the
graphics format of the pictures to bitmaps, turning the output into a
MIDI-compatible text file, then turning the text file into actual sounds,
then turning those sounds again into yet other sounds.

For those who want to hear the results and know more about the process, his
email to me is forwarded below.

Although the files are listenable, I am also trying to get an actual human
pianist to play the piece.

Thanks, Jeff!!

OK, here are the results of my music archaeology.  I created a zip file
with the following:

- 3 high-contrast bitmaps of the sheet music (in case anyone else wants to
play with them)
- 3 MIDI files (.mid) These were generated by routing the MIDI output from
Photoscore through MIDI-OX, where it was logged as a text file. I then
converted the text files to MIDI files using the command line utility
t2mfXP.
- 3 mp3s  I imported the MIDI files into Ableton, selected a droney synth,
and recorded the output.
