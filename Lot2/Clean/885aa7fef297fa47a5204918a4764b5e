Subject:[anti-abuse-wg] Implementation of 2011-06
Colleagues,

Hopefully by now you have all read the mail from the NCC Database Group 
regarding the implementation plan for Policy 2011-06 sent on the 15th of 
November 2012.

The Co-Chairs of the Anti-Abuse and Database WGs have conferred and we 
feel that while there have been a few questions regarding this plan, 
these have been answered and there were no objections so consensus has 
been reached in this regard.

With this support from the community in mind, the Co-Chairs have asked 
the NCC to begin work on this implementation and to keep both WGs 
updated on their progress.

As always, if you have any questions, please do raise them on the 
mailing lists.

Brian,
On behalf of the Co-Chairs of the AA-WG & DB-WG
