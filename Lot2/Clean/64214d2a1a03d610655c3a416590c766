Subject:Re: [Flexradio] Problem with high DPC count after upgrading to W8
	Pro
Hi Les,

Same situation experienced here on Saturday Afternoon after my upgrade to W8
Pro.....
Running an Intel  Quad Core CPU which previously performed very well on W7.

After booting W8 - (at least for the first 15-30 minutes), The 5000A (under
PSDR 2.4.4) really battles to stabilize.  It got so bad at times that the
audio just died completely. 
 When checking the DPC Counters,  I noticed the counters above > 1000 (and
as high as >10000), incrementing occasionally.....I never noticed this
before when running W7

I have already managed some improvement by performing a general clean-up of
Processes, Services and applications on the PC. 
I now only Power-off or reset the PC when I really have to and things are
going relatively OK but I am still  monitoring the PC's latency on a regular
basis ......

I am considering moving back to W7 again.  Waiting to see what experience
other Flexers are having with W8.

Thank you for taking the time to raise this.

Subject: [Flexradio] Problem with high DPC count after upgrading to W8 Pro

Hi All
Have just upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 8 Pro Computer is Asus
m/b M4A78-VM - processor is 3.1g  AMD Phenom(tm) II X2
550 Processor Socket AM3 (938)
with 4g ram - radio is Flex 3000

This system has been running well on W7 ultimate with dpc count of less than
100us normally around the 75us Now with the upgrade to W8 Pro dpc is around
1000us LatencyMon reports Current measured kernel timer latency around 12 to
16us with Highest measured kernel timer latency as 1000 to 1009us
Transmitting using EasyPal gives regular breaks in tx audio with receiving
station reporting no lock on signal

Anyone got any ideas on how to reduce the dpc spikes or will it be a trip
down the W7 reinstallation path???
So far have not been able to work out if it is possible to uninstall W8 back
to W7

I have an image of the system from september 9 but W8 doesnt want to know
about it

Regards
Les VK2DSG
