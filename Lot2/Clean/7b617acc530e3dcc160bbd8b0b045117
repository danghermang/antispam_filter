Maybe, but people have been charging EVs with 3kW, 2kW, even 1kW chargers 
for years.  If your range needs are modest, there's nothing wrong with a low 
power charger.  

One of the positives of a smaller charger like this is that draws no more 
power than a space heater.  That means you can charge almost anywhere on 
120v, without fear of tripping your good Samaritan's circuit breaker.  And 
unless you have a battery that needs a big initial sock (like the old Hawker 
Genesis did), low current charging is usually better for the battery.
