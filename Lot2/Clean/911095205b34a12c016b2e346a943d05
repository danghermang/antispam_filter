Subject:Re: [EVDL] Pack Cooling
So the Thundersky graph showing ~10% capacity loss at 0 deg F is completely
bogus?

The EVTV testing showed the initial sag WAS pretty severe, but then
internal heating caused the cell to recover and deliver pretty good
performance after a bit.  Is it possible the 'alarms' are going off on that
initial sag and folks aren't continuing to pull amps for fear that it will
only get worse?
