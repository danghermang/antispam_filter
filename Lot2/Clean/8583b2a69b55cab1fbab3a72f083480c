Subject:RE: [Jukebox-list] Rowe Ami mm3 latch solenoid info needed
Rob,
  Thanks, if you wouldn't mind sending me the page that describes the latch=
 circuit for the MM-2, I bet they are close enough that I can figure out wh=
at the MM-3 is trying to do.   I should have both 30 dc and 30 ac at the bu=
tton panel, and even though the continental 2 operates the latch solenoid t=
he opposite way they both energize the latch relay the same way I should be=
 fine. =20
  Once I find extra sockets and plug I will start morphing the two together=
.  Soon I'll be able to actually use my continental!

Ed, I only have diagrams for MM-2 but as for voltages -all Rowe machines of=
 that era used 30vac for the latch solenoid which was controlled by a 30vdc=
 relay.

The solenoid should be easy since it was common to so many models, the link=
age -may- vary.

Hello,
=A0 I have a Rowe Ami MM3 button assembly, not the entire jukebox.=A0=A0=A0=
What is the voltage of the latch solenoid?
=A0 Does anyone have a diagram or schematic that describes the circuit for =
the latch solenoid?=A0 Maybe one for the selection circuit?
 I wish to use the original latch and hold circuit or something close to it=
.

=A0 I have asked a lot of questions but not specific enough and have gotten=
 no reply's, so here I go again.
