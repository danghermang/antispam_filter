I would also add that one reason David Luiz ran so far with the ball was because no-one was making themselves available

So the 3 or 4 vital interceptions & last ditch (goal saving) tackles
don't count? the penalty dispatched? the superb free kick? the
reasonably dominant display (with Cahill) in the air defensively?

We're playing a risk game with the (no alternative - no hold-up
capability up front) play out from the back (Romeu likewise). Any
tactically astute opposition knows this and presses us hard high up the
pitch...the chances of ANY of our defenders/midfield being caught in
possession is much higher...I'd say the majority of the goals conceded
have come from those turnovers.

Luiz is a supremely talented footballer, with innate self belief, he'll
try to go past people & it wont always work & unfortunately too often
we're being punished by conceding. He has tried to temper his game with
hoof it out clearances more apparent.

I just hate the fact that people only seem to notice the mistakes...on
that basis Sturridge must be off the radar with you? And, even Moses
(who was one of our better players, first 60 minutes) ricked twice as
much! Compare them with how clinical Man Utd were (or Shaktar) in front
of goal. Such profligacy will cost us many more times that Luiz getting
disposessed.

What is that man doing? He is now one of the senior players on the pitch
and playing like a twat yet again.
