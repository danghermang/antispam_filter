I think discharge is normally ignored because the controller itself 
draws power from the capacitors. This will discharge the capacitors 
without the need for any extra circuitry. Within a minute or so, the 
capacitors would be discharged.

If the design of the Revolt controller does not do this, then you are 
correct; it would be prudent to add a resistor or equivalent to 
discharge the capacitors.

My practice has been to include an indicator light across the controller 
B+ and B- input. This warns me when it is "live", and also provides a 
discharge path. It can be a 4w light bulb, neon light, or LED with a 
suitable series resistor.

Probably because they connect to different places, and have different 
resistor values. The precharge resistance is usually quite low, to 
precharge quickly. The discharge resistance can be much larger, as there 
is no hurry -- you shouldn't be able to turn off the car and physically 
get at the controller terminals in less than a minute.

That can work. However, it does put B+ and B- right next to each other 
on the same relay. Be sure that the relay has enough spacing so this is 
safe. It would be a wonderful place to drop a screw or for a bug to 
crawl across.
