Subject:[CT Birds] Afternoon Birds!
This afternoon around 4:20pm, birds began to cover my backyard. There must have been a bird every 2-3 feet everywhere I looked- mostly AMERICAN ROBINS. In the mix there were  JUNCOS (male and female),  WHITE CROWNED SPARROWS,  SONG SPARROWS and MOCKINGBIRDS. Though none of these are very unusual for the fall, the number of arrivals  was still a sight to see.
