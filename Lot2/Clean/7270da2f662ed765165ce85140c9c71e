Subject:[EVDL] Elcon PFC 1500 Died
Troubles again ... my upgraded Leopard's charger, an Elcon PFC 1500, decided
to quit on me.  The LED doesn't blink, the relay closes (from my Lithiumate
Lite BMS), but I get no current.  It died, as far as I can tell, when
charging off of a standard 120vac just 10% from reaching a full charge on my
120vdc pack.  

I'm depressed to think that I have to pack it up and ship it back to
California after getting only about 5 full cycles out of it after they
reprogrammed it for the 38xCALB 130ah lithium pack.  (They reprogrammed it
to curve 520, to 137 volts).  

1.- What's the typical reason for such a failure?  (I'm not ruling out my
doing something stupid / or at least not good for it - though it seems like
I would not have gotten the 5 cycles out of it if I had).  

2.- Does anybody have experience with this kind problem with their Elcon? 
If yes, are there some things I can do to diagnose (or better yet fix), the
problem?

3.- If it is the AC fuse (as support at Elcon has suggested), is this
something I could try on my own instead of being down for a couple weeks and
paying for shipping?  (I realize this is more a question for Elcon and would
perhaps void any warranty [see q#4 below], but wondered if anyone had tried
it).  

4.- Should they cover this under a warranty?


Thanks - Dan
