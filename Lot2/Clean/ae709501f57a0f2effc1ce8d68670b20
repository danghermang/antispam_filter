That would be the one thing he most definitely has not been short of since arriving 22 months ago. 

Rarely have I seen a player get such support at the ground. Not since Joe Cole in fact. Before that Shevchenko, and before that Kezman. The support he gets from the match going fans has surpassed them all. 

I can't think of any more excuses that could be used in Torres' favour. Not one.
