Subject:[burners] OT: Wombat and fire fans class
*Hey guys,*
*
I'm teaching a fire fan class at wombat this saturday for those of you who
are interested.  It's $10 for a day of lessons.  (not from me but at Tufts
in general... see information below.)  My class is 11am to 11:50am.  I'll
be going over tons of intro fan moves.*

WOMBAT!

On November 17-18, 2012, The Tufts Jumbo Jugglers in conjunction with the
organizers of Medford Spinjam, will be hosting their second object
manipulation workshop series at Tufts University in Medford, MA.

Last winter we held over 30 workshops on poi spinning, juggling, hooping,
staff spinning, and much more, with classes for spinners of all levels.
Instructors came from as far as New York, Maine, and Toronto to bring new
knowledge and enthusiasm into our community.

This year we've got a bigger, better space and are hoping to have just as
amazing an event! To support this venue and our traveling teachers, there
will be a $10 fee for Saturday's classes. If this is an issue for you,
please contact us
<https://www.sites.google.com/site/objectmanipulationbootcamp/contact-us>and
we'll work something out.
