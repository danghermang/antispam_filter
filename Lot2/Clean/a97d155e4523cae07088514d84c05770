Ward,

Everything you said sounds good to me.

Kirk:
   I recognize that there is some risk in getting scorched here=85..

   I'm sure I'm not alone in my attempt to follow this thread.  I
guess I'm rather lackadaisical on this topic and really only interested
in the most significant bits.
   I'm beginning to piece together a basic understanding but it is
difficult when different people use similar words to convey the
seemingly different concepts.  Allow me to try to reword things
a bit.
   I'm thinking mostly about the ferrite antenna discussion but
trying to make sure it applies to other small antennas as well.

   It appears the there is a theoretical limit on the amount of
power a small antenna can intercept.  That power being:

3/8 * lambda^2/pi

I think of this as the "Available Power"=85 power which
could conceivably be delivered to a load.  This equation
says nothing about how the energy will be captured=85 we
could use elves and demons if they cooperated.

If we now consider building a small antenna system in various ways
we enter the realm of what I consider engineering rather than
physics.  We now deal with the practical problems of lossy
materials, electronic circuits, and physical construction.

We first need to invoke the "maximum power" theory.  Since
our antenna has an internal impedance we will need to match
our load to that internal impedance in order to maximize
power delivered.  Of course, to effect this match, we may
well design our antenna with a convenient internal impedance;
one easily matched to our load.  That trade-off is what engineering
is all about.

If I understand things correctly, the ferrite has the effect of
increasing the voltage I can deliver from the coil of wire.
The value of increasing voltage is that, for a given power,
the current is reduced.  I want to reduce currents because
losses grow like I^2.

But, just to be clear, the ferrite has not affected the "available power",
it has only made it easier to deliver that power within the
constraints of lossy materials and electronic circuits.

Earlier in the discussion, someone mentioned that one view
was that the ferrite acted as an 'Impedance Transform' between
free space and the volume inside the coil.  The ferrite changes
the permeability of that region.  That change in permeability
changes the relative magnitudes of the E and B fields.  That sounds
like a classical transformer to me.

From a different perspective, Ampere's law says that increasing
the permeability will reduce the current in the coil.  Given
constant power, reduced current means increased voltage=85..

It isn't surprising that various shapes of ferrite would have
differing effects on the 'effective permeability' within the
coil.  Understanding how the ferrite can best affect that
permeability seems the be the engineering problem at hand.

Am I way off base here?
