Subject:Unable to install package xen-linux-system-3.2.0-0.bpo.4-amd64
Hey.
I'm trying to get Ganeti going on some new Dell R620.

The kernel from Squeeze isn't able to find the storage controller in
these boxes,
but the installer from http://kmuto.jp/debian/d-i/ works great.
I'm running the linux-image-3.2.0-0.bpo.4-amd64 kernel now.

I'm having problems installing the Xen kernel.
The package xen-linux-system-amd64 looks to be about right,
but the install fails.

torbjorn@xen13:~$ aptitude install -sy xen-linux-system-amd64
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  xen-linux-system-3.2.0-0.bpo.4-amd64{ab} xen-linux-system-amd64
0 packages upgraded, 2 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 190 kB of archives. After unpacking 250 kB will be used.
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  xen-linux-system-3.2.0-0.bpo.4-amd64: Depends: xen-system-amd64
which is a virtual package.
The following actions will resolve these dependencies:

     Keep the following packages at their current version:
1)     xen-linux-system-3.2.0-0.bpo.4-amd64 [Not Installed]
2)     xen-linux-system-amd64 [Not Installed]



No packages will be installed, upgraded, or removed.
0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 0 B of archives. After unpacking 0 B will be used.
Would download/install/remove packages.
torbjorn@xen13:~$


Looking at the xen-system-amd64 depency, we see this:

torbjorn@xen13:~$ aptitude show xen-system-amd64
No current or candidate version found for xen-system-amd64
Package: xen-system-amd64
State: not a real package


Looking at the results from
http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=3Dxen-system-amd64,
it seems to be me that the xen-system-amd64 package is not in squeeze
or squeee-backports.

Am I correct in my understanding that the
xen-linux-system-3.2.0-0.bpo.4-amd64 package
is not installable with only squeeze and squeeze-backports package availabl=
e ?
