Subject:Re: [Chelsea] Bertrand interview in the Times
I read it yesterday, and it seemed pretty straightforward

I came to Chelsea and like all my peers I went on loan a lot. - we used to joke about who'd go next
I realised last year that once they said I wasn't going on loan this was my chance to impress, and I had to knuckle down
I never thought I'd play in the CL Final and told my mum not to go - I was going to give my tickets to players who were playing as they'd need them more
Even when I played in front of Ash in training games the week before I still wasn't expecting to play

Does that sound weird?

Does anyone have access to the Bertrand interview in the Times on Sunday?

Sounds a bit weird
