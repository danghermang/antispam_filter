OK, thanks! =A0I guess the good news is I rarely use the heater, and never =
for more than 5 minutes at a time... =A0playing with fire I guess though. =
=A0It would be even worse at 185v right?

>Almost all of these heater physically consist of 4 separate elements, whic=
h can be connected all in parallel (for 120v) or in series pairs (for 240v)=
. I would suggest wiring them for 240v in your case. Then use *two* of them=
 to get the desired amount of heat. This will greatly reduce the stress on =
them, for a longer life and safer operation.


Right now there are two elements already in the dash wired in parallel. =A0=
I've never used the second one, it would be too much heat (and power use). =
=A0So if I go into the dash and rewire the elements into series pairs, and =
leave the two elements in parallel, I could use both elements at 185v safel=
y? =A0It would be underpowered, but with two elements maybe it would match =
what I have right now with one element running overloaded? =A0Bummer to hav=
e to pull the dash out to get to the wiring, but at least the two elements =
are already in there.

Thanks,
David.
