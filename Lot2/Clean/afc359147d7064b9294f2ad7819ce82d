Thanks=A0Glenn and others who took a look at my mystery bird. It is the Bla=
ck-headed Saltator. Once I had a name it was easier to go back to the books=
 to take a closer look. From the images=A0it was=A0hard to guess the real c=
olors on the back of the bird. We came home with some 25 new brids from jus=
t the immediate resort property. Great spot for a field trip!

It looks like a saltator, but I don't know my tropical birds so I can't tel=
l you the exact species.=A0 I don't get out of New England much.
