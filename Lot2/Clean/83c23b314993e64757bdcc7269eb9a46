Subject:Re: [EVDL] Best EV Tires
I used to keep a keen eye on my regular commute with my 2002 Prius
and noticed that I took about 5% MPG hit at the moment that I
replaced the tires. I started inquiring and found out that this
is usual - new tires have more friction due to the thicker layer
of rubber that is compressing and expanding and thus generating
heat from movement, hence more loss. With the wearing down
(and stiffening from aging) tires get lower in rolling resistance.

I don't have a lot of data, but have tried two types of tires.

On my ICE (2000 Mazda 626 V6) I have the Michelin Energy Saver A/S.
.Those tires (running at sidewall max pressure) gained at least 5% MPG
compared to my previous tires (Toyo Z800 Ultras well worn).  I really
like those tires and would have gotten the same tires for my EV if the
rim and tire size I needed was available.  On those tires, it feels like
the Mazda can coast forever.  They are also wearing very well.

My EV has Pirelli P6 LRR all-season tires.  They also seem to be wearing
very well.  The EV doesn't coast as well, but I don't think it's the
tires.  I have a slight brake drag on both front wheels that I haven't
been able to find.
