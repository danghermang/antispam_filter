Subject:[child_lit] Waterloo - continuing to be OK
There are quite a lot of place names in Belgium/Netherlands ending in -loo

Anloo
Balloo
Eldersloo
Exloo
Fochteloo
Grollo
Heiloo
Loo
Oploo
Paasloo
Schoonloo
Zweeloo

Etymology of place names is fraught with difficulty so whether the -loo 
in these is the same as in Waterloo I couldn't be sure, but just thought 
it would be interesting to show -loo in other contexts.

As to Dutch being the closest language to English, many linguists would 
say Frisian is more closely related. Here's a fab clip of one of my 
favourite comedians, Eddie Izzard, trying to hold a conversation with a 
Frisian farmer by talking in Old English...

Zoe (a linguist in a previous life, married to a Dutch man whose mother 
is Frisian, and whose daughter is named after a Frisian children's 
writer....)
