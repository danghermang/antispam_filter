Subject:Re: [child_lit] Children's books inspired by specific artefacts on
 public display in museums (any where in the world)?
This discussion sparked the memory of a book I loved, Inge Fischer's 
/Christophe in Egypt: the odyssey of Pharaoh's cat/ (New York: Lion 
Press, 1968).  Christophe, a New York cat visits the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art's Egyptian galleries and finds himself transported back to 
Ancient Egypt.  I think the galleries are described pretty accurately.  
I also think there are other books that describe those galleries....

Yours,
Jenny
