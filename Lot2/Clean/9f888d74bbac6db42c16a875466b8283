Unfortunately I can't tell you if that is correct, as I am not a
lawyer, and I also find the documentation somewhat confusing. I was
hoping osmf could put out some specific examples of attribution, but
so far haven't seen any.

But the above wording would correspond to how I would interpret the
legal FAQ. So unless we can get some advise from the wikimedia legal
team, I would suggest to just use that wording and should OSMF
complain be prepared to change it.

With respect to the license of tiles: This has been a somewhat
controversial debate what licenses "produced works" can actually be
under. Particularly can it be under CC-0. My understand would be it
can't as the ODbL requires the produced work to contain a notice that
it is produced from data under the ODbL. So I think, an attribution
license, like CC BY is the minimum the produced work can be under.

I am not sure if the license the style sheet is under plays any role
in what the tiles are licensed at. I think it can be anything, as has
been the case while data and tiles were CC BY-SA.

But I am not a lawyer, so I don't really know.

P.S. Otherwise, it sounds like no objections to re-importing. So as
soon as I can free enough space on the partition, I will begin the new
import. But it will likely be another couple of days (or more) before
it is complete.
