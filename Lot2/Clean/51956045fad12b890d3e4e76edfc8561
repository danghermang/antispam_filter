<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:16px;">Even if you already have a stand, it's not=

andscape or portrait-style viewing. <strong>But this one does, because it's=
 BRILLIANT!</strong></span></p>
<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size: 16px;">Because this v-frame stand is pretty much=
 universal,</span><span style=3D"color:#ff0000;"><strong><span style=3D"fon=

ovies or videos, giving presentations</strong></span>, ANY situation where =
you want to use your tablet.</span></p>

<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:16px;">Oh, and when you're done with it?<strong> =
<u>Just fold it up and pack it away</u>. Yep, it folds right into itself fo=

<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:16px;">You'd be crazy not to grab one of these! E=

<p>
	<span style=3D"font-size:16px;">And really, calling it an MP3 player or a =

<p>
	<em><span style=3D"color:#0000ff;"><span style=3D"font-size: 16px;">Everyt=

it, cameras have a pretty impressive design, right? Think about it, we've b=
